EN_003	2	Orban: Gradual reopening may begin after Easter
EN_003	3	The faster we vaccinate, the sooner the number of infection cases and deaths will decrease.
EN_003	4	This is why it is important not to be deceived by those who promote anti-vaccination views, Viktor Orban stressed in his exclusive interview with Hungary's public broadcaster.
EN_003	5	The prime minister said he expects that the number of those vaccinated will reach two and a half million after Easter, allowing the country to gradually reopen.
EN_003	6	Asked why reaching 2.5 million jabs was set as the target for reopening to become an option, PM Orban said the country cannot be reopened before all those over the age of 65 have been vaccinated.
EN_003	7	"""It's our moral duty,"" he underlined."
EN_003	8	There is only one remedy that can help us slow down or kill the virus, and that is vaccination, so we must focus all our efforts on inoculation.
EN_003	9	Many have suffered serious losses and find it difficult to cope, the premier said.
EN_003	10	Once we have managed to contain the epidemic, we should not only restart the country's economy, but also reinvigorate community life.
EN_003	11	"""Everyone has lost their serenity, good spirit, and perhaps even happiness,"" Viktor Orban said."
EN_003	12	The virus brings harm not only to human life, but also destroys jobs and attacks the economy.
EN_003	13	Shops, factories or hotels cannot be reopened from one day to another, so it is important to let people know what to expect.
EN_003	14	Parents need to know when they can take their children to school or kindergarten again.
EN_003	15	"""We must maintain defence, administer vaccines and help people at the same time so that they can plan the reopening of their personal lives,"" PM Orban pointed out."
EN_003	16	Hungary's current vaccination rate is 20 per cent, well above the EU average of 12 per cent.
EN_003	17	PM Orban thanked doctors, general practioners and nurses for their work and superhuman efforts.
EN_003	18	"""Our doctors and nurses are saving everyone they can, as they put their heart and soul in their work."
EN_003	19	"I think those in the medical sector must continue their strenuous work, but but their numbers will be sufficient."""
EN_003	20	The government took into account the unions' request and fast-tracked the inoculation of teachers, Mr Orban said.
EN_003	21	He added that the first jab ensures a very high level of protection which, if administered one week before school reopenings, will enable teachers to switch to face-to-face education.
EN_003	22	Responding to the news that several Western countries are planning to buy Eastern jabs, PM Orban said he was quite certain that it would happen.
EN_003	23	It was clear as early as last November that the vaccines ordered from the West would not arrive in time.
EN_003	24	Each EU member state is entitled to place separate orders based on their own emergency protocols but, apart from Hungary, only Slovakia did so.
EN_003	25	This was rather risky and we have received numerous attacks, but I think we made the right decision and saved the lives of thousands of people.
EN_003	26	Regarding the departure of Hungary's ruling Fidesz party from the European People's Party (EPP), Mr Orban said that the move resulted in a clear situation.
EN_003	27	In Europe, those who reject migration and support the traditional family model, reject multicultural societies and want to maintain their national identity without having to live in a Brussels-centric European empire have no adequate representation.
EN_003	28	Those voters' representation is non-existent, or fragmented, at best.
EN_003	29	Italian Lega party leader Matteo Salvini, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban are slated to meet on Thursday to discuss the possibility of a new platform.
EN_003	30	Hungary is on the verge of victory, PM Orban said at the end of the interview.
EN_003	31	We will have another two to three tough weeks, but after that the uncertain voices will wane.
EN_003	32	Our summer will be sunny and happy, but our hearts are with those who have lost their family members and friends.
EN_003	33	We pray for them and we are preparing to regain or cheerful, happy and hopeful way of life, which is within an arm's reach now, PM Orban concluded the interview.
EN_015	1	The Pope Says 'Humanity Must Repent For Abusing Mother Earth'
EN_015	2	We humans “must repent and modify our lifestyles” because of our abuse of Mother Earth, Pope Francis states in a message released Thursday.
EN_015	3	In his Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, the pontiff decries the “mistreatment” of our common home stemming from “our consumerist excesses,” “tyrannical anthropocentrism,” “predatory economic interests,” and “short sighted and selfish actions” leading to “the collapse of our planet’s ecosystems.”
EN_015	4	“In the first place, it is our sister, mother earth, who cries out.
EN_015	5	Prey to our consumerist excesses, she weeps and implores us to put an end to our abuses and to her destruction,” Francis declares in his Message.
EN_015	6	Because of human irresponsibility “countless species are dying out and their hymns of praise silenced,” the pope laments, while the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples “are being invaded and devastated on all sides, ‘provoking a cry that rises up to heaven.’”
EN_015	7	Because of the “climate crisis,” the poor disproportionately suffer the impact of “the drought, flooding, hurricanes and heat waves that are becoming ever more intense and frequent,” the pope asserts.
EN_015	8	“Listening to these anguished cries, we must repent and modify our lifestyles and destructive systems,” Francis proposes, since the “present state of decay of our common home merits the same attention as other global challenges such as grave health crises and wars.”
EN_015	9	The ecological conversion needed to bring about lasting change cannot simply take place at the individual level, the pope insists, but must be “also a community conversion” embracing multilateral solutions, “especially in the meetings of the United Nations devoted to the environmental question.”
EN_015	10	In his Message, Francis also plugs the COP27 conference on climate change, to be held in Egypt in November 2022, which “represents the next opportunity for all to join in promoting the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.”
EN_015	11	The Holy See subscribes to the Paris goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C, Francis states, which “calls for responsible cooperation between all nations in presenting climate plans or more ambitious nationally determined contributions in order to reduce to zero, as quickly as possible, net greenhouse gas emissions.”
EN_015	12	“This means ‘converting’ models of consumption and production, as well as lifestyles, in a way more respectful of creation and the integral human development of all peoples, present and future,” he adds.
EN_015	13	“The transition brought about by this conversion cannot neglect the demands of justice, especially for those workers who are most affected by the impact of climate change.”
EN_015	14	Along with the UN climate conference, Francis underscores the importance of a UN summit on biodiversity, to be held in Canada in December, as a way to address “the double crisis of climate change and the reduction of biodiversity.”
EN_015	15	The summit “will offer to the goodwill of governments a significant opportunity to adopt a new multilateral agreement to halt the destruction of ecosystems and the extinction of species,” he states.
EN_015	16	The pontiff goes on to insist that wealthy nations have an “ecological debt” to poorer nations and must subsidize their transition to sustainable energy in reparation for their excesses.
EN_015	17	“How can we fail to acknowledge the existence of an ‘ecological debt’ incurred by the economically richer countries, who have polluted most in the last two centuries; this demands that they take more ambitious steps at COP27 and at COP15,” he declares.
EN_015	18	This debt also means “keeping their promises of financial and technical support for the economically poorer nations, which are already experiencing most of the burden of the climate crisis,” he proposes.
EN_015	19	“In the name of God, I ask the great extractive industries – mining, oil, forestry, real estate, agribusiness – to stop destroying forests, wetlands, and mountains, to stop polluting rivers and seas, to stop poisoning food and people.”
EN_015	20	“It is necessary for all of us to act decisively.
EN_015	21	For we are reaching ‘a breaking point,’” he states.
EN_015	22	As you can see the Pope is now a proponent of Gaia, aka “Mother Earth”… No he is not saying Humanity should repent for straying away from God, no, now humanity should apologize to Gaia!
EN_015	23	This personification of the Earth is pagan in origin and as you can see the Pope is anything BUT Christian.
EN_015	24	He is definitely spending way too much time with these pagan brown Indians… He is getting influenced by them, not by Jesus.
EN_023	1	Gove in Belfast to promote Trader Support Service to help NI businesses avoid Brexit red tape
EN_023	2	UP TO £355 million of taxpayers’ money will be used to help businesses in Northern Ireland cope with additional bureaucracy caused by Brexit.
EN_023	3	The funding, announced by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove as he visits Northern Ireland, will help firms deal with the paperwork associated with bringing goods in from Britain or the rest of the world.
EN_023	4	The new Trader Support Service is aimed at addressing concerns from Northern Ireland businesses that red tape could disrupt the flow of goods from Britain.
EN_023	5	An initial £50 million will set up the service, with the full contract worth up to £200 million.
EN_023	6	It will provide end-to-end support to deal with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.
EN_023	7	Businesses in Northern Ireland can sign up for further information about the scheme from today, before it becomes operational in September.
EN_023	8	A £155 million investment will fund the development of new technology to ensure the process can be fully digital and streamlined.
EN_023	9	The measures are needed because the Northern Ireland protocol requires it to remain in alignment with EU rules on goods, effectively creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea from 1 January after the transition period ends.
EN_023	10	That means that digital import and safety and security declarations will be needed to avoid tariffs on trade within the UK and that goods destined for Ireland or the EU pay tariffs when they should.
EN_023	11	The Trader Support Service will take care of those on businesses’ behalf at no cost, with officials indicating it should be seen as an enduring commitment rather than a short-term fix.
EN_023	12	Further support could be provided to cover health certification requirements for agrifoods.
EN_023	13	Separately, a further £300 million has been committed to the Peace Plus programme to support reconciliation projects across the island of Ireland from 2021-27.
EN_023	14	Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis will promote the package during a joint visit.
EN_023	15	“Today’s £650 million investment underlines our absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period,” Gove said.
EN_023	16	“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.
EN_035	1	Cork council chief admits retrofitting schemes are 'bamboozling'
EN_035	2	The Government announced its €8bn National Retrofitting Scheme a year ago, aiming to upgrade 75,000 homes every year from 2026 to 2030, with an overall target of 500,000.
EN_035	3	It also targets the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.
EN_035	4	According to Environment Minister Eamon Ryan's figures last month, almost 49,700 applications for heating upgrade support were submitted to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2022, a 150% increase on 2021 figures.
EN_035	5	"""Around 27,700 home energy upgrades were supported in 2022, exceeding the target of 26,940."
EN_035	6	"This represents a 79% increase in outputs year on year,"" he said."
EN_035	7	The Government announced its €8bn National Retrofitting Scheme a year ago, aiming to upgrade 75,000 homes every year from 2026 to 2030, with an overall target of 500,000 Picture: iStock.
EN_035	8	A target of 37,000 retrofits has been set for 2023, he added.
EN_035	9	"The nature of various schemes has been criticised anecdotally by would-be consumers as unwieldy and head-scratching at times, while TDs and senators have told Mr Ryan and SEAI officials at various Oireachtas hearings that there are not enough firms under the SEAI's ""one-stop shop"" model to cope with the demand."
EN_035	10	Mr Ryan told the Irish Examiner last month that the current low number of one-stop shops assigned by the SEAI to carry out the retrofitting programme would improve as the national programme gains momentum.
EN_035	11	He said: “They are ramping up, and they’re not small firms — this is the likes of ESB and Scottish and Southern [SSE] — they’re not companies without scaling-up capabilities.
EN_035	12	It does take time.
EN_035	13	“Last year was only the start, it was always a warming-up.
EN_035	14	We have delivered roughly the scale and speed that we expected.
EN_035	15	We will go this year to 37,000 houses being upgraded, and up again the year after that.
EN_035	16	"It’s delivering, the way I see it."""
EN_035	17	Cork City Council's chief executive said the retrofitting process could be made easier.
EN_035	18	"""There are a lot of schemes where we all get a bit bamboozled — if we could streamline it a bit,"" Ms Doherty told an audience of business and academic figures in Cork."
EN_035	19	Renovations and urgent phase-out of fossil fuels are needed to decarbonise heating in Europe, a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) said.
EN_035	20	"The need for retrofitting is now ""urgent"", the EEA said, with about half of the EU’s final energy consumption going on heating."
EN_035	21	Almost 80% of all household energy use relates to space and water heating, with over half of this energy being supplied by mostly gas, it added.
EN_035	22	"""In 2020, residential and industrial heating and cooling demand was only 10% below the average annual level seen from 2005 to 2009, despite the covid-19 pandemic having suppressed industrial activity and an exceptionally mild winter having lowered the heating needs in most of Europe’s buildings."
EN_035	23	"""This indicates sluggish progress in achieving a permanent reduction in heating and cooling needs,"" the report said."
EN_036	1	The strange link between the sterilization of wild horses and mRNA vaccines
EN_036	2	The pharmacological effect of the vaccination does not occur right away, but gradually over a period of 2-6 weeks, similar to the Covid vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, and requires subsequent booster vaccinations. “
EN_036	3	The zona pellucida (ZP) is a glycoprotein membrane that surrounds all mammalian eggs.
EN_036	4	Certain proteins in the membrane serve as the sperm receptor.
EN_036	5	The contraceptive vaccine produced by the SCC uses the ZP from the pig, thus the name porcine zona pellucida (PZP).
EN_036	6	“Briefly, the PZP is produced by a complex process whereby the ZP is removed from the ovum, its glycoproteins extracted, isolated, and converted into a vaccine.
EN_036	7	The vaccine stimulates the target animal to produce antibodies, which attach to its own ZP, thus blocking fertilization and causing contraception.
EN_036	8	“The PZP vaccine is usually given, initially, in a series of 2 vaccinations 2-6 weeks apart and then a booster every 8 months to a year, depending on the species.
EN_036	9	The PZP is emulsified with an adjuvant to stimulate the animal’s immune system.”
EN_036	10	It is extracted from the ovaries of pigs which is used as a source of antigens for immunocontraception.
EN_036	11	Porcine zona pellucida has been used in wildlife contraception since the late 1980s.
EN_036	12	Animals with which PZP has been employed in this context include elephants, wild and/or feral horses, elk and white tailed deer.
EN_036	13	It can be administered to captured animals via a standard syringe or administered to free ranging wildlife with a dart gun.
EN_036	14	The initial contraceptive effect last for approximately one year in horses.
EN_036	15	From animal reproductive health to people?
EN_036	16	Coincidentally, Pfizer’s CEO Dr.
EN_036	17	Albert Bourla, is a trained veterinarian.
EN_036	18	He is a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and holds a PhD in the Biotechnology of Reproduction from the Veterinary School of Aristotle University in Greece.
EN_036	19	He joined Pfizer in 1993 in its former Animal Health Division as technical director of Greece.
EN_036	20	He held positions of increasing responsibility within the Animal Health Division across Europe, before moving to Pfizer’s New York global headquarters in 2001.
EN_036	21	From 2014-16, Bourla served as group president of Pfizer’s global vaccines and oncology.
EN_036	22	“He was instrumental in building a strong and competitive position in oncology and expanding the company’s leadership in vaccines,” according to his
EN_036	23	Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet stated during the second Stop the Shot online conference streamed on August 19 by LifeSiteNews that peer-reviewed scientific research from 2012 and 2018 as well as evidence from whistle-blowers showed that the jabs damaged fertility and pregnancy.
EN_036	24	It was not being reported to the public.
EN_036	25	The vaccine nanoparticles “can pass through the blood-testis barrier, placental barrier, and epithelial barrier, which protect reproductive tissues,” she said.
EN_036	26	Human immune cells are thus “trained to attack” a protein vital to a successful pregnancy, as in the case of PZP.
EN_036	27	Vliet warned that this would lead to “miscarriages, birth defects, and infertility” when taking the jab.
EN_036	28	Dr. Michael Yeadon, a former vice president at Pfizer, has corroborated the claims, saying that the jabs pose a “severe risk” of infertility.
EN_036	29	Yeadon cited scientific research specifically on lipid nanoparticles, found in the shots.
EN_036	30	“Do not take these vaccines,” he warned.
EN_036	31	“There’s a severe risk to your ability to conceive and carry a baby to term.”
EN_036	32	Although the research into nanoparticle toxicity was conducted on animals, Yeadon argued that humans were also mammals and therefore at similar risk.
EN_036	33	“If someone wants to persuade me that they’re not concentrating in human ovaries, they are going to have to provide me with some data,” he said.
EN_036	34	The jab has also been correlated with thousands of reports of menstrual irregularities .
EN_036	35	Gynecologist Christiane Northrup warned in April this year that the Covid vaccine could cause infertility in women, because the protein Syncytin-1 present in the placenta was very similar to the Covid virus SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein.
EN_039	1	Bill Maher Is Right: It's The Left That Has Gotten More Radical
EN_039	2	Submitted by QTR's Fringe Finance
EN_039	3	The left is increasingly growing angry with Bill Maher for the comedian’s accurate, common sense take that Covid has become a hysteria in the country.
EN_039	4	For Bill, it’s a case of “better late than never” - he certainly wasn’t around criticizing the hysteria a year ago, as Adam Corolla pointed out this weekend: But hey, at least we know he has a learning curve On his show last week, Maher stunned many on the left by publicly reading off facts that are inconvenient to those pushing the Covid hysteria narrative.
EN_039	5	“I asked for the COVID deaths by state, this is per 100,000 people,” Maher said, according to The Daily Wire .
EN_039	6	“The worst is Mississippi.
EN_039	7	My home state New Jersey, four, fourth worst.
EN_039	8	New York, sixth worst.
EN_039	9	West Virginia and Massachusetts are 10 and 11, right together.
EN_039	10	Could there be two states who are more unalike than West Virginia and Massachusetts?
EN_039	11	And the poster boy for keeping s*** open was Florida, they’re down at 17.
EN_039	12	So New York and New Jersey did worse than Florida.
EN_039	13	He continued: “Florida is home to all the old people in America.
EN_039	14	What this is saying - Florida, like, stayed open.
EN_039	15	I mean, I was just in Florida.
EN_039	16	I’ve been there a few times since this started.
EN_039	17	The atmosphere is just different.
EN_039	18	I’m not moving to Florida, I’m not promoting Florida.
EN_039	19	I’m just saying AOC just went to Florida and had a good time without a mask.
EN_039	20	In fact, in proving that most of the right just seeks out common sense, Maher has said that “he’s become a ‘hero’ at Fox News because he’s willing to call out progressive leftists, who he says ‘have their head up their ass,’” according to Maher then accurately stated that it is the left that has changed, not him.
EN_039	21	“Let’s get this straight.
EN_039	22	It’s not me who changed — it’s the left, who is now made up of a small contingent who’ve gone mental, and a large contingent who refuse to call them out for it.
EN_039	23	But I will.
EN_039	24	That’s why I’m a hero at Fox these days.
EN_039	25	Which shows just how much liberals have their head up their a--, because if they really thought about it, they would have made me a hero on their media.”
EN_039	26	Today’s blog post has been published without a paywall because I believe the content to be far too important to deny to anyone.
EN_039	27	However, if you have the means and would like to support my work by subscribing, I’d be happy to offer you 22% off for 2022: And you know Maher is really onto something because he prompted this indignant meltdown by Whoopi Goldberg, who, by the end of her exasperated diatribe, doesn’t really even seem to remember what she was complaining about in the first place.
EN_039	28	Goldberg even places special emphasis on children, either knowingly or unknowingly trying to shoehorn her argument in, in favor of “the kids”, who are disproportionately not affected by Covid.
EN_039	29	But the facts, relative to the hysteria, once again don’t hold water.
EN_039	30	No one wants to trivialize the death of children, but the fact of the matter is that this hysteria we are trying to blanket 350 million Americans with is unwarranted.
EN_039	31	In 2018, by the CDC (I wonder why), almost 2,700 kids aged 1-14 (not 18) died of “unintentional injuries” .
EN_039	32	About 640 died from homicide and about 240 died from influenza and pneumonia .
EN_039	33	Another 6,800 people between the age of 10-24 died from suicide.
EN_039	34	Meanwhile, the American Academy of Pediatrics has said this year between 0.00%-0.02% of all child COVID-19 cases have resulted in death.
EN_039	35	That means that 99.98% to 100% of all child COVID-19 cases do not result in death.
EN_039	36	Throughout the entire pandemic - the millions and millions of cases logged over the course of almost two years, not one - 789 total children since the beginning of 2020 (and this counts up to 18 years old) have been counted as Covid deaths.
EN_056	1	Hungarian and Italian right-wing joined by love of European freedom, says Giorgia Meloni
EN_056	2	With Prime Minister Viktor Orbán we share the same views regarding the future and mission of Europe, which are also represented by the Oct. 23 national holiday, Fratelli d’Italia leader Giorgia Meloni told national news agency MTI on Thursday.
EN_056	3	“Together with Viktor Orbán, we believe that we need brave peoples like Hungary’s 1956 heroes fighting for freedom, who remind Europe of its true identity, because that is the only way to build a future,” Meloni said.
EN_056	4	She was attending the awarding of Pier Francesco Pingitore, the author of the Italian song “Avanti ragazzi di Buda”, which translates to “Go, boys of Buda”.
EN_056	5	The song, which became the anthem of the Italian right, was born in 1966, on the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution.
EN_056	6	Pingitore was awarded the Officer’s Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit.
EN_056	7	The song has also become the unofficial anthem of the SS Lazio football team and the Italian right.
EN_056	8	“I always feel at home among Hungarians, not only because of the national flag of the same color and strong historical ties, but also because with Viktor Orbán we see the perspectives and mission of Europe in the same way, and this is included in the Hungarian national holiday on October 23rd,” Meloni said.
EN_056	9	She added that the young Italian people had been standing by the Hungarian freedom fighters with heart and soul for generations knowing that “the Hungarians had made sacrifices for the whole of Europe.
EN_056	10	The Europe that has been created through so many struggles to protect borders, to secure Europe’s roots, its identity, its values, must continue to prevail today,” Meloni added.
EN_056	11	“Today’s Europe, on the other hand, wants to be supranational sovereignty by restricting the freedom of its member states.
EN_056	12	That is why I think it is completely natural for the peoples of Europe to react when they want to shake that yoke off,” she said.
EN_056	13	Speaking earlier in the Italian Parliament, she said to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte that Italy, as a vassal, was unable to defend itself, its independence, its freedom, its strategic interests, while other “less powerful nations like Hungary and Poland were raising their heads”.
EN_056	14	Giorgia Meloni called it unacceptable that the EU “blackmails” through its rule of law procedure Budapest and Warsaw, which protect their borders, roots and identity, attempting to deprive them of the resources of the Economic Recovery Fund.
EN_056	15	She once again thanked Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who congratulated Meloni on her election as head of the European Conservatives and Reformists.
EN_056	16	“Together with Viktor Orbán, we believe that Europe needs brave peoples, reminding us that Europe is not Maastricht, not the Stability Pact, not all those oppressive bureaucracies, but a civilization to be defended because that is the only way to build a future,” Meloni said.
EN_056	17	She also recalled that the audience greeted Orbán completely spontaneously by singing “Avanti ragazzi di Buda” when he attended the right-wing meeting called Atreju in Rome last September.

EN_066	1	Russia Insists Embassy Staff Have Not Been Evacuated From Ukraine Amid Invasion Fears
EN_066	2	Russia has rejected a report that Moscow withdrew diplomatic staff from missions in Ukraine before international talks over a build up of Russian troops by Ukraine, as concerns grow over President Vladimir Putin 's intentions towards his neighbor.
EN_066	3	Citing an unnamed senior Ukrainian security official, The New York Times (NYT) reported that on January 5, 18 people mostly from the families of Russian diplomats, had departed Kyiv and returned to Russia by bus.
EN_066	4	Over the following days, 30 more staff reportedly followed, some of whom returned from the Russian consulate in Lviv, in western Ukraine, the NYT reported.
EN_066	5	"Last week, talks in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna between NATO , American and Russian officials over Moscow's military presence by Ukraine However, in a statement to Russian news agencies, Russia's foreign ministry dismissed the NYT 's claims, insisting that the Kyiv embassy was ""operating normally."""
EN_066	6	Moscow's statement, which made no mention of its consulate in Lviv, is unlikely to ease tensions amid reports that train convoys with tanks, missiles and troops are pushing west through Russia.
EN_066	7	The significance of the alleged thinning down embassy staff is unclear.
EN_066	8	It could send a message over the seriousness of Moscow's demands for a guarantee Ukraine never joins the alliance.
EN_066	9	It could also suggest an imminent attack was possible, which has been the message coming out of Washington, D.C. and other capitals.
EN_066	10	"Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said U.S. intelligence is pointing to Russia staging a ""false flag"" attack as a pretext for an invasion , which Moscow has repeatedly said will not happen."

EN_067	1	Russian Military Mercenaries Deployed to Venezuela
EN_067	2	As Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro faces the biggest challenge to his rule since coming to power in 2013, Russia has quite literally come to the strongman leader’s defense.
EN_067	3	On Friday, Reuters reported that Kremlin-linked military contractors from the Wagner group had traveled to Venezuela in the past several days to provide security for Maduro.
EN_067	4	At least one source told Reuters that there were around 400 Russian military contractors in the country.
EN_067	5	After the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Juan Guaido, declared himself president of Venezuela on Wednesday, Russian officials have offered their full-throated support for the embattled Maduro.
EN_067	6	President Donald Trump and other leaders from the European Union and Canada, however, have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president and have backed the position of Venezuelan opposition leaders who say Maduro’s presidency is illegitimate.
EN_067	7	Maduro’s approval rating is currently hovering at around 20 percent, but experts say Russia is unlikely to give up its support for Maduro even if he faces widespread opposition at home.
EN_067	8	Moscow has continued to support Maduro even as he oversaw a severe economic decline that provoked a humanitarian and regional refugee crisis.
EN_067	9	“As the financial situation of the Venezuelan government became precarious due to a lack of oil profits, the Venezuelan leaders have been forced to look to other countries to bring in hard currency, and Russia has been all too eager to support a regime in Caracas that is anti-United States and has taken a number of actions to threaten the interests of not just the U.S. but other countries in the region,” Jason Marczak, director of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Washington, D.C.
EN_067	10	-based Atlantic Council, told Newsweek.

EN_067	14	“Russia has gained a strong ally in the Americas as Russia looks to counter the U.S.
EN_067	15	Also Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, so Rosneft has acquired access to oil fields in Venezuela, and Russia supplies arms to Maduro and the military,” Marczak added.
EN_067	16	Russia has also helped Venezuela develop a cryptocurrency to avoid U.S. sanctions.
EN_067	17	Maduro announced in February last year that Venezuela would launch an online currency called the petro, which would be backed by the value of one barrel of oil.
EN_067	18	The move mimicked Moscow’s attempt to launch its own digital currency to avoid U.S. sanctions.
EN_067	19	The petro was widely deemed a desperate and risky attempt to attract foreign currency to the cash-strapped country.
EN_067	20	Meanwhile, other Russia-aligned countries such as China and Turkey have also thrown their weight behind Maduro.
EN_067	21	Researchers at the Atlantic Council who track disinformation online noted that some of the most prominent pro-Maduro Twitter hashtags originated out of Turkey.
EN_067	22	The Russian military contractor group Wagner is a secretive organization headed by a Russian lieutenant named Dmitri Utkin who is a member of the Russian military intelligence the GRU.
EN_067	23	The group has been linked to the death of three Russian journalists who were producing a documentary about Wagner’s work in the Central African Republic.
EN_067	24	Aside from its incursions into Africa, Wagner is also present in Syria and Ukraine.
EN_067	25	Russian media claims that Wagner is coordinated by Yevgeniy Prigozhin , a man who has been nicknamed “Putin’s chef.”
EN_067	26	Prigozhin allegedly ordered the Russian mercenaries to attack U.S. troops in Syria in February 2018.
EN_067	27	Special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Prigozhin, alleging that his St.
EN_067	28	Petersburg-based troll farm the Internet Research Agency played a major role in Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.

EN_069	1	Fox News Commentators Blame Barack Obama For Tensions With Iran
EN_069	2	Fox News commentators and GOP lawmakers appearing on the network have blamed President Barack Obama for the current confrontation with Iran, despite the dramatic escalation in tensions since President Donald Trump took office.
EN_069	3	"A panel on right-wing opinion host Sean Hannity's Tuesday evening show blasted Obama's ""appeasement"" of Iran, arguing that it was ""obvious"" that strategy did not work."
EN_069	4	Commentators on the network, including Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, also argued that the former president's policies were the reason why tensions were
EN_069	5	Pete Hegseth, a fellow panelist and Fox News contributor, agreed, suggesting an even stronger retaliation should come from Washington.
EN_069	6	"Fox News host Brian Kilmeade said, ""The president has played this spot-on thus far, totally reversing the appeasement policies of the Obama administration."""
EN_069	7	"""Where we are right now is on Barack Obama,"" he claimed."
EN_069	8	Hegseth repeated his criticism of Obama on Wednesday morning during a segment of the Fox News morning show Fox & Friends.
EN_069	9	"""Listen, this instant, this moment right now, is on Barack Obama, not Donald Trump,"" he said."
EN_069	10	Appearing on Fox News on Tuesday evening, Cruz lobbed similar accusations against Obama.
EN_069	11	"""In a very real sense, the missiles that we saw fired on U.S. servicemen and women tonight were paid for by the billions the Obama administration flooded the Ayatollah with,"" he argued, referred to Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader."
EN_069	12	"When Fox & Friends played the clip of Cruz's remarks during a segment with Kinzinger on Wednesday morning, the congressman said Cruz was ""100 percent right."""
EN_069	13	He then went on to attack the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, which was signed by the Obama administration.
EN_069	14	Newsweek has reached out to Obama's press office for comment but did not hear back before publication.
EN_069	15	In reality, tensions between Tehran and Washington had de-escalated significantly in the final years of Obama's presidency.
EN_069	16	The JCPOA, which was also signed by the European Union, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China, offered Iran sanctions relief and international investment in exchange for curbing its nuclear program.
EN_069	17	Consistent reports from the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran was in compliance with the agreement, but Trump had long criticized Obama and the international accord.
EN_069	18	In May 2018, the president decided to withdraw from the deal and reimplement sanctions against the Islamic Republic, a move that was condemned by the deal's other signatories.
EN_069	19	Despite Trump's decision, Iran worked with European leaders as well as Russia and China to preserve the deal until May 2019, one year after Trump had announced the U.S. withdrawal.
EN_069	20	Tehran then announced it would begin taking steps back from its commitment under the agreement, in hopes of exerting pressure on the U.S. to return to it.
EN_069	21	But with Trump's decision to kill Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian general who commanded the country's elite Quds Force, as he arrived in Iraq last week, Iran announced that it would no longer abide by any of its commitments under the JCPOA.
EN_069	22	"Vowing "" revenge "" for the killing of the military leader, Iran carried out the missile strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq on Tuesday night."
EN_069	23	There have been no initial reports of U.S. casualties from the attack.
EN_069	24	Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has suggested that his nation does not plan to carry out any more attacks against U.S. interests, saying that the response to Soleimani's killing had been proportional.
EN_069	25	"But Khamenei said that the military strikes were ""not enough."""
EN_069	26	Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has offered a starkly different narrative to that of Kinzinger and Cruz.
EN_069	27	In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning, he argued that the situation with Iran had been improving under the nuclear deal.
EN_069	28	"""I hate this."
EN_069	29	I hate that this is where we are going....
EN_069	30	"There was much less killing, much less violence after the Iran agreement,"" he said."
EN_069	31	"Under the nuclear deal, ""we were heading to a much more stable situation with Iran,"" the senator said."
EN_069	32	"""And now it's gone, and I think it might be gone for a lifetime."""

EN_073	2	"Over Cost of 'Bad Faith' Policy on Taiwan The Chinese government has accused the United States of acting in ""bad faith"" for continuing to back Taiwan, after senior American officials continued to draw relevant lessons for Asia from Russia's protracted war in Ukraine."
EN_073	3	Adm. Michael Gilday, the U.S. Navy's chief of naval operations, endorsed a strategy of deterrence by denial.
EN_073	4	He told a think tank event on Tuesday that Taipei, like Kyiv, could put up a credible defense by acquiring the right types of weapons.
EN_073	5	"""That is a big lesson learned and a wakeup call, particularly with respect to not only having the right kit, but are people trained to use it the right way?"""
EN_073	6	said Gilday, who appeared next to top uniformed officers from the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and Space Force.
EN_073	7	"""That shouldn't be lost on us with respect to Taiwan,"" he said at the forum hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations."
EN_073	8	Earlier, Gen. Charles Brown, the Air Force chief of staff, said a conflict in Asia would pose its own unique geographic challenges to U.S. forces in the Pacific:
EN_073	9	"""You're not going to get in there quickly or easily after the bullets begin to fly."""
EN_073	10	"Ukraine's resistance has shown ""the will of the smaller nation to fight"" will also be a factor, said Brown."
EN_073	11	"China, which maintains a decades-long claim to Taiwan despite having never governed the democratic island, said on Wednesday that it ""firmly opposes"" the U.S. officials' remarks, which China described as interference in its internal affairs."
EN_073	12	"Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, went on to accuse the U.S. of contradicting itself by ""recognizing Taiwan is a part of China on the one hand, but on the other hand playing up the threat of the mainland's invasion of Taiwan."""
EN_073	13	"""Acting in bad faith will not only harm one's image, but will also incur a corresponding cost,"" Wang said at a regular press conference in Beijing on Wednesday."
EN_073	14	"The official said it called into question the seriousness and validity of U.S. commitments to its ""one China"" policy."
EN_073	15	Wang's remarks appeared to be an intentional misreading of the U.S.
EN_073	16	"""one China"" policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole legal government of China, but only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China."
EN_073	17	"Officially, Washington ""takes no position on sovereignty over Taiwan,"" a State Department spokesperson told Newsweek last month, ""only that cross-strait issues are resolved peacefully according to the will and best interests of the people on Taiwan."""
EN_073	18	"Wang also protested the State Department's recent decision to remove select language from its website's "" fact sheet "" about Taiwan, including a line that clarified the U.S. doesn't support Taiwan's independence."
EN_073	19	Ned Price, the department's spokesperson, said the changes didn't indicate a shift in U.S. policy on Taiwan.
EN_073	20	However, his comments suggested the update may have been a response to frequent misinterpretations by Beijing.
EN_073	21	"""I think we care most about ensuring that our relationships around the world are reflected accurately in our fact sheets."
EN_073	22	"I don't think we're as concerned as to what other countries might latch onto in an effort to create a pretense,"" Price said at a May 10 press briefing."
EN_074	1	Kinsale's 'forgotten local heroes' commemorated in ceremony to mark handover of Cork barracks
EN_074	2	The symbolic significance of the handover of a long-held British barracks in a strategic Cork town to the fledgling Irish state a century ago was recalled at a commemorative ceremony on Monday.
EN_074	3	The forgotten local heroes of the War of Independence period in Kinsale were also honoured and parallels were drawn between Ireland's struggle for independence and the war in Ukraine during the event at Charles Fort in Kinsale to commemorate the centenary of the 1922 handover by the crown forces to the Irish provisional government of two British barracks in the town, which had for centuries been a key strategic location in the British empire.
EN_074	4	"“Easter Monday is a time associated with the birth of the Irish state,"" chairperson of Kinsale Commemoration Committee, JJ Hurley, said."
EN_074	5	We value the democracy and freedom that was born out of those events 100 years ago and today, our friends in Ukraine are fighting for those same values.
EN_074	6	It is fitting that we show our support.
EN_074	7	The British surrendered its two military barracks in Kinsale on February 19, 1922 - one on the town’s Barrack Hill, where the ceremonial handover occurred but which is now the site of a supermarket, and Charles Fort, where the handover occurred with little or no ceremony.
EN_074	8	Monday’s commemoration, delayed by Covid, was held at Charles Fort and attended by Minister of State at the OPW, Patrick O’Donovan, the mayor of Cork County, Cllr Gillian Coughlan, and featured music and a re-enactment of the handover.
EN_074	9	Ms Coughlan said Kinsale had for centuries been a key strategic location for the British empire, which had poured tens of thousands of pounds into the construction and manning of defensive forts and barracks in the area.

EN_074	12	“And yet through the revolutionary process, and the bravery and idealism of young men and women of the revolutionary period, the British were forced to withdraw from that key imperialistic bastion in 1922, by that desire for national self-determination, by that fight for freedom,” she said.
EN_074	13	“And while the Treaty might not have been palatable all round, it was the instrument which allowed for the handover of the British military barracks in Kinsale.
EN_074	14	“It was a very symbolic moment when the British military withdrew from the town after centuries.
EN_074	15	It is important that we recognise this important step in the progression towards nationhood.”

EN_075	1	Putin says Russia's interests and security 'non-negotiable'
EN_075	2	RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR Putin today said that Moscow was ready to look for “diplomatic solutions” amid raging tensions with the West over Ukraine but stressed that the country’s interests were non-negotiable.
EN_075	3	“Our country is always open for direct and honest dialogue, for the search for diplomatic solutions to the most complex problems,” Putin said in a video address to mark the Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday in Russia.
EN_075	4	But he added: “The interests of Russia, the security of our citizens, are non-negotiable for us.”
EN_075	5	Putin spoke after parliament’s upper house, the Federation Council, gave him unanimous approval to deploy “peacekeepers” to two breakaway Ukrainian regions now recognised by Moscow as independent, and potentially into other parts of Ukraine.
EN_075	6	In the video address, Putin congratulated the country’s men and said he was certain of the “professionalism” of the Russian military and that they will stand up for the country’s national interests.
EN_075	7	He praised the battle-readiness of the Russian army and said the country would continue to develop state-of-the-art weapons.
EN_075	8	“We will continue to develop advanced weapon systems, including hypersonic and those based on new physical principles, and expand the use of advanced digital technologies and elements of artificial intelligence,” the Kremlin strongman added.
EN_075	9	“Such complexes are truly the weapons of the future, which significantly increase the combat potential of our armed forces.”
EN_075	10	Western officials have been warning for weeks the Russian leader has been preparing an all-out invasion of Ukraine.
EN_075	11	The US-led sanctions will “hurt the global financial and energy markets,” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, said in a Facebook post, adding that ordinary Americans will “feel the full consequences of rising prices.”
EN_075	12	Sanctions.
EN_075	13	Yesterday US President Joe Biden announced tough new sanctions against Russia for “beginning” an invasion of Ukraine but said there was still time to avoid war.
EN_075	14	Japan and Australia followed suit today with their own stringent penalties for Moscow and individuals connected with the aggression against Ukraine, with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison targeting members of Russia’s security council for “behaving like thugs and bullies.”
EN_075	15	Biden announced what he called the “first tranche” of sanctions, including steps to starve Russia of financing and target financial institutions and the country’s “elites.”
EN_075	16	But he left the door open to a final effort at diplomacy to avert a full-scale Russian invasion.
EN_075	17	Biden’s address followed a wave of sanctions announced by the European Union and UK, after Putin recognised the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk rebel republics.
EN_075	18	Germany also announced it was halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
EN_075	19	But Moscow said the sanctions regime would backfire.
EN_075	20	The US-led sanctions will “hurt the global financial and energy markets,” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, said in a Facebook post, adding that ordinary Americans will “feel the full consequences of rising prices.”
EN_075	21	The Russian Ambassador to Ireland said that sanctions against Russia will cause a knock-on impact on EU member states.
EN_075	22	Speaking to The Journal, Yury Filatov said that any move to impose sanctions on Russia would cause a destabilisation of the economy across EU member states.

EN_084	8	“I think, in the Irish context, where I see the discussion going is that the EU will, of course, increase its defence and security capabilities… because Ireland is so EU positive, and you’re part of the EU.
EN_084	9	For that kind of cooperation, there will be an impact in the way you [are active] – you have been active but you will need to be more active in the EU level,” she said.
EN_084	10	The ambassador said that Ireland is not in isolation from the threat of Russian aggression.
EN_084	11	She particularly noted the problem of cyber security and said that the threat of hybrid warfare, complete with attacks on major infrastructure, has come true for Ireland with the HSE ransomware incident.
EN_084	12	Lahnalampi believes that a key area where Finland and Ireland have liaised in the past is in cyber security.
EN_084	13	She believes that both countries are in the “same boat”, having suffered and then improved cyber defences following Russian attacks.
EN_084	14	Lahnalampi believes that Ireland will have no option but to join with other nations in a trans-European security apparatus.
EN_084	15	“I think, as we see it in Finland, it is that the whole security environment, security structure for Europe, if not globally, has changed,” she said.
EN_084	16	“Russia is breaking international law, humanitarian law, human rights law.
EN_084	17	And in that sense, the big picture is exactly the same for Ireland and Finland, in particular, that none of us is militarily non-aligned [so] I would say that we are not alone – we don’t belong to a military alliance,” she explained.
EN_084	18	But Finland, she said, diverges on the NATO membership debate and she feels that it is almost inevitable that her country will join the alliance.
EN_095	1	Macron faces fresh challenge as massive strike looms in France
EN_095	2	Trains cancelled, schools closed: France scrambled to make contingency plans on Tuesday for a huge strike against pension overhauls that poses one of the biggest challenges yet to President Emmanuel Macron's sweeping reform drive.
EN_095	3	Paris metro and rail workers will walk off the job starting Thursday, banking on widespread support for their protest against plans they say will require millions to retire later or face reduced pensions.
EN_095	4	"It is the latest expression of discontent by broad swathes of French society, from police and firefighters to teachers and hospital employees -- as well as a yearlong ""yellow vest"" movement demanding improved living standards."
EN_095	5	Looming over the reform is the spectre of 1995, the last major attempt to change the pension system when weeks of strikes paralysed the country and forced the government to back down.
EN_095	6	"""The social discontent now is stronger than it was in 1995,"" according to Bernard Thibault, a former CGT leader during the protests 24 years ago."
EN_095	7	Bike shops have been inundated with rental requests, ride-hailing services are planning to add drivers and electric scooter operators are offering special deals to help commuters cope with the expected traffic jams. - 'Provocation' - So far, Macron has been able to ride out opposition to previous signature reforms, including less-restrictive labour laws and tax cuts to encourage hiring and overhauls of the education system.
EN_095	8	He even pushed through changes to the state-run rail operator SNCF, long considered an untouchable union bastion, ending job-for-life guarantees and other benefits for new employees.
EN_095	9	"Those successes have only fired up union leaders, who have vowed to maintain their strike until Macron abandons his campaign promise for a ""universal"" retirement system."
EN_095	10	"It would do away with 42 ""special regimes"" for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera employees, which often grant workers higher pensions or early retirement."
EN_095	11	But unions say the changes would effectively require millions of private-sector workers to work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 if they want to receive the full pension they have been promised.
EN_095	12	"""The flagrant provocation is trying to say this reform would affect only the special schemes,"" Philippe Martinez of the hard-line CGT union said last week."
EN_095	13	"""It's a shameful lie,"" he continued."
EN_095	14	"""Everyone understands that it's a reform that will affect the public as well as the private sector."" - 'Quite harmful' - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has acknowledged that French workers will gradually work longer but no concrete details of the overhaul are to be announced before mid-December."
EN_095	15	And while 76 percent of respondents in an Ifop poll published on Sunday back the reform, 64 percent do not trust the government to pull it off.
EN_095	16	Police unions, rubbish collectors, air-traffic controllers and Air France workers have said they will start striking on Thursday, and the biggest union for primary school teachers expects four out of 10 schools will remain shut.
EN_095	17	The SNCF and Paris metro operator RATP will announce at 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) on Tuesday the likely number of service cuts, expected to match a similar protest on September 13, when most Paris lines were shut down completely.
EN_095	18	Rallies and work stoppages are planned in dozens of cities, capped by two demonstrations planned for Paris that will converge on the Place de la Nation.
EN_095	19	Officials have already ordered Paris businesses along the routes to close on Thursday, underscoring retailers' fears that a long strike will take a heavy toll on their businesses.
EN_095	20	"""It's a period of heavy spending,"" Francois Asselin, president of the CPME association of small and midsize businesses, told France Info radio on Tuesday."
EN_095	21	"""We estimate that a day of general strikes takes away some 400 million euros ($440 million) of revenues for the country, including nearly 200 million euros for the Paris region,"" he said."
EN_095	22	"And if the strike persists, he warned, ""it can frankly be quite harmful, especially with Christmas coming up""."
EN_101	1	New Jersey UFO Sighting Turns Out to Be Goodyear Blimp
EN_101	2	New Jersey residents were convinced a flying saucer was hovering over their state on Monday, with footage of the supposed extra-terrestrial incident going viral on social media.
EN_101	3	However, thankfully it is unlikely that aliens are planning any abductions over the East Coast, as the UFO was just a Goodyear blimp.
EN_101	4	"TikTok user @.babyjennie shared a video of what appeared to be a flying saucer in the distance and captioned the video: ""Who else saw the UFO today in Jersey on 21?"
EN_101	5	"People were dead stopped on the highway recording."""
EN_101	6	The TikTok video has more than half a million likes.
EN_101	7	"A Twitter user shared a video with footage of the ""UFO"" film from a car before the driver pulls over for a better look, and said: ""I still can't believe a UFO was spotted in New Jersey today!"""
EN_101	8	In a video that has been viewed more than 300,000 times on Twitter, people can be seen standing on the side of the highway filming what looked like an alien spaceship.
EN_101	9	The person filming says that the whole street has stopped.
EN_101	10	General view of the Goodyear Blimp during the VRBO Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium on January 1, 2019, in Orlando, Florida.
EN_101	11	New Jersey residents parked along the highway to capture what appeared to be an alien spaceship but was instead a Goodyear blimp that had flown over a game at the MetLife Stadium, on September 15, 2020.
EN_101	12	"Another video posted to Twitter that has been viewed more than 100,000 claims that the ""UFO"" was flying over Teterboro Airport."
EN_101	13	"In the video, the man says: ""This is literally a f****** UFO."
EN_101	14	It's just floating.
EN_101	15	The ship was closer, it went up, a light was like shining from it, like a beam.
EN_101	16	"This s*** is just f****** flat and it was moving in like circles."""
EN_101	17	"In another TikTok video shared to Twitter, a man says: ""Everybody's stopped to see the aliens, that's what everybody's saying."
EN_101	18	"I don't know if that's true or not, but everybody's blocked the highway, saying the are aliens are coming."""
EN_101	19	However, despite the otherworldly nature of the social media footage, the unidentified flying object is not a flying saucer, but a Goodyear blimp.
EN_101	20	Other New Jersey residents, seemingly closer to the object, shared videos that clearly show the UFO's true identity.
EN_101	21	"Twitter user @linobrescia shared a video and said: ""Wingfoot Two straight up just floating backwards...Why?"
EN_101	22	Because he can.
EN_101	23	"BOSS!!!"""
EN_101	24	"Another said: ""The amount of dumb***** in New Jersey who think they saw a f****** UFO, it was a f****** Goodyear blimp."
EN_101	25	"All you had to do was have a high def camera or keep it still enough you can see what's on the side."""
EN_101	26	Others reported that the blimp had flown over the Giants vs Steelers game at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which is just north of Highway 21.
EN_101	27	Newsweek has contacted Goodyear for comment.
EN_112	1	Masked Thugs Attack Activists Occupying a Primeval Forest in Masuria
EN_112	2	A group of environmental activists decided to block logging equipment and vehicles in the Borecka Primeval Forest (Puszcza Borecka) located about 20 km from Giżycko- a popular vacation spot in the Masurian Lake District.
EN_112	3	The activists believe that the logging is too extensive and contributes to the destruction of a unique natural ecosystem.
EN_112	4	The woodcutting is carried out by private timber companies on behalf of the local forestry management.
EN_112	5	"Environmentalists identifying as members of the ""Wild Resistance Movement"" (Dziki Ruch Oporu) decided to take matters into their own hands, and on Monday, blocked two vehicles used to cut and haul away trees."
EN_112	6	They also set up a camp, including hanging tree tents.

EN_112	13	– the activists wrote in their statement posted online.
EN_112	14	Also on Monday, there were two police interventions. - We received a report that activists were obstructing forestry work.
EN_112	15	A patrol unit arrived at the site, but did not conduct any activities- says Iwona Chruścińska, spokeswoman for the Giżycko police.
EN_112	16	Footage recorded by the protesters shows a police officer holding a rope belonging to one of the activists but later abandoning his actions.
EN_112	17	Masked thugs attack activists, then drive off.
EN_112	18	Another intervention took place in the evening, and by then the police had already been called by the activists themselves. - They informed us that their camp had been invaded by a group of people in balaclavas- Ms.
EN_112	19	Chruścińska confirms. - When the patrol unit arrived at the site, the attackers were already gone.
EN_112	20	The activists were supposed to appear at the police station and present evidence, but so far they have not filed a report.

EN_127	1	Job Recruiter Proclaims That Vaccination Status Could Be an 'Incentive for Hiring'
EN_127	2	One of the nation's oldest recruitment services is sharing its perspective on how job seekers' vaccination status could potentially lead to hiring.
EN_127	3	On Wednesday, Owner and President of Babich & Associates Tony Beshara spoke to KTVT about job recruiting and vaccinations.
EN_127	4	"Beshara told the news outlet that most companies with more than 100 employees are ""really mad."""
EN_127	5	"""Companies have been proactive about COVID for self-preservation purposes, but in most organizations, there's always going to be some people that will be anti-vaxxers and those kinds of people stick their heels in the ground and say, 'I'm not getting vaccinated,'"" said Beshara."
EN_127	6	Beshara stated the hesitancy among certain job seekers puts companies in a difficult spot.
EN_127	7	"""The job market is tough enough and companies are having trouble finding candidates, so they'll take them any way they can get them if they're qualified to do the joband then be concerned about how they're going to deal with it later,"" he explained."

EN_127	14	Established in 1952, Babich & Associates is the oldest job recruitment and placement service in the state of Texas.
EN_127	15	"The news regarding job and vaccination status comes as the Biden Administration announced on September 8 that all federal employees must be vaccinated via his ""Path Out of the Pandemic"" plan or risk losing their jobs."
EN_127	16	Employers with over 100 employees must require their employees to either be fully vaccinated or submit weekly testing results under the new mandate.
EN_127	17	If businesses don't comply, they could face fines of up to $14,000 per violation.
EN_127	18	"Additionally, ""employees of contractors that do business with the federal government"" must also be vaccinated, according to the plan."
EN_127	19	According to data collected from the U.S. Census Bureau, a total of 98.1 percent of companies in the U.S. employ fewer than 100 people, while companies with less than than 10 employees account for 8.4 percent.

EN_128	1	New Jersey Governor's Race Could Slip Into Recount Margin, GOP Candidate's Lawyer Says
EN_128	2	While New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy continues to lead Republican Jack Ciattarelli in votes for the gubernatorial race, Ciattarelli's lawyer said the margin between the two candidates could narrow enough to warrant a recount, the Associated Press reported.
EN_128	3	The AP declared Murphy as winner last week and other sources project a final victory by tens of thousands of votes, but Ciattarelli has so far declined to concede to the incumbent governor.
EN_128	4	Though Murphy only led the race by less than a percentage point last week, his margin grew to about 2.6 points on Monday.
EN_128	5	That equates to a roughly 65,000-vote lead for Murphy, the AP reported.
EN_128	6	Ciattarelli's campaign estimates that roughly 70,000 provisional votes, or ballots only counted after election officials confirm that the voter hasn't cast another ballot, remain uncounted.
EN_128	7	It is unknown how many mail-in ballots also remain uncounted.
EN_128	8	"Mark Sheridan, legal counsel for Ciattarelli, said in a statement that while the Republican's campaign doesn't expect to pass Murphy in the provisional vote count, ""that count may reduce the margin for Governor Murphy enough to warrant a full recount."""
EN_128	9	"Murphy gave a victory speech on Nov. 3 in Asbury Park, and wrote on his official campaign Twitter account that ""we have made history tonight."""
EN_128	10	"""Tonight, I renew my promise to you -- whether you voted for me or not -- to work every single day of the next four years to keep moving us forward,"" one tweet read."

EN_128	15	Ciattarelli's campaign denied Monday that there was fraud in this year's governor's election.
EN_128	16	"""Let me be clear, no one on this team is alleging fraud or malfeasance, as we have not seen any credible evidence of that,"" Sheridan said in the statement."
EN_128	17	"But Sheridan added that this year's new election law, which in part allowed early in-person voting for the first time, is also contributing to what he called ""excruciatingly slow vote counting."""
EN_128	18	Each of New Jersey's 21 counties are conducting their own count of any mail-in and provisional ballots left to be counted.
EN_128	19	The state Board of Canvassers doesn't meet until Dec. 2 to certify the results.
EN_128	20	Ciattarelli is a former Assembly member who campaigned on a mix of traditional issues, like lowering the state's high property taxes, as well as against COVID-19 mandates.
EN_128	21	Murphy became that first Democrat to win re-election as governor in 44 years.
EN_128	22	He focused principally on the progressive agenda he delivered in his first term, including higher taxes on the wealthy and a boosted minimum wage, among other programs.
EN_128	23	On Monday, Murphy called on Ciattarelli to concede, saying the race was run fairly and transparently.
EN_128	24	He said every vote would be counted.
EN_128	25	"""But when it's mathematically impossible to win, I think it's dangerous."
EN_128	26	I think it's bigger than winning or losing.
EN_128	27	It sort of gets to the question of what it is to be an American and respect for the institutions that we count on as a society, including democracy.
EN_128	28	"This is what America is all about,"" he said."
EN_128	29	Under state law, there is no automatic recount and the party seeking one must file a suit in state Superior Court in each county where they want to request a recount.
EN_128	30	Ciattarelli said last week that it was too early to concede the election or declare victory.
EN_128	31	He also urged supporters not to believe unfounded conspiracies and said the result no matter the outcome would be fair.
EN_128	32	Murphy's victory was a bright spot for Democrats nationally, though the party lost the Virginia governor's race even after President Joe Biden carried the state by double digits in last year's election against Despite Murphy's win, Republicans had an unexpected and important victory in the Legislature, defeating Senate President Steve Sweeney and stunning officials across the state.
EN_128	33	Phil Murphy was the first Democratic governor of New Jersey to win re-election in more than four decades.
EN_129	1	Cork Life Centre ‘deeply disappointed’ with review of out-of-school education system
EN_129	2	The Cork Life Centre has said it is “deeply disappointed and concerned” with the recently published review of out-of-school education, saying its recommendations would “consign to the scrap heap those children who cannot cope with the traditional institutionalised school system”.
EN_129	3	The Review of Out-of-School Education Provision was published on May 12, with Minister for Education, Norma Foley , announcing that a group would be set up to oversee implementation of its recommendations, which include a standardised referral framework and better data recording and tracking of students who are expelled or absent from school.
EN_129	4	The Cork Life Centre was one of 23 organisations delivering out-of-school education that contributed to the review, but it claimed the report contained factual “inaccuracies”, and queried why it was only being published now when it was understood to have been completed in 2019.
EN_129	5	The Cork Life Centre focuses on long-term intervention for 12- to 16-year-olds.
EN_129	6	Picture: Howard Crowdy.
EN_129	7	“It is an understatement to say that the report has been received with disappointment and frustration by the board, management, and staff of the Cork Life Centre,” it said of the report.
EN_129	8	“Our view is that it is shaping the problem to fit the system, when in fact it should be the other way around.
EN_129	9	“The review's recommendations focus on short-term interventions and do not include provision of education to children after the age of 16 or delivery of the Leaving Certificate.”
EN_129	10	Given that Cork Life Centre and others run a service based on long-term intervention for 12- to 18-year-olds and delivers the Leaving Certificate to approximately 12 students per annum, it added “it seems very unclear how this review will progress proper funding of our service in Cork”.
EN_129	11	As for that cut-off age of 16, it said: “This is a hammer blow for anyone outside the mainstream school system with an aspiration of completing the Leaving Certificate.
EN_129	12	The report is looking to consign to the scrap heap, those children who cannot cope with the traditional institutionalised school system.
EN_129	13	“It does not address the input and needs of students who find themselves outside the mainstream system.
EN_129	14	"""The report minimises, undermines, and misrepresents the achievements of students in out-of-school provision at Leaving Certificate level.”"
EN_129	15	It also described as an “egregious misrepresentation” the claim in the report that “the Leaving Cert was not as prominent in the data returned”, outlining how 28 students achieved the Leaving Certificate in the three years from 2014 to 2017 at the Cork Life Centre.
EN_129	16	Earlier this month, Minister Foley had said: “While this review finds positively on the work which is carried out in out-of-school settings, it is important to provide stability to this provision and ensure settings are sustainable into the future.”
EN_132	1	Governments and consumers will end up paying for large amounts of expensive European gas stored over winter as wholesale prices plunge Prices have dropped by more than 80% from their August peak, meaning sales from inventories could come at a loss of billions of euros to energy users and taxpayers.
EN_132	2	“Traders inject during summer believing that prices will be higher in winter, but that just didn’t happen,” said Sindre Knutsson, vice president at Rystad Energy.
EN_132	3	“At the end, it is the consumer paying for all this.”
EN_132	4	In a sense, Europe is a victim of its own success.
EN_132	5	The region rushed to import liquefied natural gas as Russia curbed pipeline supplies in the fallout over its invasion of Ukraine.
EN_132	6	Mild weather has also kept a lid on heating demand, helping to ease a historic energy crisis.
EN_132	7	Regional inventories are currently about 65% full on average, much higher than usual for the time of year, data from Gas Infrastructure Europe show.
EN_132	8	Stockpiles might even end the winter above 50%, double the level last year, according to several analysts.
EN_132	9	While that’s good for energy security, it creates a dilemma for some entities that bought the fuel at its peak.
EN_132	10	To protect themselves against price volatility, companies can hedge and engage in contracts to buy and sell gas at pre-determined prices.
EN_132	11	Traders and utilities can still take a hit on price differences, though such losses generally aren’t disclosed.
EN_132	12	Some purchases last summer were made by companies using state aid, especially in Germany, the largest consumer.
EN_132	13	That could leave taxpayers exposed if the fuel is sold out of inventory at a loss.
EN_132	14	“They will be losing money on any gas withdrawn from storage now and sold spot,” said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas, coal and carbon at Energy Aspects.
EN_132	15	“This loss is just to be borne by taxpayers rather than shareholders.”
EN_132	16	Germany’s Trading Hub Europe, set up by gas grids to serve as a market manager, had access to €15bn in government support to buy inventories at practically any cost to fill the gap left by Russia.
EN_132	17	The firm was deeply exposed to the spot market and collects charges to cover the costs associated with the task of filling storage.
EN_132	18	“The top priority was filling the gas storage tanks in order to increase security of supply,” a spokesperson for the company said, declining to comment on any potential losses.
EN_132	19	“We bought and sell at current market prices.”
EN_132	20	Soaring market prices last summer, a time of year when gas isn’t used for heating and prices are normally lower than in winter, cost buyers in the European Union dearly.
EN_132	21	The EU’s total gas import bill spiked to a record €101bn in the third quarter, more than triple the level from a year earlier, according to a report from the European Commission.
EN_132	22	Much of that fuel was put into storage.
EN_132	23	Benchmark futures are now trading just above €50, near the lowest levels since September 2021.
EN_132	24	Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that prices are likely to fall further, with stockpiles in key EU members ending the heating season at 59% full on average.
EN_132	25	That could spell more bad news for anyone looking to sell gas from inventories.
EN_132	26	“If buyers did not hedge the volumes they stored last summer, they will try to keep that gas in storage until prices potentially rise next winter or further in the future,” said BloombergNEF analyst Stefan Ulrich.
EN_132	27	However, “it seems unlikely that buyers will be able to recoup their buying costs in full unless the market dramatically tightens”. - Bloomberg.

EN_133	2	“The violence has escalated.
EN_133	3	Antifa members attacked the police officers, who had to write up a protester, who was provoking in Serbian.
EN_133	4	One policeman was kicked in the back,” Nova24TV journalist, Luka Svetina, reported from the Republic Square.
EN_133	5	He also reported that the police officers on horses and Top News journalist Vladimir Vodušek were also attacked.
EN_133	6	At times, Ljubljana looked like an actual war zone, as the hooligans were throwing pyrotechnics, granite cubes and other objects, while also destroying property.
EN_133	7	And worst of all – they injured people, including police officers.
EN_133	8	An illegal protest by the extreme left-wing groups took place on Thursday, at the Republic Square in front of the Maximarket store.
EN_133	9	Criminals, such as Anis Ličina, were also at the protest.
EN_133	10	As is well known, Slovenia, like most other European countries, is in the middle of the worst epidemic, so any and all gatherings are illegal, as there is a high risk of transmission of the COVID-19 coronavirus.
EN_133	11	They announced a collapse The event was being covered by Nova24TV journalist Luka Svetina , who recorded a shocking scene of provocation by a protester who, by the way, did not speak Slovenian.
EN_133	12	Among other things, he said the following In Serbian: “Dana če biti lom,” which roughly translates to “Today, there will be a collapse.”
EN_133	13	The police officers then demanded to see the protester’s personal documents, and just then, a member of the far-left group Antifa attacked one of the police officers from behind and kicked him in the back.
EN_133	14	Police officers then intervened, and the crowd started shouting, so the police used the megaphone to ask them to follow the instructions of the police and not violate public law and order.
EN_133	15	But the violence only escalated, and the action moved closer to Drama.
EN_133	16	According to Svetina, the extremists attacked the police officers on horses, who were only doing their job – ensuring the safety of everyone, with pyrotechnics.
EN_133	17	Representatives of the media were also attacked, one of them was the Top TV journalist Vladimir Vodušek .
EN_133	18	The police helicopter was used to monitor the situation from above, and the perpetrators were then surrounded by police, to prevent them from escaping.
EN_133	19	The Antifa protesters then moved towards Slovenska street, in the direction of the city centre.
EN_133	20	The footage shows continuous cracking of the firecrackers, loud extremists and chaos.
EN_133	21	They caused real havoc, and the police even had to use a water cannon against them.
EN_133	22	Here is the full police report on the event: “Here is the data on today’s protest rally: some 100 people gathered on the Republic Square.
EN_133	23	Around 5 p.m., there was a mass violation of public order and the use of pyrotechnics, which led the police to disband the rally, to ensure public order.
EN_133	24	The persons were repeatedly asked to leave the Republic Square, but they did not follow this order, so the police dispersed the crowd from the Republic Square.
EN_133	25	Individual groups then revolted in the area of the centre of Ljubljana and disobeyed police orders to disperse, some attacks on the police officers also followed, in which the individuals threw granite blocks and other objects at the policemen and used pyrotechnics.

EN_136	1	Wittenberg church to face German Supreme Court over ‘Jew sow’
EN_136	2	The plaintiff is Michael Dietrich Düllmann, a member of the Jewish community in Bonn.
EN_136	3	He is an elderly German who converted to Judaism in the 1970s.
EN_136	4	He has already gone through two instances, but at 78, he is not backing down.
EN_136	5	Düllmann wants to remove the relief from the façade of the main church of the Reformation and have it moved to the Luther House Museum in Wittenberg together with a historical-critical classification.
EN_136	6	After all, this is where Martin Luther wrote his anti-Jewish writings, argued Düllmann.
EN_136	7	“The Wittenberg ‘Jew sow’ has been controversial for some time.
EN_136	8	For this reason, it has been expanded into a ‘Place of Remembrance’ since 1988, and a memorial plaque embedded in the ground refers to the victims of National Socialism.
EN_136	9	In addition, there is an explanatory panel on the relief as well as a cedar from Israel as a “sign of reconciliation”.
EN_136	10	But this is not enough for the convert.
EN_136	11	Plaintiff Düllmann keeps citing new complaints and has also been able to win over other allies in the fight against the unloved pictorial work, such as Friedrich Kramer, Bishop of Central Germany, Klaus Holz, Secretary General of the Protestant Academy, Felix Klein, the Federal Government’s anti-Semitism commissioner.
EN_136	12	However, Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, does not want to join the call for the sculpture’s removal.
EN_136	13	Düllmann is unperturbed by this obstacle.
EN_136	14	He said he eventually wanted to go all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.
EN_136	15	The fight is about to become interesting since the Wittenberg City Church is a World Heritage Site and a listed building.
EN_136	16	Whether the sensitivities of Bonn’s religious community will outweigh these, remains to be seen.
EN_136	17	At least, no such fervour was noted in removing recent Nazi-related insignia in full display in Germany in relation to the war in Ukraine.
EN_136	18	In 2020, a regional court ruled that the artwork could not be touched.
EN_136	19	The Naumburg court argued that the sculpture was part of the ancient building, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and thus could not be disturbed.
EN_136	20	The Wittenberg church was the first church to ever hold a mass in German instead of Latin.
EN_136	21	Martin Luther, the ex-Catholic monk responsible for the Protestant Reformation, lived in Wittenberg and preached at the church.
EN_136	22	Most Lutheran churches in Germany have similar reliefs.
EN_136	23	An estimated 30 churches remain, including the Cologne Cathedral, as well as in Eberswalde and Magdeburg.
EN_136	24	According to the convert, the Wittenberg relief “is a terrible falsification of Judaism […] a defamation and insult to the Jewish people and it has had a terrible effect to this day”.
EN_139	1	'Controversy over rubber bullets isn't new - I watched an RUC officer fire one point blank at Sean Downes'
EN_139	2	AS AMERICA WAS convulsed by protests and violence following the police killing of George Floyd, plastic and rubber bullets were increasingly used by security forces to attack or disperse demonstrators.
EN_139	3	There were many injuries, including of journalists covering the events.
EN_139	4	But controversy over the plastic bullets is hardly new.
EN_139	5	Indeed, for anyone in Northern Ireland who lived through the Troubles, it will be intimately familiar.
EN_139	6	The plastic bullet was an invention of the British security forces, developed in the early 1970s to deal with disorderly crowds, and Northern Ireland became something of a laboratory for their use.
EN_139	7	As a CNN correspondent back then, it was something I witnessed myself.
EN_139	8	On 12 August, 1984, I stood with my camera crew outside Sinn Féin headquarters in West Belfast and watched a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary fire a plastic bullet at point blank range into the chest of demonstrator Sean Downes.
EN_139	9	He died as our camera recorded the scene.
EN_139	10	He was not the first, or the last, victim of a plastic bullet.
EN_139	11	Permanent brain damage.
EN_139	12	Four inches long, one and a half inches in diameter, and weighing five ounces, the plastic bullet had been designed as a less lethal tool for riot control than so-called live bullets, able to deliver a knock-down blow without entering the body.
EN_139	13	Meant to be fired from a distance and below waist level, it was often the weapon of first resort for security forces in breaking up demonstrations or disturbances.
EN_139	14	Fired from close range, however, the plastic bullet was deadly.
EN_139	15	As the horrifying cases piled up – people killed, blinded, suffering skull fractures, permanent brain damage, ruptured kidneys, or severe haemorrhages – the anger and alienation of the North’s Catholic community, which felt itself to be a particular target, grew, exacerbated by the unwillingness of the authorities to deal with the issue.

EN_139	18	In my new book Are You With Me?
EN_139	19	Kevin Boyle and the Rise of the Human Rights Movement , a biography of the late law professor and early leader of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement, I recount Boyle’s involvement in a campaign in the early 1980s to ban plastic bullets.
EN_139	20	It was just one of many cases in which Boyle was ahead of his time.
EN_139	21	A strong advocate of using the law to press for change, he had brought the first individual cases on behalf of people mistreated while being interrogated in detention by the security forces in Northern Ireland to the European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
EN_139	22	He had represented the widow of a man shot and killed by soldiers after they had issued nothing more than a verbal warning to stop.
EN_139	23	He had sought to use the Strasbourg machinery in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to mediate during the 1981 IRA hunger strikes.
EN_139	24	And he was the lead lawyer in the case which led the European Court of Human Rights to decriminalise homosexuality in Northern Ireland.
EN_139	25	Moved by the plight of victims like 15-year-old Derry schoolboy Paul Whitters, who died after being hit in the head by a plastic bullet fired by a policeman, (and whose death was ruled ‘not justified’ in an official inquiry in 2007), Boyle worked with two activist priests in Belfast, Fr Raymond Murray and Fr Denis Faul, to mobilise popular opinion for a ban on plastic bullets, “I don’t exaggerate,” Boyle wrote to a friend, “when I say the issue of plastic bullets and their misuse is an even worse scandal than interrogation was in the early 1970s.
EN_139	26	It isn’t even the deaths and injuries, but the complete lack of response by the authorities.
EN_139	27	Déjà vu might be your feeling when you hear of no prosecutions, inadequate investigations, and so on.
EN_139	28	No one wants to know, basically.”
EN_139	29	Potentially lethal.
EN_139	30	At an international tribunal the two activist priests organised in Belfast, with participants from Britain and the US joining concerned local citizens, Boyle submitted an eight-page paper in which he argued that the policies of the British army and Royal Ulster Constabulary governing the use of plastic bullets raised serious legal questions.
EN_139	31	The paper began by taking issue with the government’s use of the antiseptic-sounding term ‘baton rounds’ to describe the bullets.
EN_139	32	This, he noted, was deliberately being done to portray the plastic bullet as “defensive in nature and restrained in its capacity to cause injury”.
EN_144	1	Two killed as demonstrations around Iran enter fourth week
EN_144	2	In some areas, shops were closed in response to a call by activists for a commercial strike or to protect their wares from damage.
EN_144	3	The protests erupted on September 17, after the burial of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman who had died in the custody of Iran’s feared morality police.
EN_144	4	Ms Amini had been detained for an alleged violation of strict Islamic dress codes for women.
EN_144	5	Since then, protests spread across the country and were met by a fierce crackdown, in which dozens are estimated to have been killed and hundreds arrested.
EN_144	6	In the city of Sanandaj in the Kurdish-majority northern region, one man was shot dead on Saturday while driving a car in a major road, rights monitors said.
EN_144	7	The France-based Kurdistan Human Rights Network and the Hengaw Organisation for Human Rights said the man was shot after honking at security forces stationed on the street.
EN_144	8	Honking has become one of the ways activists have been expressing civil disobedience.
EN_144	9	Video circulating online showed the slain man slumped over the steering wheel, as distraught witnesses shouted for help.
EN_144	10	The semi-official Fars news agency, believed to be close to the elite paramilitary force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, said Kurdistan’s police chief denied reports of using live rounds against protesters.
EN_144	11	President Ebrahim Raisi met students from the all-female Al-Zahra University in Tehran (Iranian Presidency Office via AP/PA) Fars claimed that people in Sanandaj’s Pasdaran Street said the victim was shot from inside the car without elaborating.
EN_144	12	But photos of the dead man indicate that he was shot from his left side, meaning he unlikely to have been shot from inside the car.
EN_144	13	A second protester was killed after security forces fired gunshots to disperse crowds in the city and 10 protesters were wounded, the rights monitors said.
EN_144	14	A general strike was observed in the city’s main streets amid a heavy security presence and protesters burned tyres in some areas.
EN_144	15	Patrols have deterred mass gatherings in Sanandaj but isolated protests have continued in the city’s densely populated neighborhoods.
EN_144	16	Demonstrations were also reported in the capital Tehran on Saturday, including small ones near the Sharif University of Technology, the scene of a violent government crackdown last weekend.
EN_144	17	Authorities have closed the campus until further notice.
EN_144	18	Images on social media showed protests also took place in the northeastern city of Mashhad.
EN_144	19	Other protests erupted at Azad University in northern Tehran, in other neighbourhoods of the capital and in the city’s bazaar.
EN_144	20	Many shops were closed in central Tehran and near the University of Tehran.
EN_144	21	President Ebrahim Raisi in a meeting with students from the all-female Al-Zahra University in Tehran alleged again that foreign enemies were responsible for the protests.
EN_144	22	He has made the claim without giving specifics or providing any evidence.
EN_144	23	“The enemy thought that it can pursue its desires in universities while unaware that our students and teachers are aware and they will not allow the enemies’ vain plans to be realised,” he said.
EN_145	1	Hate crime reports to gardaí rose by 29% last year
EN_145	2	Garda Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman: 'I urge any person who has experienced or observed prejudice to come forward and report those incidents to us.'
EN_145	3	Photograph: Colin Keegan/Collins Dublin.
EN_145	4	The number of reported hate crimes and other hate-related incidents notified to gardaí rose by 29 per cent last year, new figures show.
EN_145	5	Data published by An Garda Síochána on Wednesday reveals there were 582 hate crimes and hate related (non-crime) incidents recorded in 2022.
EN_145	6	The figure was 448 in 2021.
EN_145	7	Almost half (47 per cent) of hate related incidents reported in 2022 occurred in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.
EN_145	8	The remaining incidents reported took place in the Southern Region (15 percent), North-Western Region (20 percent ) whilst the Eastern Region recorded a figure of 18 percent.
EN_145	9	Garda policy is that reports of hate crimes or hate incidents will be recorded and investigated “as appropriate, where it is perceived that the perpetrator’s hostility or prejudice against any person, community or institution is on the grounds of the victim’s age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender.”
EN_145	10	Some 617 discriminatory motives were recorded up from a figure of 483 in 2021.
EN_145	11	The most prevalent discriminatory motive was race (32 per cent), followed by sexual orientation (22 per cent) and nationality (21 per cent).
EN_145	12	Gardaí said hate motives were evident in a range of incidents last year.
EN_145	13	The largest percentage involved public order (30 per cent), minor assaults (20 per cent), assault causing harm (9 per cent) and criminal damage (8 per cent).
EN_145	14	An Garda Síochána said that it continued to invest in its network of diversity officers.
EN_145	15	Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman, whose remit includes the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit, said the force continued to have a strong focus on investigating crimes with a hate motive and supporting the victims of these crimes.
EN_145	16	“An Garda Síochána recognises that hate crimes have a huge impact on victims, specifically because they are targeted because of a characteristic of who they are.
EN_145	17	These crimes also have a significant impact on wider communities and society,” she said.
EN_145	18	“These statistics of incidents reported to An Garda Síochána in 2022 with a hate motive build on the baseline figures published for 2021.
EN_145	19	The level of reporting has increased overall.
EN_145	20	“While it is disappointing that any incidents occur which have a hate related motive, it is positive to see more victims coming forward to An Garda Síochána and reporting their experiences.”
EN_145	21	She added that we need as a community to consistently highlight and call out discrimination and hate where it occurs.
EN_145	22	“I urge any person who has experienced or observed prejudice to come forward and report those incidents to us.
EN_145	23	I can assure people that complaints will be dealt with thoroughly and professionally.”
EN_145	24	Case studies included a man jailed for three months in the district court after gardaí witnessed him being involved in homophobic abuse and public order offences.
EN_145	25	In another case, a young black shop worker was forcibly shouldered out of the way by a male customer in his 20s.
EN_145	26	The man was convicted of the offence in the district court and received a ten month suspended sentence.
EN_145	27	The Garda said it had 481 diversity officers across the organisation.
EN_145	28	Last year it implemented a Hate Crime e-Learning Programme developed in conjunction with NGOs, which has been completed by 83.2 per cent of all Garda members.
EN_145	29	It added An Garda Síochána in conjunction with the University of Limerick has continued to facilitate Garda members and Staff participating in the Policing and Human Rights Law in Ireland Level 8 Certificate programme.
EN_145	30	Over 2,000 Garda personnel at all ranks and grades have completed and been awarded this certificate.
EN_147	1	California prosecutors to seek death penalty in 'Golden State Killer' murders
EN_147	2	"Four California district attorneys have jointly agreed to seek the death penalty if they win a conviction of an ex-policeman charged with 13 counts of murder attributed to a serial predator dubbed the ""Golden State Killer,"" prosecutors said on Wednesday."
EN_147	3	The decision, disclosed during a court hearing for the suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, 73, put the prosecutors at odds with a statewide moratorium on capital punishment declared last month by Governor Gavin Newsom.
EN_147	4	DeAngelo was arrested in April 2018, capping more than 40 years of investigation in a case that authorities said was finally solved by DNA evidence.
EN_147	5	"The breakthrough came about two months after the case gained renewed national attention in the bestselling book: ""I'll Be Gone in the Dark."""
EN_147	6	"Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert called it ""probably the most notorious"" series of rapes and killings in California history, a crime spree spanning 11 years from 1975 to 1986 across multiple jurisdictions."
EN_147	7	The defendant was an officer in two small-town California police departments during the 1970s.
EN_147	8	"Schubert and her counterparts from Santa Barbara, Ventura and Orange counties ""unanimously concluded to seek the death penalty in this case,"" her office said in a statement after Wednesday's hearing."
EN_147	9	DeAngelo is charged with 13 counts each of murder and kidnapping.
EN_147	10	"Twelve murder counts accompany ""special circumstance allegations"" - such as rape of the victim - that make him eligible for capital punishment, the prosecutors said."
EN_147	11	The 13th murder count, in Tulare County, does not.
EN_147	12	In all, authorities have said DeAngelo is suspected of dozens of rapes and more than 120 burglaries in and around Sacramento, the eastern San Francisco Bay area and Southern California.
EN_147	13	Four weeks ago, Newsom, a Democrat, said he was imposing an indefinite moratorium on executions for any of the 737 inmates now on death row, the most of any state.
EN_147	14	Newsom said he took the action in part because he was deeply troubled by the possibility of putting an innocent person to death as the state moved to toward resumption of executions after developing a new protocol for lethal injections.
EN_147	15	The governor, whose moratorium angered victims' rights advocates, has since said he was considering a ban on future death sentences.
EN_147	16	California last carried out an execution in 2006.
EN_147	17	Voters passed a 2016 ballot measure aimed at speeding up the process, but that initiative has failed to work, critics say, largely because it lacked additional funding needed to implement necessary reforms.
EN_152	1	White House Dodges Position on Tulsa Race Massacre Reparations
EN_152	2	President Joe Biden is traveling to Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday to mark the 100th anniversary of the racist attack that left as many as 300 people dead and another 10,000 destitute and homeless in what was at the time the wealthiest Black community in the country.
EN_152	3	"But the White House won't say whether Biden personally supports the increased calls for reparations or financial compensation for those affected by the long-overlooked devastation of ""Black Wall Street."""
EN_152	4	"""President Biden believes we have to take core steps right now to fight systemic racismthings like fighting redlining, supporting funding for underfunded schools that are too often located in predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods and more,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday, repeatedly dodging direct questions of whether the president supports reparations for the Tulsa massacre victims."
EN_152	5	"""He believes that first and foremost, the task in front of us is to root out systemic racism where it exists right now."""
EN_152	6	The Biden administration has previously voiced support for a House-led effort to study reparations for descendants of slaves, but similarly hasn't revealed whether he would sign legislation if it reached his desk.
EN_152	7	Biden is scheduled to tour the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, where he'll meet with the three known survivors of the Tulsa race massacre and give public remarks about the event.
EN_152	8	The centennial of the attack on the prosperous Greenwood community has prompted increased calls for financial compensation for the lost wealth and property.
EN_152	9	A decade ago, an Oklahoma commission tasked with studying the issue concluded that reparations are deserved, but it didn't identify who should pay.
EN_152	10	Biden previously has acknowledged the massacre with a tweet on its 99th anniversary last year.
EN_152	11	"""The Tulsa race massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history, and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long,"" he wrote."
EN_152	12	"""It's time to be reckoned with what happened in 1921."""
EN_152	13	But Jean-Pierre said his decision to visit Oklahoma and meet with survivors was driven by his hope to further raise awareness of the attack.
EN_152	14	"Ahead of Biden's visit Tuesday, the White House unveiled initiatives targeting home ownership and small business ownership to address existing racial inequities, promising a ""first-of-its-kind interagency effort"" to address inequity in home appraisals and efforts to fight housing discrimination."
EN_152	15	The government also will increase federal contracting with small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent, which the White House estimates will mean an additional $100 billion for those businesses over five years.
EN_152	16	"""This builds on the president's historic approach to advancing equity and racial justice across the federal government,"" Jean-Pierre said."
EN_155	1	Only a Third of Republicans Think Voting Is a Fundamental Right: Poll
EN_155	2	"Just under a third of Republican voters believe that voting is ""a fundamental right,"" while more than two thirds view casting ballots in elections as ""a privilege,"" new polling shows."
EN_155	3	Democrats in are currently pushing to pass the For the People Act, major legislation which would shore up voting rights and make substantial changes to U.S. elections.
EN_155	4	Meanwhile, Republicans in Washington, D.C., oppose the bill, as GOP lawmakers in state legislatures across the country have introducedand in several states enactedlaws that restrict access to voting. released Thursday by Pew Research Center showed stark divides among Democratic and Republican voters on their views regarding voting rightsappearing to align with the political battle playing out in the Capitol and across the country.
EN_155	5	Only 32 percent of Republican and Republican leaning voters said that they viewed voting as a fundamental right for every citizen that should not be restricted.
EN_155	6	Meanwhile, 67 percent of GOP supporters said voting is a privilege with responsibilities that can be limited.

EN_155	11	Among Democrats and those who lean Democrat, the vast majority were at odds with the mainstream Republican views.
EN_155	12	Seventy-eight percent said they viewed voting as a fundamental right, while just 21 percent said casting a ballot was a privilege.
EN_155	13	Overall, the poll showed that 57 percent of American voters view voting as a fundamental right.
EN_155	14	Comparatively, 42 percent classified casting a ballot in elections as a privilege.
EN_155	15	Black Americans were the most likely to view voting as a fundamental right, with 77 percent classifying the democratic practice that way.
EN_155	16	White Americans were the least likely to view it as a fundamental right, with just a slim majority of 51 percent viewing voting as such.
EN_155	17	The survey, which sampled more than 10,000 respondents, has a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.
EN_155	18	It was conducted from July 8 to July 18.
EN_155	19	President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have condemned their Republican counterparts' position on voting access.
EN_155	20	"They have repeatedly argued that the state legislation being pushed through by GOP lawmakers amounts to a ""new Jim Crow."""
EN_155	21	In Thursday remarks, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer compared Republican arguments to those of segregationists.
EN_155	22	"""You know what they sounded like?"
EN_155	23	"Some of those arguments were reminiscent of what the arch segregationist Southern senators used to use in the '40s and '50s and '60s,"" the New York Democrat on SiriusXM's The Joe Madison Show."
EN_155	24	"Republicans have pushed back against Democrats' criticisms, arguing that their efforts to expand voting rights is a ""power grab."""
EN_155	25	They have said that their election reform bills in states across the country are needed to secure elections.
EN_155	26	However, the wave of bills has been largely inspired by former President 's baseless claims that Biden won the 2020 election through widespread voter fraud.
EN_155	27	In reality, multiple expert analyses have shown that voter fraud is incredibly rare in U.S. elections.
EN_155	28	Meanwhile, Trump's false allegations about the last presidential election have already been thoroughly litigated and wholly discredited.
EN_161	1	Veteran Says Students 'Disgraced' Forces with 'OK' Symbol at Army-Navy Game
EN_161	2	Footage of the students showing the symbol to cameras was caught by ESPN as journalist Rece Davis delivered a sideline report before the game, prompting social media backlash and investigations by both the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
EN_161	3	"The Anti-Defamation League, an NGO that fights against hate groups and anti-Semitism, said most uses of the symbol were ""harmless"" and ""entirely innocuous."""
EN_161	4	"While recognizing that the symbol had been adopted by some white supremacists to represent the letters ""WP"" or ""white power,"" ADL further noted people ""have been falsely accused of being racist or white supremacist"" for using the symbol in its original, harmless context."
EN_161	5	The Southern Poverty Law Center also published an article in 2018 recognizing that the symbol can have a variety of meanings that range from indicating that someone is OK to signaling white supremacist beliefs, adding that its most common use was the harmless signal for all being well.
EN_161	6	"Users of 4chan's /pol/ board adopted the symbol in 2017 as a hoax aimed at trolling liberals and ""triggering"" a reaction from them, according to the SPLC."
EN_161	7	It has also been noted that the gesture is used in a game where people tricked into looking at the circle get punched on the shoulder.
EN_161	8	"Speaking to MSNBC on Sunday, Nance said he could not say ""whether it was a white power symbol or whether it was the 'make you look game'"" flashed by students on Saturday, adding that he would leave that judgment to commanders."
EN_161	9	"But he added: ""The good order and conduct, and the appearance of probably and dignity of West Point and the naval academy have been breached, and that is precisely why by tomorrow morning we are going to have some very decisive looks into precisely what happened."""
EN_161	10	"The veteran also said there was a ""subculture within the armed forces"" that plays a game where the symbol is shown below a person's waist which another person has to put their finger through if they don't want to be punched."
EN_161	11	"""But what we are seeing now is you may be seeing people who have, you know, not doing good order and discipline in the ranks, but you may also be seeing people who have an opportunity to present a white power symbol,"" Nance later added."

EN_189	2	Four high school students in South Carolina will not be allowed to attend the rest of the academic year after they shared a video online mocking the death of
EN_189	3	According to The State, the video, which is not available online, saw the students from White Knoll High School re-enact the death of Floyd and was posted over the weekend.
EN_189	4	George Floyd died of asphyxiation from sustained pressure in 2020 after police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds.
EN_189	5	Floyd's death ignited a summer of protests across the world.
EN_189	6	Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
EN_189	7	"In an email sent to parents and students on Wednesday, principal Ted Daughtrey reportedly wrote: ""Though the video was created off campus at a private home and shared outside of school hours, the unacceptable and disturbing actions of these students negatively impact their school and all of our students."

EN_189	9	The video was shared to TikTok and was met with outrage from fellow students at White Knoll High School who signed a petition to demand the school take action.
EN_189	10	"""As many of you know [four] students posted a TikTok recreating and mocking the event of George Floyd's death."
EN_189	11	"No matter your opinion on George Floyd himself we can agree that mocking his death is immoral, racist and wrong,"" wrote student Arielis Rivera who started the petition."

EN_205	1	Hong Kong vigil organiser arrested on anniversary of Tiananmen Square crackdown
EN_205	2	Police have arrested an organiser of Hong Kong’s annual candlelight vigil remembering the deadly Tiananmen Square crackdown and warned people not to attend the banned event.
EN_205	3	In past years, tens of thousands of people gathered in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park to honour those who died when China’s military put down student-led pro-democracy protests on June 4, 1989.
EN_205	4	Hundreds, if not thousands were killed.
EN_205	5	China’s ruling Communist Party has never allowed public events marking the military’s attack on protesters and citizens, and security was increased in the Beijing square on Friday morning, with police checking pedestrians’ IDs and tour buses shuttling Chinese tourists as on any other day.
EN_205	6	Authorities have suppressed all discussion of the events on the mainland, where the few remaining activists and victims’ advocates are put under increased police monitoring and taken away on involuntary “vacations” around the anniversary.
EN_205	7	Chinese officials claim that the country’s rapid economic development in the years since what they call the “political turmoil” of 1989 proves that decisions made at the time had been correct.
EN_205	8	Along with the deaths of protesters and ordinary citizens, the events of 1989 caused considerable turmoil within the party, with the reformist general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, removed from office and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005.
EN_205	9	Efforts to suppress public memory of the Tiananmen events have lately turned to Hong Kong, where the June 4 Museum was closed this week and police again warned residents not to attend the vigil.
EN_205	10	Police officers at Hong Kong Victoria Park (AP/Vincent Yu) The night-time event in Victoria Park has been banned for a second year under coronavirus pandemic restrictions, although the city has had no local cases for over six weeks.
EN_205	11	But the action comes amid sweeping moves to quell dissent in the city, including a new national security law, election changes and arrests of many activists who participated in pro-democracy protests that swept across Hong Kong in 2019.
EN_205	12	Hong Kong police in vehicles and on foot cordoned off parts of Victoria Park, including football pitches and basketball courts, to prevent any unauthorised gatherings.
EN_205	13	Police said they were aware of calls on social media urging people to turn up for the vigil.
EN_205	14	Taking part in an illegal gathering carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, while merely promoting such an event can result in a year in jail.
EN_205	15	“Police appeal to members of the public to refrain from participating in, advertising or publicising any unauthorised assemblies and prohibited gatherings,” a government statement said.
EN_205	16	In the University of Hong Kong, students took part in the annual washing of the “Pillar of Shame” sculpture, which was erected to remember the victims of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
EN_205	17	University students clean the Pillar of Shame statue (AP/Kin Cheung) Law Kwok-hoi, police senior superintendent, told reporters police had arrested a 36-year-old woman from the Hong Kong Alliance, as well as a 20-year-old food delivery man for advertising and publicising an unauthorised assembly on their social media accounts even after the vigil was banned.
EN_205	18	Chow Hang Tung, vice chairwoman of the group, was arrested on Friday morning, according to the alliance, which organised the vigil and ran the June 4 Museum dedicated to the memory of Tiananmen.
EN_205	19	After the ban was issued, Ms Chow urged people to commemorate the event privately by lighting a candle wherever they are.
EN_205	20	Chow Hang Tung said she was expecting to be jailed (AP/Rafael Wober, File) Last year, thousands went to Victoria Park to light candles and sing songs.
EN_205	21	Police later charged more than 20 activists including Ms Chow for their participation in the event.
EN_205	22	Two other key members of the Hong Kong Alliance — Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho — are behind bars for joining unauthorised assemblies in 2019.
EN_205	23	Ms Chow, a barrister, said in an earlier interview with The Associated Press that she was expecting to be imprisoned at some point for her activism.
EN_205	24	She has been part of the Hong Kong Alliance since 2010.
EN_205	25	“I’m already being persecuted for participating and inciting last year’s candlelight vigil,” she said.
EN_205	26	“If I continue my activism in pushing for democracy in Hong Kong and China, surely they will come after me at some point, so it’s sort of expected.”
EN_206	1	China Says Radiation Has Not Escaped Taishan Nuclear Plant: 'There Is No Leak'
EN_206	2	In the point-by-point rebuttal, the ministry said elevated levels of specific activityradioactivity per unit volume or weightwere detected from the primary circuit coolant during the running of reactor Unit 1.
EN_206	3	The amount was within the acceptable range of the plant's operational requirements.
EN_206	4	"""The safe operation of the nuclear power plant is guaranteed,"" the ministry added."
EN_206	5	"The increase in radioactivity in the primary circuit was the result of damage to fuel rod housings, an ""uncontrollable factor in the production, transportation and loading of fuel,"" the statement explained."
EN_206	6	A minimum amount of fuel rod damage is unavoidable, it said, noting that the phenomenon was common and has not affected nuclear plant operations in other parts of the world.
EN_206	7	"The clarification tallies with a statement provided by Électricité de France (EDF), the plant's minority owner, which told Agence France-Presse on Monday that the buildup of noble gases was a ""known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures."""
EN_206	8	"EDF also cited ""degradation of the housing of the fuel rods"" as the cause of the internal reactor leak, later reported as the inert gases krypton and xenon."
EN_206	9	The utility company is conducting an investigation into relevant reports, it said.
EN_206	10	"China's Environment Ministry said an increase in the level of radioactivity inside the primary circuit is ""completely different"" from an accidental radiation leak."
EN_206	11	As long as the cooling circuit's pressure barrier and the reactor's containment seal meet the necessary requirements, there will be no radioactive leakage into the environment, it noted.
EN_206	12	"Environmental indicators show ""no abnormalities"" around the Taishan nuclear plant, the statement said."
EN_206	13	"""This demonstrates there is no leak at all."""
EN_206	14	"The ministry appeared to suggest a misinterpretation of China's nuclear safety practices in CNN's report, which it called ""not factual."""
EN_206	15	The country's nuclear agency did not revise acceptable radiation limits outside the Taishan plant, but rather reviewed and approved a relevant limit for the specific activity of insert gases from the reactor coolant of Unit 1, it said.
EN_206	16	"""The limit is used for operational management and is not related to radioactivity outside the nuclear power plant."
EN_206	17	"The concept in CNN's report is erroneous,"" the statement added."
EN_206	18	The ministry estimates around five of the reactor's 60,000 fuel rod housings are currently degraded.
EN_206	19	"It said the ratio represents less than 0.01 percent and is ""far lower"" than the maximum 0.25 percent accounted for during the design process."
EN_206	20	The Environment Ministry said it would continue to monitor levels of radioactivity inside the primary circuit of Unit 1 as well as outside the Taishan facility.
EN_206	21	The authorities remain in communication with the International Atomic Energy Agency and French nuclear safety regulators, it said.
EN_206	22	"Monday's explosive CNN report said the U.S. government was assessing two memos by utility firm Framatome, which claimed one of the two nuclear reactors at the Taishan plant was ""leaking fission gas,"" and that China's top nuclear authority was modifying safety standards to avoid a shutdown."
EN_206	23	The French companya subsidiary of EDFdesigned and jointly operates the site in Guangdong, China's most populous province with around 115 million residents.
EN_206	24	Framatome's contact with the U.S. government raised eyebrows and appeared to elevate the urgency of the matter.
EN_206	25	Subsequent reports revealed that the plant's majority owner, China General Nuclear Power Group, was on the U.S. entity list.
EN_206	26	This means that Framatome required a U.S. waiver to provide technical assistance at the plant, where the reactors were connected to the grid in December 2018 and September 2019, respectively.
EN_206	27	"Reached by Newsweek on Monday, a Framatome spokesperson said it was ""supporting resolution of a performance issue with the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong Province, China."""
EN_206	28	"""According to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters."
EN_206	29	"Our team is working with relevant experts to assess the situation and propose solutions to address any potential issue,"" the statement added."
EN_206	30	"Framatome did not elaborate on the urgency of its requests sent to Washington, nor its use of the phrase ""imminent radiological threat."""
EN_216	1	Polish leader blames low birthrate on women using alcohol
EN_216	2	They also argue that the 73-year-old, the most powerful politician in Poland since 2015, is himself partly responsible for the low birthrate in the central European nation of 38 million people.
EN_216	3	In particular, critics point to restrictions on abortion that have discouraged some women from seeking to get pregnant.
EN_216	4	Others note the difficulty young people have in raising families due to rising costs in a country where inflation is now nearly 18%.
EN_216	5	Mr Kaczynski, leader of the populist ruling party Law and Justice, made the comment at the weekend as he travelled around the country seeking to rally support for his party ahead of next year’s parliamentary election.
EN_216	6	I am really a sincere supporter of women’s equality, but I am not a supporter of women pretending to be men, and men pretending to be women.
EN_216	7	He told an audience on Saturday that he does not favour “very early motherhood” because a woman must mature before having children.
EN_216	8	But, he added, if women abuse alcohol up to the age of 25, then “it’s not a good prognosis in these matters”.
EN_216	9	“And here it is sometimes necessary to say a little openly, some bitter things.
EN_216	10	If, for example, the situation remains such that, until the age of 25, girls, young women, drink the same amount as their peers, there will be no children,” said Mr Kaczynski.
EN_216	11	He added that the average man “to develop alcoholism has to drink excessively for 20 years” and “a woman only two”.
EN_216	12	“I am really a sincere supporter of women’s equality, but I am not a supporter of women pretending to be men, and men pretending to be women, because this is something completely different,” he said.
EN_216	13	The remark triggered some predictable jokes along the lines of alcohol actually being helpful to conception, but also a lot of serious criticism.
EN_216	14	When one government representative argued on a TV talk show that alcohol’s influence on fertility is actually a legitimate matter for debate, an opposition politician, Kamila Gasiuk-Pihowicz, shot back: “This is not a debate, it is insulting Polish women.”
EN_216	15	The traditionally Roman Catholic country already had one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws, with abortions allowed in very few cases, before 2020.
EN_216	16	Then, a new ruling said that women may no long terminate pregnancies in cases where the foetus has serious abnormalities and is not viable after birth.
EN_216	17	That sparked the largest protests in Poland in decades.
EN_216	18	There have been cases since then of pregnant women dying even though a risk to the woman’s life is a legal grounds for abortion under the current law.
EN_216	19	Women’s rights advocates say such cases occur because doctors are afraid to terminate pregnancies even when the woman’s life might be at risk, fearing legal consequences to themselves.
EN_216	20	Is Jaroslaw Kaczynski a ruthless, mean cynic, or is he mentally ill?
EN_216	21	Another opposition politician, Aleksandra Gajewska, pondered whether Mr Kaczynski was speaking out of some political calculation, or not.
EN_216	22	“Is Jaroslaw Kaczynski a ruthless, mean cynic, or is he mentally ill?”
EN_216	23	she said.
EN_216	24	Mr Kaczynski defended himself, saying that “an honest politician, if he knows such a thing, must talk about it”.
EN_216	25	The number of births per woman in Poland plummeted from 3 in 1960 to 1.2 in 2003, according to World Bank statistics.
EN_216	26	It began rising again somewhat after 2003, and got a boost after Mr Kaczynski’s government introduced a monthly cash bonus of 500 zlotys (around £93) per child after winning power in 2015, hoping to encourage larger families.
EN_216	27	But the birthrate is again declining, according to Polish government statistics, and Mr Kaczynski admitted last month that the programme is not working as intended.
EN_216	28	The birthrate stood at 1.32 in 2021, according to Polish state statistics, which is low but still higher than some other European countries.

EN_233	1	Showdown On The Markets...
EN_233	2	In 5 Charts There is a good reason why the Chinese understand the saying “May you live in exciting times!”
EN_233	3	as a curse.
EN_233	4	Economic and (geo)political developments in recent weeks and months have indeed been exciting.
EN_233	5	In many areas, it looks as if we are heading for a showdown, for a lasting, formative change.
EN_233	6	The following five charts present the multi-faceted showdowns that are happening right now before our eyes.
EN_233	7	We cannot choose that the times are currently so exciting.
EN_233	8	However, we can choose how to deal with these exciting times so that they do not become a curse for us, but rather an advantage for us and as many people as possible.
EN_233	9	If the parallelism continues in this way, a disinflationary environment can be expected until early summer 2024, after which the second wave of inflation would set in, breaking only in fall 2027. 2.
EN_233	10	Inflation is likely to prove more persistent.
EN_233	11	Some prices are adjusted quickly to reflect changes in the market situation.
EN_233	12	These include, for example, gasoline prices, many food prices or car rental prices.
EN_233	13	Other prices react only with a significant delay, such as garbage charges, the cost of a doctor’s visit, prices in the education sector or rents.
EN_233	14	The different price development of these two subgroups is reflected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in proprietary indices.
EN_233	15	After a historical increase to almost 20%, flexible prices are now falling sharply.
EN_233	16	The sticky prices are behaving quite differently.
EN_233	17	At just under 7%, they are at a level not seen since the inflation wave of the late 1970s/early 1980s.
EN_233	18	They are now rising even more strongly than flexible prices and remain at a high level. 3.
EN_233	19	Interest rate increase cycles.
EN_233	20	“This time is different” – four words suffice to describe one of the greatest economic illusions.
EN_233	21	Every generation of investors has yet to succumb to this illusion that a development – in our case interest rate hikes – which in the past have (always) led to one and the same result – in our case severe economic turbulences – -will not happen this time.
EN_233	22	In everyday life, we would call such behavior stupid. 4.
EN_233	23	A recession seems inevitable.
EN_233	24	While stock markets give the impression that the worst is already behind us, many leading indicators point to the imminent slide into recession, including the Conference Board Leading Economic Index.
EN_233	25	This index is composed of 10 economic indicators selected for their ability to predict changes in economic activity.
EN_233	26	The indicators are selected based on their sensitivity to changes in the economy, their timeliness, and their ability to predict future trends.
EN_233	27	The 10 components include such diverse economic developments as money supply trends, interest rate spreads, consumer confidence, and initial claims for unemployment insurance.
EN_233	28	This index has correctly predicted every recession in the past 5 decades as soon as the index slipped significantly into negative territory. 5.
EN_233	29	Central banks are going for gold. 2022 saw record central bank demand for gold.
EN_233	30	Never since 1950 have central banks increased their gold reserves as much as in 2022, with net purchases totaling 1,136 tons.
EN_233	31	Three aspects require particular attention.
EN_233	32	A breakdown of gold purchases by quarter shows that three quarters of gold purchases by central banks in 2022 were made in the second half of the year.
EN_233	33	Since, as in previous years, it was mainly non-Western central banks that increased their gold holdings, this can be interpreted as a very quick reaction on the part of central banks to the freezing of Russian US dollar and euro currency reserves.
EN_233	34	Second, China has been making official purchases again since November 2022.
EN_233	35	And third, about 50% of gold purchases cannot (yet) be attributed to any country.
EN_233	36	In this economically and (geo)politically fragile environment with an uncertain outcome, gold has once again proven to be a stable anchor in recent weeks and has made strong gains.
EN_233	37	Since the interim low at the beginning of November 2022, gold gained 24.0%, since the beginning of the year 10.7%, and since the outbreak of the banking crisis 11.3%.
EN_233	38	And there is no reason to believe that gold will not continue to excel at this task in the exciting times ahead.
EN_238	1	Biden Tells CDC to Consider Eviction Moratorium Options After Congress Fails to Act
EN_238	2	U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to find a way to extend a ban on evictions for people who have been unable to pay rent during the coronavirus pandemic, after the COVID-19 moratorium lapsed over the weekend and failed to pass an extension.
EN_238	3	"Biden said he's consulted with constitutional scholars about whether executive action would ""pass muster."""
EN_238	4	"""I told the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to go back and consider what options may be available,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday."
EN_238	5	"""The CDC will announce that and any details of how it works."""
EN_238	6	Biden said he's hoping that it will be a new moratorium that will cover about 90 percent of renters.
EN_238	7	Biden's administration spent days arguing that it didn't have the authority to extend the moratorium and that Congress would need to act.
EN_238	8	But U.S. House Speaker and other Democrats have been pressing on the White House to reinstate the moratorium after Congress failed to pass its own version of the extension, allowing it to expire.
EN_238	9	"""House Democrats stand ready to work with the Administration as they search for ways to extend the moratorium and as they urge states and localities to spend the $46.5 billion that Congress allocated,"" Pelosi said in a statement ahead of Biden's announcement."
EN_238	10	"""Our sole focus must be keeping people housed and we must do so with the urgency this moment deserves."""
EN_238	11	A more contagious variant of the novel coronavirus has created a new surge in cases among vulnerable and unvaccinated populations.
EN_238	12	The eviction moratorium initially was put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a public health measure to combat the pandemic and slow the virus' spread.
EN_238	13	After the eviction ban was challenged in a lawsuit, the U.S.
EN_238	14	Supreme Court in June ruled that it could remain in place through Saturday.
EN_238	15	But the Biden administration cited the high court's order as an indication that Congress would need to act for it to go beyond that.
EN_238	16	U.S. House leaders spent much of Friday trying to hash out an extension agreementfirst for one through December and then shifting to one that would go to mid-Octoberbefore negotiations ultimately fizzled.
EN_238	17	The chamber is now out of session for the regularly scheduled August recess, but members have been put on notice to be prepared to possibly return to the Capitol.
EN_238	18	Officials have pointed to the rental assistance funds that lawmakers tucked into a COVID-19 relief package earlier this year as a way to prevent evictions, but of the $46 billion Congress allocated to state and local governments, officials estimate just $3 billion has gone out.
EN_238	19	Several state and local governments, including California, the District of Columbia and New Jersey, have instituted their own eviction moratoriums that remain in effect.
EN_238	20	The Biden administration estimated that about a third of people who would be affected by the federal ban's expiration would still be covered under those local moratoriums.
EN_238	21	President Joe Biden said he's hoping that the CDC will come up with a new eviction moratorium that will cover about 90 percent of renters.
EN_240	1	International human rights group seeks arrest of ex-Sri Lankan president after he fled country
EN_240	2	Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted from office over his country’s economic collapse and fled to Singapore earlier this month.
EN_240	3	He was defence secretary during Sri Lanka’s civil war, which ended in 2009.
EN_240	4	The International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) – an evidence-gathering organisation administered by a South Africa-based non-profit foundation – said its lawyers filed the complaint requesting Rajapaksa’s immediate arrest.
EN_240	5	The complaint alleges Rajapaksa committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions during the civil war “and that these are crimes subject to domestic prosecution in Singapore under universal jurisdiction”.
EN_240	6	Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has left the nation’s 22 million people struggling with shortages of essentials, including medicine, fuel and food.
EN_240	7	Months of protests have focused on the Rajapaksa political dynasty, which has ruled the country for most of the past two decades.
EN_240	8	ITJP executive director Yasmin Sooka said: “The economic meltdown has seen the government collapse, but the crisis in Sri Lanka is really linked to structural impunity for serious international crimes going back three decades or more.
EN_240	9	“This complaint recognises that it’s not just about corruption and economic mismanagement but also accountability for mass atrocity crimes.”
EN_240	10	Sri Lanka’s civil war killed 100,000 people, according to conservative United Nations estimates.
EN_240	11	The actual number is believed to be much higher.
EN_240	12	A report from a UN panel of experts said at least 40,000 ethnic minority Tamil civilians were killed in the final months of the fighting alone.
EN_240	13	Tamil Tiger rebels fought to create an independent state for ethnic minority Tamils.
EN_240	14	The country’s ethnic Sinhala majority credited Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa with the war victory, cementing the family’s political dominance, though accounts of atrocities, autocratic governance and nepotism persisted.
EN_240	15	Efforts to investigate allegations of war crimes were largely suppressed under Rajapaksa leaders.
EN_240	16	After Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country earlier this month, parliamentarians elected former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to serve the remainder of his presidential term.
EN_240	17	He declared a state of emergency with broad powers to act to ensure law and order, and a day after he was sworn in, hundreds of armed troops raided a protest camp outside the president’s office, attacking demonstrators with batons.
EN_240	18	Rights groups have urged the president to immediately order troops and police to cease use of force and said Friday’s display seemed to follow a pattern of Sri Lankan authorities forcefully responding to dissent.
EN_240	19	The political turmoil has threatened Sri Lanka’s potential for economic recovery.
EN_240	20	Wickremesinghe recently said bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund were nearing a conclusion.

EN_241	2	UBS shares storm back to pre-SVB levels with post-deal surge
EN_241	3	The Swiss lender is leading gains among European banks this week, as fears around the stability of the finance sector eased after the €3bn emergency takeover
EN_241	4	UBS Group AG shares have erased almost all of the losses made during the past week’s banking rout, with a bond buyback announced Wednesday adding to confidence that the historic takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG will be a net positive for the firm.
EN_241	5	The Swiss lender is leading gains among European banks this week, as fears around the stability of the finance sector eased after the €3bn emergency takeover.
EN_241	6	Shares gained as much as 3.6% to 20.12 cents on Wednesday, while the company’s bonds recovered some of the losses taken in recent days.
EN_241	7	The stock pared gains to trade flat at 19.39 cents as of 11:51 a.m. in Zurich, but is about 14% higher since the Sunday agreement brokered by the Swiss government.
EN_241	8	Bonds are up between 1-5 cents from Monday’s lows across the board.
EN_241	9	The last-minute merger brokered by the Swiss government on Sunday has left investors racing to break down the implications for UBS, one of the world’s largest wealth managers.
EN_241	10	For now, the benefits in terms of potential cost-savings and dramatically improved market share are outweighing concerns about the complexity of integrating Credit Suisse and the risks on its balance sheet.
EN_241	11	“Market sentiment seemed to have turned positive, with the risk of other European banks impacted by an outright failure of Credit Suisse subsiding,” said Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc.
EN_241	12	“UBS’s gains yesterday reflect our view that this can be a favourable deal for UBS in the long term.
EN_241	13	In the short term, volatility should remain in the European banking space.”
EN_241	14	US bank shares have also been stabilizing from a selloff generated by troubles at regional lenders and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, following reassurances from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the government could intervene to protect the broader US banking system.
EN_241	15	“The biggest pressure point or danger is market participants conflating these events into a 2008 crisis narrative when we do not view it as that at all,” said David Storm, chief investment officer for RBC Wealth Management.
EN_241	16	Earlier Wednesday, the Swiss lender announced it is offering to buy back €2.75bn worth of bonds it issued to investors just days before rescuing Credit Suisse.
EN_241	17	Credit Risk UBS’s credit risk has been jolted since concern over Credit Suisse’s fate, and the role UBS would play in it, roiled global markets.
EN_241	18	After the deal was announced, the cost of insuring UBS’s debt for one year soared to a record.
EN_241	19	On Wednesday UBS’s credit default swaps fell further from Monday’s highs.
EN_241	20	Yet, UBS Group’s five-year CDS remain at elevated levels.
EN_241	21	The buyback decision was a “reasonable action to give investors the option to sell back the bonds should they, having known what they know now, have chosen not to invest,” said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
EN_241	22	UBS is taking a selective approach to the staff and assets it has inherited from Credit Suisse.
EN_241	23	The lender wants to cherry-pick top dealmakers from Credit Suisse Group AG’s investment bank instead of supporting Michael Klein’s plan to build a new independent firm, according to people familiar with the discussions.

EN_243	1	Irish investors consider €238m sale of De Beers’ Mayfair flagship
EN_243	2	Investors with Dublin-based BCP Asset Management could be in line for a significant boost from the company’s boom-era investment in a prime property in London’s exclusive Mayfair district.
EN_243	3	According to CoStar News, BCP is weighing the potential disposal of De Beers’ flagship diamond jewellery store at 45 Old Bond Street for £210 million (€238 million).
EN_243	4	That price is £177.5 million (€201.3 million) more than the £32.5 million (€46.8 million) the company paid for the property in 2004.
EN_243	5	BCP acquired the building on behalf of the Irish Life/BCP Property Fund and BCP private investors.
EN_243	6	Although BCP has yet to decide if it will proceed, CoStar reports that the company instructed a leading London real-estate adviser, Michael Elliott , to approach a number of potential investors last month over a sale of the building, for a net initial yield of 2.83 per cent.
EN_243	7	When BCP acquired the property, 15 years ago, its purchase price equated to an initial yield of 5.2 per cent.
EN_243	8	CoStar adds that there is no guarantee the building will sell.
EN_243	9	Referring to sources, it notes that the owner is “as likely to keep the asset as agree a sale”.
EN_243	10	BCP declined to comment when contacted by The Irish Times.
EN_243	11	Although Brexit uncertainty might be expected to damage international investors’ appetite for 45 Old Bond Street, the Knight Frank agency estimated that as much as £40 billion (€45.3 billion) is targeting real-estate assets in London.
EN_243	12	Comparing the UK capital’s performance to that of its global peers, Faisal Durrani, an associate at Knight Frank, said: “During 2018, the city beat other major global gateway locations, including New York, Tokyo, Paris and Singapore, claiming the crown for the largest volume of commercial property investment globally, which amounted to £16.2 billion.
EN_243	13	This is on par with the level recorded in 2017, highlighting the depth of demand for London’s commercial assets.”
EN_243	14	No 45 Old Bond Street occupies one of the most sought-after retail locations in the world.
EN_243	15	Most of the building’s retail space is let to De Beers until November 2021.
EN_243	16	There is said to be potential to add value by converting the building’s first-floor offices to retail and from reconfiguring the existing retail space to create four new units.
EN_243	17	BCP manages €760 million in direct real estate focused on the central London and central Dublin markets.
EN_243	18	Apart from 45 Old Bond Street, its investments in London include prime commercial properties on New Bond Street and Oxford Street.
EN_243	19	In Dublin, the company’s retail and office portfolio includes Nassau House and Morrison Chambers, on Nassau Street, the Fumbally Lane office complex in Dublin 8, and Block R at Eastpoint Business Park, in Dublin 3.
EN_248	1	Lender Amigo on the brink as it fails to get enough cash to compensate customers
EN_248	2	Lender Amigo, which was once valued at £1.3 billion, is struggling to raise the £45 million it needs to compensate customers – putting the company on track for a potential collapse, it said on Thursday.
EN_248	3	T he business said investors were simply not expressing sufficient interest in pouring money into the troubled lender.
EN_248	4	As things look now, bosses think they will be unable to raise the money needed under the terms of a scheme given the thumbs up by the High Court last year.
EN_248	5	The plan was to raise cash from investors – part of which could be used to pay off wronged customers, while the rest would allow Amigo to keep its doors open.
EN_248	6	However, on Thursday bosses said they have “not received sufficient aggregate indications of interest to cover the total amount”.
EN_248	7	As a result, the board “believes that this target is unlikely to be achieved by May 26”.
EN_248	8	They are trying to cook up a second plan, which would see customers get less compensation and only require current investors to put in a further £6 million on top of what interested investors have promised.
EN_248	9	But, Amigo said, even if they manage to convince investors, they will also need approval from customers and the High Court.
EN_248	10	If neither plan works out, Amigo will wind down, the business said on Thursday morning.
EN_248	11	It is the clearest sign yet from the company that things are not going according to plan.
EN_248	12	The business previously said investors were not showering it with cash.
EN_248	13	Amigo specialised in subprime guarantor loans – the type where a borrower’s friends or family promise they will pay back the loan if the borrower cannot.
EN_248	14	Customers would borrow at interest rates of around 50%.
EN_248	15	Such loans are generally used by people struggling to borrow from other sources – but the lenders have a duty to ensure the people who borrow can still afford the loans.
EN_248	16	Amigo did not.
EN_248	17	According to a decision from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the lender “did not have appropriate processes in place to ensure it adequately assessed borrower and guarantor circumstances before approving a loan” between November 2018 and March 2020.
EN_248	18	“Amigo’s failures led to a high risk of consumer harm, both to borrowers and guarantors,” the FCA said.
EN_248	19	The regulator said it would have fined Amigo nearly £73 million – but decided not to because that would take away from the compensation customers would get.
EN_254	1	'Loyalty is no longer rewarded': Consumer watchdog to look at impact of 'loyalty penalties' imposed by insurance companies
EN_254	2	IRELAND’S CONSUMER WATCHDOG is to carry out “considerable” consumer research into pricing strategies used by utility and financial companies, such as those in the insurance industry.
EN_254	3	Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) chief executive, Fergal O’Leary, will tell the Oireachtas Finance Committee today that it will look at the incidence of switching and price checking.
EN_254	4	The impact of loyalty penalties on particular groups of consumers such as older consumers or those with low financial wellbeing will also be investigated, he says.
EN_254	5	O’Leary says “businesses increasingly know that many consumers don’t have the time or the ability to switch so consumers experience successive price increases” known as “price walking”.
EN_254	6	“Loyalty is no longer rewarded, this is disappointing but it is a reality for consumers,” he states.
EN_254	7	The impact of rollover contracts will also be investigated.
EN_254	8	Dual-pricing The subject of today’s meeting is dual-pricing in the insurance industry.
EN_254	9	Two months ago, the committee said it was launching an investigation into the practice by some insurance firms of charging current customers higher rates on renewal than the rates offered to new clients.
EN_254	10	Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty said businesses throughout the State are being charged “rip-off prices by the insurance industry”.
EN_254	11	“This is squeezing incomes and has led to the closure of businesses throughout the State,” he said.
EN_254	12	Doherty said his own insurance company charged him a renewal price of €856 and he was quoted a premium of €571 on the website after entering the same details.
EN_254	13	He said the practice is widespread across the industry and is “wholly unjustifiable”.
EN_254	14	Doherty requested the Central Bank and the CCPC investigate the issue, with the Central Bank confirming last month that it is reviewing the concerns.
EN_254	15	Today, the CCPC will state that it is also carrying out its own body of work.
EN_254	16	Without pre-empting that work, O’Leary will tell committee members that he expects the review will result in a number of actions in 2020.
EN_254	17	He states that recommendations to Government will be forthcoming on how sectoral regulators and advocacy groups can address any identified consumer harm.
EN_254	18	Switching providers.
EN_254	19	“This will focus in particular on groups of consumers who may find it hard or impossible to switch providers,” he said.
EN_254	20	Specifically in relation to insurance, the CCPC said it will engage with the Central Bank as their research and bank’s market study progresses.
EN_254	21	It also plans to engage with national and European counterparts to share information and keep up to date with developments.
EN_254	22	A public awareness campaign will be rolled out which will inform and provide information to consumers as to how they can switch service providers.
EN_254	23	O’Leary says he is “acutely aware” that the committee is concerned about the issue of dual pricing.
EN_254	24	“The CCPC recognises the importance of this work and is committed to playing our part, as quickly as we can, in providing an evidence base for firm actions to help consumers.
EN_254	25	O’Leary noted that two weeks ago a European Directive to modernise consumer law was adopted.
EN_254	26	It aims to enhance transparency in online transactions, particular regarding the use of online reviews, personalised pricing based on algorithms or higher ranking of products due to paid placements.
EN_254	27	In relation to personalised pricing, the Directive will ensure that a company has to inform consumers when the price given to them is ‘personalised, on the basis of automated decision-making.
EN_254	28	Insurance Ireland will also appear before the committee today.
EN_254	29	It is due to tell members that as a trade agency it does not hold the data of its members on pricing, and therefore will be limited in what information if can give.
EN_254	30	In its opening statement today, it highlights that the Insurance Ireland has agreed fully engage with the Central Bank on its review of dual-pricing by the insurance industry in Ireland.
EN_262	1	Bank of Estonia: Salary growth as strong as before crisis
EN_262	2	Wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels, Bank of Estonia economist Orsolya Soosaar said on Friday.
EN_262	3	released on Friday showed, in the second quarter of 2021, the average monthly gross wages and salaries were €1,538, which is 7.3 percent higher than the year before.
EN_262	4	"""The increase in working hours per employee contributed to the acceleration of wage growth and wages grew faster in private companies than in the public sector."
EN_262	5	"Taking into account seasonal factors, the average salary increased by 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter,"" Soosaar said ."
EN_262	6	She said salary growth would have been even faster if the share of employees by different fields of activity had remained the same as last year.
EN_262	7	"""The recovery in the number of jobs in lower-than-average-wage activities, such as accommodation and food service activities, is somewhat holding back the increase in average wages,"" she said."
EN_262	8	"""Economic growth has accelerated this year, but companies have recruited fewer employees than expected for this."
EN_262	9	"Thus, labor productivity has increased, which provides an opportunity to raise wages,"" the economist said."
EN_262	10	"""Although restrictions to stop the spread of the virus were still in place in the second quarter, companies had become more optimistic about further employment growth in anticipation of the lifting of restrictions and the summer virus low."
EN_262	11	"The share of companies that perceive labor shortages as a significant problem also increased,"" she added."
EN_262	12	Despite the larger number of jobseekers in the labor market, the perception of labor shortage increases wage pressure, Soosaar said.
EN_262	13	Swedbank: Wage growth in Estonia fueled by labor shortages.
EN_262	14	Swedbank senior economist Liis Elmik said a shortage of specialists is the reason behind accelerated wage growth in the second quarter.
EN_262	15	"""The increase in the average salary corresponded exactly to Swedbank's forecast."
EN_262	16	Wage growth accelerated from 5 percent in the first quarter to 7 percent in the second quarter.
EN_262	17	"Wage growth picked up, as a year ago the average wage rose by only 1 percent, and without the wage compensation of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the wage level would have fallen,"" Elmik said."
EN_262	18	Elmik said the average gross salary has increased by 8 percent in two years.
EN_262	19	While wages and salaries in accommodation, catering and trade were still 1-2 percent lower in the second quarter than two years ago, then 15-16 percent more was earned in IT and medicine than two years ago.
EN_262	20	"""About 30 percent of entrepreneurs see labor shortages as their biggest obstacle to development."
EN_262	21	According to entrepreneurs, labor shortages are at pre-crisis levels in industry, services and construction.
EN_262	22	"According to surveys, the fear of unemployment among employees has also decreased and reached the pre-crisis level,"" the economist said."
EN_262	23	Although unemployment is still relatively high, Elmik said that it is difficult for employers to find suitable specialists.
EN_262	24	"""Left without work during the coronavirus crisis were many tourism and transport sector employees who cannot immediately become programmers, doctors or teachers,"" she added."
EN_262	25	Swedbank estimates that the average gross salary will increase by 6 percent this year.
EN_262	26	Next year, the average gross salary will rise slightly less, by more than 5 percent.
EN_265	1	EU countries agree on a uniform vaccination passport
EN_265	2	EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders published a message on Twitter on Wednesday in which he welcomed the agreement of the EU states.
EN_265	3	The plan is to use the uniform vaccination pass this summer.
EN_265	4	Also known as a “Green Pass”, this is intended to provide information on whether a person can spread the Coronavirus or at least how likely it is.
EN_265	5	In addition to information about vaccinations, the certificate should also contain test results and information about a Coronavirus infection.
EN_265	6	This would make it possible for the relevant people to travel again without the obligation to test or quarantine.
EN_265	7	The issue of a uniform vaccination certificate was an important concern, especially for countries that are dependent on tourism, such as Greece, Spain and Cyprus.
EN_265	8	Some of these countries had already worked out national solutions.
EN_265	9	The agreement now proposed would oblige the national authorities to issue the said EU document to their citizens upon request.
EN_265	10	However, the decision as to which restrictions will be lifted and whether the certificate allows further relief remains with the individual EU countries.
EN_265	11	Nevertheless, the 27 states undertook to recognize the vaccination certificates of the other EU states.
EN_265	12	According to the reports, the “Green Passport” should not be a requirement for travel within the EU, but merely help to facilitate border crossings.
EN_265	13	What exactly this means is still unclear.
EN_265	14	In addition, the vaccination card should only be used as long as the Corona crisis lasts.
EN_265	15	An important detail: The respective countries should also be able to determine themselves whether they recognize vaccinations with vaccines that are only approved in certain countries, but not in the entire EU.
EN_265	16	The next step is to be approved by the EU Parliament so that the details can then be negotiated between the EU institutions.
EN_265	17	Some MEPs still have concerns about data protection, in particular.
EN_265	18	For Germany, it is planned that before the summer vacation people should be able to prove that they are completely vaccinated using a smartphone app.
EN_265	19	This was announced on Wednesday from government circles, as the German Press Agency (dpa) reported.
EN_265	20	The digital certificate is intended to give those affected the opportunity to quickly and forgery-proof provide evidence that they have been fully vaccinated and therefore regain certain basic rights again, for example when traveling on vacation.
EN_265	21	The certificates should not be stored centrally on a server, but rather on the user’s smartphone.
EN_265	22	In addition to the entry in the analogue yellow vaccination certificate, people who do not have a smartphone receive a printout of the digitally readable vaccination certificate as a QR code on paper.
EN_265	23	Even if the smartphone is lost or changed, the certificate can be read into a smartphone again using the printed QR code.
EN_265	24	The digital vaccination certificates are to be issued in the vaccination centers and at medical practices.
EN_265	25	The German government is currently looking for a method by which people who have already been fully vaccinated can receive their certificate retrospectively.
EN_265	26	The federal government is also discussing whether Corona infections that have been overcome should also be evaluated in the same way as complete vaccination protection but this may depend on research results.
EN_265	27	As previously stated in the Official Journal of the European Union, the digital vaccination certificate will be created in Germany under the leadership of the American technology group IBM.
EN_265	28	The Cologne start-up Ubirch, the Swabian IT service provider Bechtle and Govdigital, a cooperative association of ten IT service providers from the public sector, are also involved.
EN_265	29	Similar to the official Corona warning app of the German government, the development of the system is to be programmed as an open source project and made transparent.
EN_265	30	The vaccination certificate should then be stored either in the Corona warning app or a separate application programmed by IBM.
EN_265	31	Contrary to the concepts originally discussed, the solution is not to rely on encryption and storage in a so-called blockchain, but on traditional encryption techniques.
EN_266	1	Chief of Youtube says Youtubers are 'Basement-Dwelling Idiots'
EN_266	2	YouTube’s Chief Product Officer has insulted his own users as basement-dwellers who deserve to be relegated by the algorithm in favor of “authoritative” mainstream sources.
EN_266	3	Ok let everyone teach him a lesson, everyone should delete their own Youtube accounts and move to Bitchute.com.
EN_266	4	Why there?
EN_266	5	Because there’s simply no censorship there!
EN_266	6	Neal Mohan made the remarks during an interview with Protocol’s editor at large David Pierce after he was asked if YouTube had to switch its approach to moderating content given the ever changing advice of health authorities in relation to the coronavirus.
EN_266	7	Mohan said that this was the reason YouTube was “raising up authoritative voices,” which is a euphemism for suppressing voices that aren’t part of the mainstream media, despite the fact that the public’s trust in the media during the coronavirus pandemic has plummeted even further.
EN_266	8	He then went on to insult his own user base as basement-dwelling idiots.
EN_266	9	“As opposed to, you know, it’s somebody espousing their opinions about a mask, you know, in their basement,” said Mohan.
EN_266	10	“This is coming from an authoritative channel, a news source, a medical professional, and if that’s the case, we think there’s going to be some context that’s provided around the question of masks.
EN_266	11	And even if that guidance changes, it will be reflected in sort of how an authoritative voice or channel talks about it.”
EN_266	12	Mohan then made it clear how non-mainstream channels are algorithmically shadow banned by “removing or reducing views of the videos where that same level of authority hasn’t been established.”
EN_266	13	Of course, the only reason why so-called “authoritative” sources are now doing so well on YouTube is because the company rigged its own algorithm to heavily favor them while dumping the very people who helped build YouTube on the trash heap.
EN_266	14	Last month, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki recently said that information which challenged the World Health Organization would be removed, despite the fact that the WHO was directly complicit in helping China cover-up the severity of coronavirus in its early stages and despite the fact the organization gave harmful advice in ordering countries not to close their borders early on.
EN_266	15	“Mohan’s comments exemplify how the changes YouTube has made in relation to the coronavirus and news coverage have made it almost impossible for independent creators to cover current events, even when the mainstream media outlets that are being raised up have a track record of getting it wrong,”
EN_266	16	This is what happened when companies are bought from whites and then operated by Jews like Susan Wojcicki and Indians like Neal Mohan.
EN_266	17	You get censored and disrespected.
EN_270	1	Fox News Requires Employees to Upload Vaccination Status As Hosts Push Vaccine Doubts
EN_270	2	Fox News has required its employees to upload their vaccination statuses into a company database.
EN_270	3	While the network's hosts and guests have promoted vaccines in the past, they have also pushed doubts about the vaccines' safety.
EN_270	4	"The media outlet required all in-person and work-from-home employees to upload their vaccination status to a system called ""Workday"" by August 17, according to an internal memo recently published by AdWeek."
EN_270	5	Fox News doesn't require its employees to be vaccinated.
EN_270	6	However, it still required them to provide vaccination information for contact tracing and space planning purposes to follow guidelines from the U.S.
EN_270	7	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state and city health authorities, the memo said.
EN_270	8	Fox News is requiring its employees to upload their COVID-19 employee vaccination statuses even though its hosts have casted doubts on vaccines' efficacy.

EN_270	11	"From as early as July, Fox News informed employees that vaccinated individuals who upload their status to the system could get a ""FOX Clearpass."""
EN_270	12	The pass allows employees to work without a mask or social distancing.
EN_270	13	All unvaccinated individuals must do both.
EN_270	14	"Unvaccinated workers must also conduct a ""WorkCare Daily Screen"" to reduce the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak."
EN_270	15	"Though the outlet has promoted vaccines, its employee vaccination disclosure policy and Clearpass both contrast with its broadcasts that have sowed doubts about vaccines' safety and railed against ""vaccine passports."""
EN_270	16	"Over the past few months, Fox News hosts have repeatedly opposed ""vaccine passports""special privileges given to vaccinated individualsas an anti-American threat to personal freedoms."
EN_270	17	"Its hosts have also opposed mask mandates as unnecessary and even a form of ""child abuse."""
EN_270	18	The network's most popular host, Tucker Carlson, has claimed that the vaccines are deadlier than the government will admit .
EN_270	19	"Carlson has also said that asking people whether they're vaccinated is a ""super vulgar personal question."""
EN_270	20	"He compared it to asking people A July 16 study from the media watchdog group Media Matters found that 60 percent of Fox News' vaccination segments from June 28 through July 11 pushed ""anti-vaccine propaganda."""
EN_270	21	The study tallied each time any speaker either said that vaccines were unnecessary or dangerous.
EN_270	22	It also tallied whenever a speaker said that immunization efforts represented a coercive form of government overreach or a violation of personal freedoms.

EN_284	3	A mobile billboard, organised by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), took to the streets of Dublin in a bid to spread the message of growing concern over the outbreak of coronavirus at meat factories.
EN_284	4	Outbreaks have been reported at 16 Irish plants, with more than 800 workers infected with the virus so far.
EN_284	5	The Dáil has heard how some 60 workers at Rosderra Meats’ Edenderry plant in Co Offaly had tested positive for the virus.
EN_284	6	Meanwhile, around 100 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed at its plant in Roscrea, Co Tipperary.
EN_284	7	Dawn Meats temporarily closed one of its plants following an outbreak of Covid-19.
EN_284	8	Four cases of the disease have been confirmed at the meat processor’s facility in Kilbeggan in Co Westmeath.
EN_284	9	In a statement, the food company said when it became aware of four confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers in Kilbeggan, it was decided to defer production in the plant.
EN_284	10	“We have implemented a detailed series of measures to manage risks associated with Covid-19, and to maintain social distancing in our facilities in line with procedures recommended by the HSE (Health Service Executive) and other Government agencies,” the statement read.
EN_284	11	Peta director Elisa Allen said: “A deadly disease that originated in a meat market is now sweeping through meat-processing plants and endangering workers, their families, and the whole community.
EN_284	12	“No one needs meat – that’s why Peta is calling for these facilities to be shut down immediately, for everyone’s protection.
EN_284	13	The novel coronavirus originated in a Chinese ‘wet market’, where live and dead animals are sold for human consumption; swine flu began on a factory farm; and other influenza viruses have been traced to chickens.
EN_284	14	“The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warns that approximately 75% of recently emerged infectious diseases affecting humans originated in other animals.”
EN_284	15	The mobile billboard, which reads “no one needs to kill to eat”, was parked outside the gates of Leinster House while TDs debated the ongoing impact of Covid-19 in the Dail.

EN_289	1	Government COVID-19 council opposes relaxing event capacity limits
EN_289	2	The government's coronavirus scientific council (Valitsuse teadusnõukoda) opposes lifting event capacity restrictions as proposed by culture minister Tõnis Lukas (Isamaa) Friday.
EN_289	3	The council was publicly backed by social affairs minister Tanel Kiik (Center) in this, continuing a tendency for the body – set up specifically to deal with the pandemic – to receive full government support, unlike the Health Board (Terviseamet), which has sometimes found itself at the receiving end of governmental criticism.
EN_289	4	"Lukas, whose remit includes sporting events as well as the arts, suggested According to a report on ETV news show ""Aktuaalne kaamera"" (AK) Friday, however, the scientific council, headed up by Professor Irja Lutsar, does not agree with this in most cases, though said some exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis."
EN_289	5	One such upcoming case is the inaugural WRC rally due to take place in South Estonia in early September.
EN_289	6	Over ten thousand rally passes have been issued, in batches, and competing drivers in some cases come from countries currently defined as coronavirus high-risk.
EN_289	7	Estonia has coped well with curbing its coronavirus spread and, following a localized outbreak centered on in Tartu from the second half of July to early August, the infection rate is back to exhibiting a downward trend, the scientific council, which following a summer break, said. held its first meeting Friday, At the same time, the council conceded practical realities and pointed out it supports the fewest restrictions sensibly possible, including allowing scheduled hospital treatments, such as operations, to go ahead, as well as not jeopardizing the nationwide return to school on September 1.
EN_289	8	"""We've said this before: This virus is something we all need to learn to live with."
EN_289	9	That is also our position today [on the council]; we must live with this virus as best we can so one side should not destroy the other.
EN_289	10	"While we would like to eradicate this virus, sadly, it's not that easy,"" Professor Lutsar told AK."
EN_289	11	Scientific council versus Health Board.
EN_289	12	The scientific council has in the recent past taken somewhat of a moderate line on the coronavirus, s and and , while at the same time recommending caution on the lifting of restrictions , at least so far as public events go.
EN_289	13	The council has sometimes also disagreed with the Health Board (Terviseamet) on matters of public health and the coronavirus, but seems to have had the backing of the government to date.
EN_289	14	The Health board, by contrast, was already under attack from the prime minister before the peak of the pandemic had passed, and through the course of summer has lost both its chief, , and her deputy .
EN_289	15	"The Health Board has also taken a different, often opposing, stance from the scientific council on some of the key issues at stake: , the and Social affairs minister Tanel Kiik (Center) said that: ""Scheduled treatment must continue, and instruction in education must in the main part continue in contact learning."
EN_289	16	"Of course, there may be exceptions by county, or study level, and also perhaps by target group … but as for nationwide bans and restrictions, we'll try to establish as few of those as possible."""
EN_289	17	Kiik noted that such restrictions as remain will mostly focus on travel and public event audience numbers.
EN_289	18	At present, indoor public events are limited to 1,500 spectators or 50 percent capacity – whichever is lower.
EN_289	19	Outdoor public events, such as this weekend's Arvamusfestival, can go to 2,000 spectators.
EN_289	20	The scientific council as noted was set up in response to the pandemic, and has generally towed the government line .
EN_289	21	The Health Board is the state body primarily tasked with public health and which obviously predates the pandemic.
EN_293	1	Comment on Roll back of pub opening hours under consideration by Cabinet as Covid numbers
EN_293	2	rise
EN_293	3	Updated 45 minutes ago.
EN_293	4	THE CABINET IS believed to be considering a new closing time of midnight for pubs and restaurants as it meets to work through new advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) today.
EN_293	5	It’s being reported that ministers are also in agreement on the widening of Covid certificate use to include cinemas and theatres, but not gyms and hairdressers as predicted.
EN_293	6	Widening the use of the Covid vaccine pass across society was expected, as well as making antigen testing more widely available, which is also still on the table.
EN_293	7	Reports also indicate that a direction for employees to work from home where possible is now expected from the end of this week.
EN_293	8	The proposals are being recommended in response to rising Covid-19 case numbers across the country in recent weeks.
EN_293	9	It follows a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 last night, attended by the Taoiseach, senior ministers and public health officials.
EN_293	10	Speaking to reporters on his way into Cabinet this morning, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the current situation is “very concerning” and that there is an obligation on everyone to reduce social interactions to help reduce incidence rates.
EN_293	11	“The overall objective is to prevent people from getting very sick, going into hospitals, ICUs.
EN_293	12	We simply have to limit the increase we are experiencing at the moment,” Martin said.
EN_293	13	He said the government will provide notice over any decisions the government makes today on Covid-19 measures, but he added that “the situation … was one that does demand fairly quick action in respect of easing that pressure on the acute hospital system over the next number of weeks”.
EN_293	14	The Taoiseach said while the government has to make decisions today, collectively, as a society, people have to look out for each other and to be very aware that the “situation is getting worse and will get worse before it gets better”.
EN_293	15	'I think there's an obligation on all of us to reduce socialisation, to take care of everybody', Taoiseach @MichealMartinTD says, adding 'we simply have to limit the increase' of people needing hospital and ICU treatment for
EN_293	16	NPHET said last week that the re-imposition of social and economic restrictions was not currently being recommended but “cannot fully be ruled out”.
EN_293	17	It comes as the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 reached its highest level since February.
EN_293	18	The latest figures from the Department of Health reveal that 622 people are in hospital with the virus, including 117 people in intensive care units.
EN_293	19	A total of 4,570 new cases of the illness were reported yesterday.
EN_293	20	The government is also aiming to expand the vaccine booster programme to those aged between 50 and 59.
EN_293	21	A letter from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) to Government confirming this advice was received last night.
EN_293	22	Speaking on the way into this morning’s Cabinet meeting, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly welcomed the advice, saying there would now be a “very, very strong” focus on boosters.
EN_293	23	With reporting by Hayley Halpin
EN_295	1	Comment on Factfind: Does the WHO 'not recommend' using rapid Covid tests in schools, as Norma Foley claimed?
EN_295	2	Serial testing also took place at food-processing facilities, including meat plants, due to (among other things) the congregated nature of work in factories and the lifestyles of workers (who often shared accommodation and transport to and from work).
EN_295	3	And serial testing was not just limited to workplaces: it was also introduced in Direct Provision centres – residential settings where people live in clusters – last autumn.
EN_295	4	It is worth pointing out that in all of these settings, serial testing was introduced reactively, after large clusters often involving dozens of cases occurred in nursing homes, meat plants and Direct Provision centres.
EN_295	5	Although a number of outbreaks have been linked to schools since they returned last August, none of these are currently active (because schools have been closed since before Christmas), meaning that a decision to introduce serial testing would now be proactive.
EN_295	6	Asymptomatic cases.
EN_295	7	One interpretation of the WHO’s advice does suggest that antigen testing could be used to prevent large outbreaks from occurring ahead of time.
EN_295	8	Part of the agency’s guidance states that in a situation where there is widespread community transmission of Covid-19, antigen tests could be used “for early detection and isolation of positive cases” in places like care homes, prisons, and schools.
EN_295	9	The advice does warn that those who produce a negative result with an antigen test should be managed safely, and that the result “cannot completely exclude an active Covid-19 infection”.
EN_295	10	It therefore suggests that if rapid testing occurs in this scenario, there should be repeat testing where possible along with the continued use of PCR-type tests to confirm cases, particularly among patients who show symptoms of Covid-19.
EN_295	11	However, there is a catch; the advice later suggests this should also occur when the ability of health services to carry out regular PCR testing is diminished.
EN_295	12	It suggests that if this were to occur, antigen testing could be used if it was not possible to test all or any suspect cases of Covid-19 using PCR-type tests.
EN_295	13	But the WHO also outlines a number of situations in which antigen tests should specifically not be used – including settings such as screening at points of entry at airports, for blood donation, and elective surgery.
EN_295	14	Crucially, another scenario deemed inappropriate for antigen testing is in “individuals without symptoms unless the person is a contact of a confirmed case” of Covid-19.
EN_295	15	The WHO suggests that where a person does not have symptoms of Covid-19 and has not been in contact with a confirmed case, the likelihood that they have Covid-19 – based on epidemiology, case contact, and clinical findings – is low.
EN_295	16	Asked by TheJournal.ie to clarify her remarks following her claim on News at One on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Minister pointed to this part of the WHO’s advice.
EN_295	17	“The current WHO advice on antigen testing is that it is “reasonable to use to investigate outbreaks”.
EN_295	18	However, it is also advised that Ag-RDTs should not be used in routine surveillance testing where there are zero or only sporadic cases,” a statement said.
EN_295	19	‘Widespread community transmission’ This is where things get complicated.
EN_295	20	On the one hand, the WHO specifically does recommend the use of antigen tests in schools in some situations.
EN_295	21	Its advice can be interpreted as supporting regular testing where there is widespread community transmission of Covid-19 to detect cases early and to isolate those who test positive.
EN_295	22	But this recommendation appears to be dependent on situations where PCR-type testing is no longer available because the testing system has become overburdened.
EN_301	1	More than 100 ventilators available in Estonia as of October
EN_301	2	The number of new cases and outbreaks of coronavirus in Estonia has increased over the last week but, compared to spring, there are fewer people receiving treatment in hospital.
EN_301	3	ERR looked into how many breathing apparatuses Estonia has which could be used for COVID-19 patients in intensive care.
EN_301	4	Tartu University Hospital has 66 devices, of which nearly two thirds are in daily use, according to the clinic's intensive care and anesthesiology department head Joel Starkopf.
EN_301	5	"He explained: ""Breathing apparatuses are connected to beds, 80 percent of beds in intensive care are occupied, with planned but emergency patients."
EN_301	6	All the patients there are not under ventilation necessarily, but staff are still occupied.
EN_301	7	"And the bed."""
EN_301	8	Tallinn's North Estonia Medical Center follows Tartu University Clinic as the second hospital in Estonia with a considerable number of ventilation devices, which is why there is an agreement that all patients in the Southern region, from Narva to Valga and for hospitals in Järva County and Viljandi, will initially be directed to the Tartu University Hospital.
EN_301	9	"Starkopf said: ""We are centralizing these infected people to the clinic, that is in its so-called first stage."
EN_301	10	We think it is reasonable, as the clinic's competence is among the best.
EN_301	11	The patients will receive the best treatment there.
EN_301	12	These are critical patients, whose treatment will last a long time, often two weeks.
EN_301	13	"This trully needs complex handling and is why I think this is the best strategy in the region."""
EN_301	14	It must also be taken into consideration that in some local hospitals, such as Jõgeva, do not have any ventilation devices.
EN_301	15	Some, such as Valga, Võru and Kuressaare hospitals, only have a few, with some already in use for heart attack and brain trauma patients.
EN_301	16	Pärnu Hospital chairman Urmas Sule said the hospital has the capacity to take up to 20 patients needing ventilation in intensive care.
EN_301	17	"""We have one isolator in a normal situation, which has the capability of isolating an infected patient for intensive care."
EN_301	18	If we want to go a step forward and test our capabilities, we must create an entire wing.
EN_301	19	"That would give us the capacity of adding six or seven beds,"" Sule said."
EN_301	20	"The hospital chief continued: ""If the number of COVID-patients needing intensive care were to increase even more, we would be capable of providing 20 beds."
EN_301	21	"But that would mean a dramatic hospital reorganization."""
EN_301	22	By mid-October, the Health Board (Terviseamet) had mapped a total of 250 ventilation devices in the medicine database, with 80 percent being used daily.
EN_301	23	That would leave 50 devices available for use by COVID-19 patients.
EN_301	24	If the private sector's and the defense forces' appliances are added, there are more than 100 devices available.
EN_301	25	The number of apparatuses will increase even more before the end of year, as 185 devices will be available.
EN_301	26	Tartu University Hospital will also receive 25, Pärnu Hospital will get seven.
EN_301	27	Starkopf said it is difficult to assess whether this will be enough, as noone can be sure how the epidemiological situation progresses.
EN_306	1	Asthma patient discharged herself from 'unsafe' crowded hospital
EN_306	2	A young teacher with severe asthma has described how she had to discharge herself from hospital as she feared her condition would worsen after spending the night in an overcrowded corridor.
EN_306	3	On Monday, Rachel Murray was advised by her GP to attend the emergency department at Galway University Hospital as she was having an asthma attack.
EN_306	4	She presented at 8.30pm and was treated around 2.30am, although in the past her condition meant she received almost immediate treatment.
EN_306	5	“I had emergency IVs, steroids and back-to-back nebulizers to try and get my airways to open, I shouldn’t have been left that long waiting for that,” she said.
EN_306	6	It is not fair on staff, what they have to deal with.
EN_306	7	You can see they are so over-worked.
EN_306	8	Rachel was admitted as a patient but was forced to wait for a bed and was moved to a corridor at 6am.
EN_306	9	“I was put in a really narrow hallway, there were five trolleys in front of me with people on them, and on the side another two bays with trolley-beds,” she said.
EN_306	10	She saw two elderly people spend most of the night on chairs.
EN_306	11	Rachel told the Irish Examiner she has been on trolleys overnight before but never in such a crowded situation.
EN_306	12	I had no real issue with the trolley at first, but during the day it was really busy.
EN_306	13	People were constantly coming and going.
EN_306	14	She had to use her own portable nebuliser as there were no sockets on the corridor for nurses to plug in the hospital’s equipment.
EN_306	15	Breaking point.
EN_306	16	Around 3pm a drunk person was brought in; not wearing a mask, “coughing and spitting” at staff, she said.
EN_306	17	“At that point, I decided I wanted to discharge myself, it wasn’t safe there for someone like me,” she said.
EN_306	18	“There was a constant stream of patients, we were on top of each other.
EN_306	19	Trolleys were banging into each other.
EN_306	20	It was just chaos for the nurse.”
EN_306	21	Staff tried to convince her to stay, but agreed ultimately she could leave with a new prescription.
EN_306	22	A spokeswoman for University Hospital Galway said 282 staff were absent from Friday for Covid-related reasons.
EN_306	23	The hospital apologised for “significant delays” experienced on Tuesday especially, and she said they are “seriously impacted” by an extremely high number of Covid-19 patients.
EN_306	24	Earlier this week the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation described the emergency department at the Mercy University Hospital as “overcrowded, chaotic and dangerous”.
EN_306	25	Yesterday there were 416 patients on trolleys or chairs unable to get a hospital bed across all hospitals, the INMO said.
EN_311	1	Pyatt: US actively interested in peace amd stability in the East Mediterranean
EN_311	2	The delimitation of maritime zones cannot be resolved through unilateral action, said on Monday, speaking to the Greek press after the prime minister's meetings in Washington last week, but through through talks with the affected countries, and based on international law.
EN_311	3	Asked to comment on the Turkey-Libya memoranda of understanding on maritime zones, the American ambassador said that the State Department's legal definition for the memorandums is that they are vague, and he pointed out that the islands, including Crete, have the same maritime rights as mainland areas.
EN_311	4	The United States, Pyatt reiterated, want the East Mediterranean to become a zone of collaboration and stability.
EN_311	5	The US, he noted, wants the de-escalation of tension between Greece and Turkey and will definitely take a diplomatic action towards that direction.
EN_311	6	"Speaking of relations between Greece and the United States, Pyatt said they are very strong and must now go a step beyond to becoming excellent, which he described as ""a big success.""."
EN_311	7	The relationship with Greece is one of the strongest relations the US could have in all of Europe, the ambassador said.
EN_311	8	Pyatt also commented on Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis ' address at the Atlantic Council, saying he presented his positions in Washington effectively, showing Greece is a reliable partner.
EN_311	9	Greece is no longer a part of the problem, the ambassador said, but of the solution.
EN_311	10	"The Greek premier clarified at all his meetings with American officials the Greek positions, what Greece would not tolerate, and when it would request the intervention of the United States, Pyatt said, adding that Mitsotakis ""is someone we can trust, who wants solutions and shares the American dream"" of the future of Atlantic relationships, focused on market reforms."
EN_311	11	American investors expressed keen interest in Greece and during the coming weeks, a series of business and investment missions supported by the American government will visit Greece, he noted.
EN_311	12	The ambassador also noted the interest shown by top American officials in promoting relations between the two countries, mentioning the talks held with US Secretaries of Commerce Wilbur Ross and the State Department Mike Pompeo, who has become an enthusiastic supporter of Greek-American relations after his visit to Greece in October, a momentum that must be maintained.
EN_311	13	In this framework, Pyatt said, the following US State Department officials would visit Greece shortly: Assistant Secretary (Energy Resources) Francis Fannon, Deputy Assistant Secretary (European and Eurasian Affairs) Matthew Palmer, and Acting Assistant Secretary (European and Eurasian Affairs) Philip Reeker.
EN_311	14	"He also said he would personally meet with Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, chair of the ""Greece 2021"" committee on the bicentennial of the Greek War of Independence this week."
EN_334	1	Ratings: Constant increase in Eesti 200's support stops
EN_334	2	Support for non-parliamentary Eesti 200, who has enjoyed a constant increase in their support among voting-age Estonians over the last months, has flatlined during negotiations to form a new Reform-Center government, according to survey from the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues and Norstat Eesti AS.
EN_334	3	As of the latest party ratings survey, Reform is supported by 29.1 percent of respondents, Center is supported by 21.5 percent, followed by Eesti 200 with 15.5 percent of respondents saying they would vote for them if elections were to happen immediately.
EN_334	4	The top three are closely followed by the Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) with 15.4 percent support, The Social Democratic Party (SDE) collected 7.9 percent of respondents' support, with outgoing coalition Isamaa Party getting 6.3 percent.
EN_334	5	Although support ratings have remaind stable to start the year, there have been changes in long-term trends.
EN_334	6	Eesti 200's support saw remarkable increase in the end of 2020, but has flatlined now.
EN_334	7	In addition, EKRE, who was in a slump in December has grown its support by 1.8 percent over the last four weeks, meaning that EKRE have closed the 2.2 percent gap Eesti 200 had over them in December. 50.6 percent of respondents voted in favor of the Reform-Center combination that is currently negotiating to form a new government .
EN_334	8	The opposition parties found 29.6 percent support among the voting-age adult sample.

EN_334	10	Martin Mölder, a researcher at the University of Tartu's Johan Skytte Institute for Political Studies, said Eesti 200's position weakening does not come as much of a surprise as the high level of their support had been built on being in opposition of the previous coalition (Center-EKRE-Isamaa) and in being opposed to the marriage referendum , which was voted against in the Riigikogu during the
EN_334	11	In context, it would make sense for Eesti 200 to return to their previous point of emphasis, which focused on problems in Estonia's political and party system and its functioning as a whole.
EN_334	12	"""A coalition formed between two parties that are more focused on governing than ideology, which will also have the smell of corruption, offers a perfect opportunity."
EN_334	13	We can expect Eesti 200's support to go down somewhat in the coming weeks, but it will not drop as low as it was in

EN_334	15	"Mölder said it is difficult to predict the future prospects of the other parties currently: ""Reform's very high support was also mostly built on being opposed to the government."
EN_334	16	In addition, many Reform supporters will likely not like a coalition with Center.
EN_334	17	We could expect that their support could drop while in government.
EN_334	18	"And even if Center's problem is another cloud of corruption , we can predict that it will not affect their support too much, as their voters have been very loyal over the years,"" the researcher said."

EN_339	11	Throughout his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, while Scheer has vowed to roll back a federal carbon levy as his first act in office, if elected.
EN_339	12	Over the past four years the Liberals have legalised cannabis, boosted Canada’s resettlement of refugees, negotiated a new continental free trade deal with the US and Mexico, and concluded trade pacts with the EU and Pacific nations.
EN_339	13	The Trudeau government also oversaw the largest military procurement in Canadian history, to replace warships and fighter jets.
EN_339	14	But Trudeau’s political agenda was often sidelined by crises, including diplomatic and trade rows with the US, India, Saudi Arabia and China.
EN_339	15	China has detained two Canadian nationals in apparent retaliation for Canada’s arrest of a Chinese tech executive on a US warrant.
EN_339	16	As host of the 2018 G7 summit, Trudeau found himself the target of accusations of weakness and dishonesty by US President Donald Trump after the US suddenly pulled out of the joint final statement.

EN_343	1	Georgia Spending $5M for New Voting System as Lawmakers Debate More Restrictions
EN_343	2	Georgia's Secretary of State Republican Brad Raffensperger is buying a new voting system worth $5 million despite debates about voting restrictions.
EN_343	3	The new system will be bought using funding split between federal money and leftover bond funds Georgia borrowed to buy new voting machines, according to the Associated Press.
EN_343	4	The plan is for the new system to begin operating in March, and it will enhance security and make it easier to retrieve data, according to Raffensperger.
EN_343	5	The current system being used is more than 10 years old, and the AP reported that during the first few days of in-person voting in the 2020 primary elections, it was blamed for slowdowns because the system could not access data fast enough to keep up with the large volume of voters.
EN_343	6	This led to the debate of whether Raffensperger did enough to overturn President 's victory in Georgia in 2020.
EN_343	7	Joe Biden The new system, called the Georgia Registration Voter Information System, is designed to allow officials to make reports more quickly and easily access data used at polling places to access voter information.
EN_343	8	"""This new system is more advanced, more secure, and more user friendly and will give our election directors and my office new tools to better manage our election efforts,"" Raffensperger said to the Associated Press."
EN_343	9	The current system will be online as backup with the plan to make redistricting changes in the system and then transfer the data into the new system.
EN_343	10	Raffensperger said voters should see little to no change in their information.
EN_343	11	According to WALB News, Raffensperger said county and local officials around Georgia have been introduced to the new system.
EN_343	12	The officials will be trained in the coming weeks and months.

EN_343	16	The purchase of the new system comes as lawmakers are still debating voter restrictions in Georgia.
EN_343	17	According to the Georgia Recorde r , two Republican senators running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, and Raffensperger, have differing ideas of how voting should take place.
EN_343	18	Republican legislators are seeking to limit voting access, a way that voting rights groups warn is only to please those who believe the 2020 election was stolen, due to Trump's false alleges.
EN_343	19	Senator Burt Jones, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump , believes voting via touchscreen should be done away with and voting by paper should be the only way.
EN_343	20	Jones believes electronic voting has the possibility of hacking and voting by paper is safer.
EN_343	21	Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller believes the absentee voter drop box should be banned, as they are vulnerable to fraud, while Raffensperger believes there should be a constitutional amendment banning non-citizens from voting.
EN_343	22	"While this is already prohibited in Georgia, he believes ""stronger language"" is needed, the Georgia Recorder reported."
EN_348	1	Donald Trump Should Declare Martial Law, Michael Flynn Retweeted from His Now-Banned Account
EN_348	2	Trump had granted a full pardon to Michael Flynn, his first national security advisor, just eight days earlier.
EN_348	3	Flynn had already joined the Trump campaign and its most vociferous lawyerSidney Powellin promoting the wildest conspiracy theories about a stolen election.
EN_348	4	And though his December 2 tweet was a retweet, and Flynn never explicitly mentioned martial law, behind the scenes the retired Army general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency pushed Trump campaign lawyers and the president himself to use the military to intervene in the results of the vote.
EN_348	5	"Flynn, in a later Newsmax interview , said that Donald Trump had ""options"" to maintain the integrity of the election."
EN_348	6	"""The president has to plan for every eventuality because we cannot allow this election and the integrity of our election to go the way it is,'' Flynn said."
EN_348	7	"""He could immediately on his order seize every single one of these machines around the country on his order."
EN_348	8	He could also order, within the swing states, if he wanted to, he could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states.
EN_348	9	"It's not unprecedented,"" Flynn added."
EN_348	10	According to the Department of Defense Inspector General's report on the Pentagon reaction to the elections and protests, Mr.
EN_348	11	"Miller told us, ""There was absolutely no way ..."
EN_348	12	"I was putting U.S. military forces at the Capitol, period."""
EN_348	13	He cited media stories alleging that the President's advisors were pushing him to declare martial law to invalidate the election and that Mr.
EN_348	14	Miller was an ally installed as the Acting SecDef [Secretary of Defense] to facilitate a coup.
EN_348	15	He also cited a January 3, 2021 open letter from 10 former Secretaries of Defense warning the DoD not to use the military in a manner antithetical to the U.S.
EN_348	16	Constitution.
EN_348	17	"Mr. Miller stated that he ""made a very deliberate decision that I would not put U.S. military people ... East of the 9th Street, northwest. ..."
EN_348	18	"And the reason for that was I knew if the morning of the 6th or prior if we put U.S. military personnel on the Capitol, I would have created the greatest Constitutional crisis probably since the Civil War."""
EN_348	19	"In the Inspector General's report, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy supports Miller's account, saying that Miller ""made it clear that the military would not be involved in certifying the election results and that '10 different news agencies' asked him about military use and martial law."""
EN_348	20	Some critics have suggested that Flynn be arrested for sedition or even treason, that all of the plotters and even January 6 protestors who attacked police and forcibly entered the Capitol be charged with the same.
EN_348	21	What is clear is that Flynn, in his public statements, never called for martial law.
EN_348	22	He repeated others' calls and said he wasn't calling for it himself.
EN_348	23	What he said to President Trump, and what he actually said to Watnick-Cohen or Kash Patel, is still a mystery.
EN_348	24	"The law is clear: ""Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States ..."" or anyone who might ""teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence"" is guilty of sedition."
EN_348	25	"But sedition cases are rare in modern America, the proof of ""overthrowing or destroying the government"" by force of violence a high bar."
EN_348	26	Only 12 Americans have ever been successfully convicted in more than 200 yearsrarities like Aaron Burr and Jefferson Davis.
EN_348	27	So many unsuccessful government attempts to apply the seditious label have made most prosecutors gun-shy about bringing charges.
EN_348	28	Most cases have been dismissed in court because judges have ruled that encouragement and incitement, no matter how radical, is protected by the First Amendment and doesn't prove that the accused had plans for a rebellion.
EN_348	29	The last person charged with sedition, the al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn, came in 2010.
EN_348	30	Before Gadahn could be tried in a court of law, he was killed by an Obama administration drone strike in Pakistan.
EN_349	1	The Sarah Halimi affair: Killing the victim twice
EN_349	2	Halimi was a retired French doctor and schoolteacher who was attacked and killed in her apartment by her neighbour on 4 April 2017.
EN_349	3	The circumstances surrounding the murder, including the fact that Halimi was the only Jewish resident in her building, was further highlighted by the assailant shouting “Allahu Akbar” during the attack.
EN_349	4	The murderer afterward even proclaimed “I killed the Shaitan”.
EN_349	5	To the French Jewish community, this is the most poignant example of anti-Semitism in France.
EN_349	6	But for several months the French government and media refused to label the killing as anti-Semitic, drawing criticism from Jewish public figures such as Alain Finkielkraut.
EN_349	7	The government eventually acknowledged an anti-Semitic motivation for the killing, but in 2019 the assailant was declared to be not criminally responsible because he had consumed cannabis, which induced a state of psychosis.
EN_349	8	The decision was appealed to the supreme Court of Cassation, who in 2021 upheld the lower court’s ruling.
EN_349	9	In the case of Kobili Traoré, the psychiatrists were not unanimous.
EN_349	10	While some claimed that acute delirium due to absorption of cannabis had made him act in an irresponsible way, others concluded that it had caused only a slight alteration in his behaviour.
EN_349	11	Under these conditions, it was up to the court to decide, after an adversarial debate, whether he would be tried as a killer.
EN_349	12	The 65-year-old Jewish woman was savagely beaten and defenestrated from her third-floor apartment in the Belleville district of Paris.
EN_349	13	The African immigrant from Mali, reportedly became enraged following a family dispute and gained access to the neighbouring apartment of a different family, who immediately locked themselves into a bedroom, phoned police for help, and waited in fear as they listened to the intruder reciting verses from the Quran.
EN_349	14	The police initially went to the wrong building while Traoré climbed a balcony from the apartment where the family was hiding, to the apartment of Halimi, the only Jewish resident of the building.
EN_349	15	When police finally arrived at the apartment the intruder had entered first, they waited as more phone calls came in to the police emergency hotline reporting a woman screaming while a man was heard shouting “Allahu Akbar” and “I killed the Shaitan”.
EN_349	16	After throwing Halimi from a third-floor window, Traoré returned to the first apartment where the family, still cowering behind a locked door, again heard him praying aloud to Allah.
EN_349	17	Kobili Traoré, a drug dealer and drug addict, claimed insanity and was held in a psychiatric hospital, but one thing is certain: Traoré had a clear and coherent mind, during his so-called psychotic crisis, to unleash his murderous impulse on the only Jewish resident in the building.
EN_349	18	A hundred days after the killing, the suspect was still under examination for voluntary homicide, and the aggravating factor of anti-Semitism had been dropped.
EN_349	19	His criminal record included around twenty convictions for violence, theft, use or trafficking of narcotics, contempt, carrying a weapon and multiple other offences but
EN_349	20	, particular psychic.
EN_349	21	He sometimes went to the famous Omar mosque in rue Morand, “considered a temple of radical Islam”, and on the day of the murder he prayed there twice.
EN_349	22	William Attal, Sarah Halimi’s brother, told the police that his sister feared this man, who had previously called her a “dirty Jew” reported French daily le Figaro.
EN_349	23	According to Jean-Alexandre Buchinger, an attorney for the victim’s family, the killer ought to have been charged with “murder with anti-Semitism as an aggravating circumstance”, but that French Jewish groups believed that this had not been done out of fear of encouraging support for Marine Le Pen and the National Rally’s election campaign.
EN_349	24	In 2017, French writer Michel Onfray noted in a video about the silence surrounding the killing: “How can we kill this poor lady twice?
EN_349	25	By not giving this information the echo that it deserved, it was to consider that the echo of this murder counted for nothing”.
EN_349	26	He added that “whenever there is an escalation in terror, there is an escalation in the denial of terror.
EN_349	27	Every reality today is ignored and swept away ‘if it is likely to play the game of the National Front’.
EN_349	28	But reality always avenges itself one day”.
EN_349	29	Following the final decision of the supreme Court of Cassation this month, President Macron called for the law to be changed .
EN_349	30	Macron stated that France “does not judge citizens who are sick, we treat them… But deciding to take drugs and then ‘going crazy’ should not, in my opinion, take away your criminal responsibility”.
EN_349	31	Lawyers for Halimi’s family subsequently announced their intention to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

EN_357	2	"According to a by Forbes report , Google would carry out a ""keyword warrant"" in which the government would ask the company to provide all relevant Google accounts and IP addresses of those who searched certain phrases on the platform."

EN_368	6	“Oh man, everything works out, doesn’t it?
EN_368	7	… And it’s lovely to have you as a friend now… And I do love you,” Pitt replied.
EN_368	8	He continued: “One of the many things I loved about Bruce — because he did have a profound effect on me and is someone I still think about — was he really fostered your voice, your independence.
EN_368	9	“He carved the way for you guys to be who you are.
EN_368	10	And I think that’s so important to parenting.
EN_368	11	“You guys were just so free in your conversations.
EN_368	12	And witty.
EN_368	13	And intelligent… He could be tough if he needed to be, but it would be rare — only if someone was out of line.
EN_368	14	“That man was funny.
EN_368	15	He was funny.
EN_368	16	And you guys were so funny together, ripping across the table, which was a rarity that I hadn’t experienced much, and I loved it.

EN_368	18	You could just see just how much he adored you.”

EN_374	1	Keane: Manchester United players will be 'ashamed' after Anfield humiliation
EN_374	2	MANCHESTER UNITED’S PLAYERS will be “ashamed” and “embarrassed” by their performance in their record 7-0 Premier League defeat to Liverpool, according to Roy Keane.
EN_374	3	The Reds scored six times after the break to condemn United to their heaviest defeat since 1931.
EN_374	4	Cody Gakpo broke the deadlock late in the first half before two goals apiece from Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah, who became Liverpool’s record Premier League scorer, another one for Gakpo and a Roberto Firmino effort earned Liverpool their biggest-ever win over their bitter rivals.
EN_374	5	Former United skipper Keane told Sky Sports : “It’s obviously a very, very bad day, shocking day, really.
EN_374	6	The goal just before half-time and the second half.
EN_374	7	“United, the senior players were… use all the words, embarrassing, didn’t show any leadership skills, particularly the senior players.
EN_374	8	The goals they gave away were shocking.
EN_374	9	“Tough, tough day for United.
EN_374	10	Thank God, I’ve never been part of a team that’s been beaten by that much playing for Manchester United.
EN_374	11	“The players will be embarrassed, they’ll no doubt be ashamed of their performance.
EN_374	12	Particularly the second half when the going got tough, they just went missing.
EN_374	13	To give up that many goals…” Former United defender Gary Neville said: “The second half has been an absolute disgrace, a shambles, epitomised by no-one more than the captain, Bruno Fernandes, who I think has been embarrassing at times in this game.
EN_374	14	“But I have to say it’s not their usual performance, it’s not their usual spirit, it’s not their usual form and he (manager Erik Ten Hag) will deal with it, I’m sure, very quickly like he’s dealt with other difficult situations this season.”
EN_374	15	He added: “It can swallow you up here at Anfield.
EN_374	16	I’ve experienced it myself, but never to this level.
EN_374	17	You might lose 2-0, you might lose 2-1, you might lose 3-1 – you don’t lose 7-0.
EN_374	18	“You do not get beat 7-0 at Anfield if you’re a Manchester United team or player.”
EN_374	19	He said: “Liverpool were sensational in the second half.
EN_374	20	I said at half-time, treat this as a 0-0, you’ve got to win the second half, but I did not expect that.
EN_374	21	“After the second or third goal, Manchester United were just second to everything after that, and the result doesn’t flatter Liverpool.
EN_374	22	“They (United) just didn’t compete in the second half and Liverpool just ran right over them.”
EN_378	1	Tomic claimed Davis Cup captain Hewitt has favoured certain players over others.
EN_378	2	Lleyton Hewitt hit back at “clown” Bernard Tomic in an extraordinary press conference, claiming the 26-year-old has threatened and tried to blackmail him.
EN_378	3	Tomic made headlines on the opening day of the tournament with criticism of Davis Cup captain Hewitt, saying no one wanted him in the role and accusing him of favouring certain players over others.
EN_378	4	The 26-year-old named Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis as other players who felt the same.
EN_378	5	Neither backed him publicly, although Kyrgios has made sniping comments about Hewitt on social media.
EN_378	6	Bernard Tomic hit out at Lleyton Hewitt on the first day of the tournament (Nigel French/PA) After a first-round doubles defeat at Melbourne Park, Hewitt pulled no punches in his response, saying: “That is what we’ve come to expect from Bernie whatever grand slam it is, after a first-round loss he will come out with something.
EN_378	7	“We’re trying to set cultural standards for the Davis Cup and representing Australia.
EN_378	8	He hasn’t been close to those in the last couple of years.
EN_378	9	Since then I haven’t had anything to do with Bernie at all.
EN_378	10	“For me the biggest frustration is I feel like I went out of my way to help Bernie, especially when I first came into the role.
EN_378	11	He still kept making the wrong mistakes.
EN_378	12	“For me it was probably the abuse I copped from him.
EN_378	13	In the end I drew a line in the sand and haven’t spoke to him since.
EN_378	14	He won’t play Davis Cup while I have anything to do with it.
EN_378	15	Former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt is Australia’s Davis Cup captain (Dominic Lipinski/PA) “The threats I’ve received for me and my family, that I’ve had for a year and half now, I don’t think anyone would reach out to a person who speaks like that.”
EN_378	16	Hewitt said the threats were physical and that Tomic had also attempted to blackmail him over wild cards.
EN_378	17	He added: “Probably the first two years that I was in this role, Bernie and Nick were my two priorities so for Bernie to come out and have a go but more to get all his facts wrong, that’s probably the most disappointing thing.”
EN_378	18	Hewitt flatly denied Tomic’s claim that he benefited financially from the players given wild cards for the Australian Open.
EN_378	19	Hewitt added: “I don’t know why Bernie’s Bernie.
EN_378	20	I have no idea.
EN_378	21	It’s probably his upbringing.
EN_378	22	The most disappointing thing is on day one we had all these great wins by a lot of our guys and all these Bernie comments overshadow it.
EN_378	23	It’s one clown making a silly comment and that’s the main news.”
EN_378	24	Nick Kyrgios has taken swipes at Hewitt on social media (AP Photo/Aaron Favila) Hewitt took a different stance with Kyrgios, claiming the Davis Cup door is open, but is unhappy with the 23-year-old’s approach to the sport and his habit of writing incendiary social media posts.
EN_378	25	“That is one of the standards which we can’t put up with, for the culture of Australian tennis moving forward,” said the 37-year-old.
EN_378	26	“I don’t think it is a good look.
EN_378	27	I’ve spoken to Nick and he understands that.
EN_378	28	Whether he learns or not is another thing.
EN_378	29	“I’m happy to help anyone who’s willing to meet me halfway.
EN_378	30	I think you have to enjoy going out there and playing.” - Press Association.

EN_379	3	TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said the government will attempt to use international influence, including support from US President-elect Joe Biden, on the issue of the murder of Pat Finucane.
EN_379	4	Yesterday, the British government announced that no immediate public inquiry would be held into the murder, despite calls from the Finucane family and the Irish government the UK to do so.
EN_379	5	Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was not taking a public inquiry off the table, but said further examinations of the case by police and a police watchdog should conclude first.
EN_379	6	The 39-year-old solicitor, who represented both republican and loyalist paramilitaries during the Troubles, was shot dead in his family home in north Belfast in February 1989 by the Ulster Defence Association.
EN_379	7	The attack was later found to have been carried out in collusion with the state.
EN_379	8	Speaking in the Dáil today, the Taoiseach said it was “deeply, deeply disappointing” that British government has made the decision it had, adding that dealing with “legacy issues” from The Troubles has been “stop-start”.
EN_379	9	He restated the Irish government’s position that a public inquiry was needed.
EN_379	10	Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald TD said that British government is seeking to “put a dark cloak over collusion” and asked the Taoiseach whether he would bring international pressure to bear.
EN_379	11	Finucane’s son John, a solicitor and Sinn Fein MP for north Belfast, has said Biden had previously voiced support for his family’s campaign.
EN_379	12	“When he was then Senator Biden as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he supported our calls for an inquiry,” he told the BBC.
EN_379	13	“I appreciate he’s going to be in arguably the busiest role on the planet, so we aren’t we aren’t blind to that, but President-elect Biden has already shown a clear interest in Irish affairs, he has history in supporting our campaign.
EN_379	14	In the Dáil today, the Taoiseach said US support would be relied upon.
EN_379	15	“Collectively as an Oireachtas we can with one voice articulate to the British government again the view that a full public inquiry should be held,” Martin said.
EN_379	16	Speaking earlier today, Pat Finucane’s widow Geraldine has described the British government’s decision as “despicable”.
EN_379	17	Geraldine also accused British authorities of “arrogance” for ignoring a finding by the UK’s Supreme Court that all previous examinations of the killing had not been compliant with human rights standards.
EN_379	18	Geraldine Finucane and the couple’s three children have been campaigning for decades for a public inquiry to establish the extent of security force involvement.
EN_379	19	Despite the British government’s announcement yesterday, Geraldine said the Finucane family would note the decision and continue fighting on behalf of her husband.
EN_379	20	“I will never run out of road as long as there’s breath in my body,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
EN_379	21	“Today is a new day.
EN_379	22	We shall take stock and move forward.”
EN_379	23	The British and Irish governments agreed to hold a public inquiry in 2001 as part of the Weston Park agreement, but no such inquiry has ever been held.
EN_379	24	Geraldine revealed that Lewis had told her personally that British authorities had nothing to investigate and that a review of the murder might not be necessary, something she described as “bizarre”.
EN_383	1	Sunderland hire Phil Parkinson as new manager
EN_383	2	Sunderland have handed Phil Parkinson the task of dragging the club out of League One as he targets the fourth promotion of his managerial career.
EN_383	3	The 51-year-old has been appointed the new Black Cats boss on a two-and-a-half-year deal following the departure of Jack Ross earlier this month.
EN_383	4	Former Southampton, Bury and Reading midfielder Parkinson, who has achieved promotion with Colchester, Bradford and Bolton, will be assisted at the Stadium of Light by Steve Parkin.
EN_383	5	“I’ve been in football a long time now, and Sunderland’s immense history, the passion of its fanbase and its wonderful facilities are legendary within the game.
EN_383	6	“It’s now up to me to build on the work of my predecessor and deliver the success the fans are so desperate for.
EN_383	7	This is a good squad of players, and I relish the challenge of working with them to achieve our goal of promotion from League One.”
EN_383	8	Phil Parkinson took Bolton into the Championship (Barrington Coombs/PA)
EN_383	9	Sunderland missed out on promotion at the end of last season under Ross when they were beaten by Charlton in the League One play-off final at Wembley having drawn 19 of their 46 regular-season games.
EN_383	10	They currently sit ninth in the third tier, their second season in the division following back-to-back relegations from the Premier League and the Sky Bet Championship.
EN_383	11	Ross’ team had lost only two games all season and reached the last 16 in the Carabao Cup, but sections of the fanbase were unhappy with the Scot’s style of play and team selections.
EN_383	12	Jack Ross was unpopular with sections of the Sunderland fanbase (Adam Davy/PA) Chairman Stewart Donald said: “Phil has a proven track record when it comes to achieving promotion and I’m delighted to welcome him to Sunderland.
EN_383	13	“During a rigorous recruitment process, it gradually became clear that he was the prime candidate to take the club forward.
EN_383	14	His CV put him on our shortlist.
EN_383	15	His references from within the game set him apart.
EN_383	16	“I hope that Sunderland fans will all join me in welcoming him to our historic club, as we look forward to an exciting few months.”
EN_383	17	Parkinson, who left his post at crisis-torn Bolton in August after three years, met the players and took training at the Academy of Light on Thursday morning and will be in the dugout for the first time on Saturday when his team heads for Wycombe.
EN_388	1	Mona McSharry's journey from Sligo to Olympic final stardom
EN_388	2	You’ll have a good idea of how McSharry must feel this week.
EN_388	3	Maybe you caught her interviews on RTÉ or saw that bright, beaming smile as she emerged from the pool, but the same satisfaction is flowing rapidly around her hometown of Grange, Co Sligo.
EN_388	4	It’s one thing to possess the talent to make an Olympic final.
EN_388	5	It’s a whole different thing actually making it happen.
EN_388	6	Her journey into swimming happened by accident — literally.
EN_388	7	McSharry was just five years old when she fell into a lake while on holiday in Austria, her father having to jump to her rescue, after which her parents decided to enrol her in swim lessons.
EN_388	8	Two years later she began competing in the Community Games and a few years after that she won her first national title with Marlins Swim Club in Ballyshannon.
EN_388	9	That was how it began and here, in Tokyo, is not so much where it finishes as where McSharry — so long touted as the next big thing in Irish swimming — fully arrives.
EN_388	10	There’s a reason it’s been 25 years since Ireland had an Olympic finalist in swimming.
EN_388	11	It’s a very, very hard thing to achieve.
EN_388	12	Swimmers of that calibre are both born and made, needing to win the genetic lottery at birth and then needing so much more thereafter: the willingness to sacrifice so much of the average teenage life.
EN_388	13	Back in 2017, I sat down with McSharry shortly after she won the World Junior title in the 100m backstroke, the 17-year-old taking me through the routine that brought her to that point.
EN_388	14	At the time she was preparing for her Leaving Cert at Coláiste Cholmcille, the time demands of swimming forcing her to jettison a seventh subject, aware that every hour was too precious to spend any of on something that might not produce a result.
EN_388	15	She would be out the door by 5am on every school morning, lie-ins not something McSharry could entertain if she wanted to get where she was going.
EN_388	16	“You have to have that determination and drive,” she said.
EN_388	17	Her parents would taxi her on the half-hour drive to the pool, where she’d warm up for a half hour then spend the next two hours going back and forth across her 25-metre lane.
EN_388	18	“It’s a lonely sport,” she said.
EN_388	19	“But you have to deal with it and grow stronger.”
EN_388	20	She’d be back there every evening, and nights were spent catching up on homework before bedtime at no later than 10pm.
EN_388	21	Her training week would finish by 10am on a Saturday and weekends were her own, but even then there were concessions to be made compared to the average 17-year-old.
EN_388	22	“I wouldn’t be big into going out,” she said.
EN_388	23	“Maybe once or twice a year.
EN_388	24	If I do it’ll just tire me for the rest of the week.”
EN_388	25	To get to the top of her chosen sport necessitated tough decisions, and one came in 2019 when McSharry committed to enrol at the University of Tennessee, where coach Matt Kredich has since guided her career.
EN_388	26	McSharry moved there in 2020 and she made a swift impact, winning a bronze medal at the NCAA Championships.
EN_388	27	She also carved up the Irish record books and she’s now the fastest female Ireland has ever produced at 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke, along with in the 50m butterfly.
EN_388	28	In her 100m breaststroke heat in Tokyo on Sunday she breezed into the semis with 1:06.39, then came back out on Monday morning to finish fourth in her semi-final, her 1:06.59 seeing her through.
EN_388	29	It capped a remarkable rise into to the elite echelon of her sport, and seeing her achieve it and speak about what it meant — a hint of American twang now in her accent — brought back memories of that conversation in 2017.
EN_388	30	We talked then about the last great hope in Irish swimming, Gráinne Murphy, who won three gold medals at the 2009 European Juniors but who couldn’t make the same impact at senior level through no fault of her own.
EN_388	31	McSharry didn’t know Murphy but knew of her story and she was under no illusions about the breadth of the divide she had to cross.
EN_388	32	“People expect success but they don’t realise how big the jump is,” she said.
EN_388	33	“But I’m ready and excited to do it.”
EN_M_010	1	Education is fundamental to the idea of America and to fulfilling our nation’s promise.
EN_M_010	2	It is the key to addressing the challenges before us—to growing our economy, maintaining American competitiveness on the world stage, and building a more just, equitable, civically engaged, and socially conscientious nation.
EN_M_010	3	As Democrats, we believe that education is a critical public good—not a commodity—and that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that every child, everywhere, is able to receive a world-class education that enables them to lead meaningful lives, no matter their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability status, language status, immigration or citizenship status, household income or ZIP code.
EN_M_010	4	For too long, we have short-changed our children by underinvesting in our nation’s public schools and in our higher education system.
EN_M_010	5	Despite ample research showing that early childhood education can improve outcomes for students for decades to come, we still do not have universal, high-quality pre-K.
EN_M_010	6	Despite the decades-long trend that has seen more and more women entering the labor force as breadwinners, it is still far too difficult for families to secure safe and affordable child care services.
EN_M_010	7	Our public schools are bedrock community institutions, and yet our educators are underpaid, our classrooms are overstuffed, and our school buildings have been neglected, especially in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.
EN_M_010	8	Roughly six in 10 jobs require at least some education beyond high school, and yet the ever-rising cost of college tuition and fees leaves higher education out of reach—or saddles students with a lifetime of debt.
EN_M_010	9	The emergency conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic have vividly demonstrated to parents, students, and educators across the country that there is no sustainable, long-term substitute for high-quality, in-classroom learning.
EN_M_010	10	Significant gaps in access to technology, including lack of access to high-speed broadband and connected devices, have deepened inequities in our educational system for students of color, students with disabilities, English language learners, and students in rural areas and under-resourced neighborhoods during this pandemic.
EN_M_010	11	We will significantly increase federal investments in rural, urban, and Tribal broadband infrastructure to close the digital divide and ensure students can access educational resources from their homes and schools now and in the future.
EN_M_010	12	We will need increased investments in public education to help students get back on track when public health experts determine it is safe to return to schools.
EN_M_010	13	Democrats believe we can and must do better for our children, our educators, and our country.
EN_M_010	14	We are committed to making the investments our students and teachers need to build equity and safeguard humanity in our educational system and guarantee every child can receive a great education.
EN_M_010	15	To this end, we support K-12 instruction in civics and climate literacy.
EN_M_010	16	We will support evidence-based programs and pedagogical approaches, including assessments that consider the well-being of the whole student and recognize the range of ways students can demonstrate learning.
EN_M_010	17	We will reimagine our education system guided by the stakeholders and qualified, first-class, well-trained, passionate educators who know these issues best: young people, educators, parents, and community leaders.
EN_M_010	18	Democrats fundamentally believe our education system should prepare all our students—indeed, all of us—for college, careers, lifelong learning, and to be informed, engaged citizens of our communities, our country, and our planet.
EN_M_010	19	Students should have multiple public school pathways to be able to access the opportunities they deserve.
EN_M_010	20	Democrats will work to expand access to career and technical education, magnet schools for science and the arts, International Baccalaureate programs, and early college high schools to offer multiple pathways to meet the diverse needs and interests of America’s high school students.
EN_M_010	21	We will increase investments in high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs in our public schools, support access to computer science for all and improve professional development opportunities for math and science teachers, including through the creation of a national science corps of outstanding STEM teachers serving as leaders in their schools and communities.
EN_M_010	22	Democrats believe we must prioritize STEAM education and funding for underrepresented students, including students of color, girls, and low-income students, to help remove enrollment and achievement barriers.
EN_M_010	23	We will equip students with the knowledge and skills to understand complex scientific issues, counter the rising tide of denialism by promoting environmental and climate literacy, and reverse the Trump Administration's cuts to the National Environmental Education Act.
EN_M_010	24	In addition to developing strong literacy, numeracy, and STEAM skills, our education system should develop the deep learning and life skills needed to thrive in the 21st century economy, including critical and creative thinking, leadership, and judgment and decision-making.
EN_M_014	1	Europe is challenged by the moral crisis of migrants dying in their desperate efforts to reach this continent.
EN_M_014	2	The unprecedented levels of migrants and refugees fleeing war torn regions in the Middle East and North Africa remains a serious humanitarian and political challenge to Europe.
EN_M_014	3	Fianna Fáil is committed to ensuring that Ireland must play its part in assisting those in need of refuge at home and in providing help on front line camps.
EN_M_014	4	People seeking refuge here in Ireland must be afforded the supports they need to fully integrate into Irish society.
EN_M_014	5	We will: Work with our EU colleagues and international community to help address the underlying causes of the migrant crisis across the Middle East and North Africa.
EN_M_014	6	Co-operate with the EU to maintain and strengthen common borders to secure the integrity of the EU.
EN_M_014	7	Continue to support improved conditions for refugees in camps in the Middle East, including the release of further EU funding for this purpose.
EN_M_014	8	Increase Ireland’s contribution to the Trust Fund for Africa by 20%, a €3m increase.
EN_M_014	9	Stand with others in fighting against the extremists who are using this crisis to promote fear and distrust between groups.
EN_M_014	10	We will insist that Europe remains true to its democratic and inclusive values.
EN_M_014	11	Ireland has a strong and proud tradition of offering a warm welcome to visitors and has a deep historic connection to the plight of emigration from famine and fear.
EN_M_014	12	Our asylum system must reflect our values and our obligations to maintain the integrity of our borders.
EN_M_014	13	The current direct provision system fails to do that and is alienating communities across the island.
EN_M_014	14	We will: Re-focus funding away from privatisation of direct provision towards state led provision.
EN_M_014	15	Ensure that the “National Standards for Accommodation” are reviewed at least every five years.
EN_M_014	16	Provide €7m for increased resources for the hearing of asylum applications and appeals to ensure that asylum applications process times are expedited.
EN_M_014	17	Extend the remit of the Ombudsman so that he will have the power to assess why the asylum application process is taking so long and what can be done to speed it up.
EN_M_014	18	Broaden the right to work of asylum seekers by reducing the waiting period from 9 months to 6 months.
EN_M_014	19	Put in place a new €5m community integration fund that local groups can apply to with proposals to help new arrivals engage in local life.
EN_M_014	20	Enable asylum seekers to access driving licences.
EN_M_014	21	Prioritise the use of the Community Sponsorship Programme as a route of housing and integrating refugees into our communities.
EN_M_024	1	People who work hard and contribute to society should have good, fulfilling and well- paid jobs.
EN_M_024	2	Businesses and entrepreneurs who innovate and invest and behave responsibly to their employees and to the environment should be supported.
EN_M_024	3	But this is not how the UK is today: too many people can’t get on, and live secure, happy and fulfilling lives.
EN_M_024	4	The failure of governments to invest in infrastructure and skills has undermined productivity, and now the Conservatives threaten to make the vast majority of people poorer and punish business and enterprise through a hard Brexit.
EN_M_024	5	Meanwhile, we are facing profound economic changes that demand new partnerships between government and business: the emergence of artificial intelligence requires new approaches to work, and the challenge of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy must be managed in a way that does not hurt the least well-off and makes the UK more competitive.
EN_M_024	6	The UK’s strengths in science, financial services, the creative industries and high-tech manufacturing mean that we should be well placed to build an economy that treats business as part of the solution and spreads opportunity to everyone.
EN_M_024	7	Liberal Democrats are now the natural home of business: we are the only party with a new plan for a brighter economic future.
EN_M_024	8	A plan to invest in climate-friendly infrastructure and technology and create new green businesses and jobs; a plan to build on our scientific, technological and creative strengths; a plan to stop Brexit and build a more prosperous, equal and inclusive economy.
EN_M_024	9	Whichever part of the country people are from and whatever stage of their career they are at, our plan will mean greater opportunities and good, well-paid jobs.
EN_M_024	10	We want to lay the foundations for the UK to be the best place in the world for innovation-led businesses in the long-term – to be a place where people come from across the EU and the world to turn their ideas into reality.
EN_M_024	11	But with R&D and innovation investment lagging behind other countries and being overly concentrated in South East England, it needs major change to make this vision a reality.
EN_M_024	12	Only the Liberal Democrats can deliver this; the Conservatives are harking back to a romanticised imperial past, while pursuing a Brexit that will hit research and innovation, which is so dependent on European and other international collaboration, while Labour has no plan for the economy of the future.
EN_M_024	13	Liberal Democrats have a transformative plan to make the UK a world leader in responsible innovation by taking advantage of the UK’s strengths and what we are good at as a nation: our natural advantages in renewable energy; our strong university sector; and our regional strengths such as bioscience in the Midlands, advanced materials in Yorkshire, zero-carbon technology in the North West and photonics in Scotland.
EN_M_024	14	We will build a growing economy in which people will have well-paid and fulfilling jobs.
EN_M_024	15	Our ambition is for the UK to lead the world in ethical, inclusive new technology, including artificial intelligence.
EN_M_024	16	We will invest in education to equip people with the skills they need – whether to use new technology or to create it – while also attracting and welcoming the best talent from around the world.
EN_M_024	17	We will enable innovators and entrepreneurs to experiment and take risks, while taking on concentrations of power that stifle competition, limit choice for consumers and hamper progress.
EN_M_024	18	And we will ensure that new technology is developed and deployed ethically, so that it respects people’s fundamental rights, including the rights to privacy and non-discrimination.
EN_M_024	19	Business can be a force for good in our economy: we need thriving businesses to create wealth and a model of responsible capitalism generates good jobs, shares prosperity and sees businesses promote rights and protect the environment.
EN_M_024	20	But the system is not working as it should: unscrupulous employers are still able to exploit their workforce and even when businesses fail, those at the top often receive huge rewards while staff lose their jobs.
EN_M_024	21	And we do not yet have a framework that sufficiently rewards businesses for environmentally sustainable behaviour – or penalises them for environmentally damaging activities.
EN_M_024	22	Liberal Democrats will promote responsible capitalism that works for the future.
EN_M_024	23	Our plan is for an economy that works for everyone, fosters a diversity of types of business – mutuals, social enterprises and community interest companies – and empowers employees.
EN_M_025	1	The UK should be leading the world in tackling the climate emergency.
EN_M_025	2	We are the first generation to know we are destroying the environment, and the last generation with a chance to do something about it before it is too late.
EN_M_025	3	There is no Planet B.
EN_M_025	4	If we fail to act, millions of people – at home and abroad – will suffer the impacts of floods, storms and heatwaves, rising food prices and the spread of diseases; the global financial system will be destabilised, poor countries could collapse and the number of refugees will soar.
EN_M_025	5	Climate change and the collapse of natural systems are huge crises but they also represent a massive opportunity to create a different future, where people breathe clean air, drink clean water and use clean energy, where communities and industries live in harmony with nature, not at its expense.
EN_M_025	6	We need a new government with the vision and the will to seize that opportunity.
EN_M_025	7	Liberal Democrats offer a new plan to innovate our way out of crisis.
EN_M_025	8	The climate emergency can only be tackled effectively by ensuring that every relevant decision taken by national government, local councils, businesses, investors, communities and households makes progress towards the net zero objective.
EN_M_025	9	We will set a new legally binding target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045 at the latest, and implement a comprehensive climate action plan, cutting emissions across all sectors.
EN_M_025	10	Thanks to Liberal Democrat policies in government, the UK has made major strides in cutting emissions from power generation; wind power is now the cheapest form of electricity generation.
EN_M_025	11	Now we can go further: we aim to decarbonise the power sector completely, supporting renewables and household and community energy to create jobs and cut fossil fuel imports.
EN_M_025	12	We will:
EN_M_025	13	Accelerate the deployment of renewable power, providing more funding, removing the Conservatives’ restrictions on solar and wind and building more interconnectors to guarantee security of supply; we aim to reach at least 80 per cent renewable electricity in the UK by 2030.
EN_M_025	14	Expand community and decentralised energy, support councils to develop local electricity generation and require all new homes to be fitted with solar panels.
EN_M_025	15	Ban fracking because of its negative impacts on climate change, the energy mix and the local environment.
EN_M_025	16	Support investment and innovation in cutting-edge energy technologies, including tidal and wave power, energy storage, demand response, smart grids and hydrogen.
EN_M_025	17	Provide an additional £12 billion over five years to support these commitments, and ensure that the National Infrastructure Commission, National Grid, the energy regulator Ofgem, and the Crown Estate work together to deliver our net zero climate objective.
EN_M_025	18	Given the right support, British businesses have the chance to be world leaders in green technology.
EN_M_025	19	UK low-carbon businesses already have a combined turnover of £80 billion and directly employ 400,000 people, and under our proposals these will grow.
EN_M_025	20	We will provide support for innovation to cut energy and fossil fuel use in industrial processes – reducing emissions, cutting dependence on fossil fuel imports and generating jobs and prosperity.
EN_M_025	21	The successful economies of the future will be those which adopt ‘circular economy’ techniques, cutting resource use, waste and pollution by maximising recovery, reuse, recycling and remanufacturing.
EN_M_025	22	This will cut costs for consumers and businesses, protect the environment and create new jobs and enterprises.
EN_M_025	23	We will introduce a Zero-Waste and Resource Efficiency Act to ensure that the UK moves towards a circular economy.
EN_M_027	1	We are the party of a growing economy that gives everyone a chance in life, an opportunity to learn, work, and realize the prosperity freedom makes possible.
EN_M_027	2	Government cannot create prosperity, though government can limit or destroy it.
EN_M_027	3	Prosperity is the product of self-discipline, enterprise, saving and in­ vestment by individuals, but it is not an end in itself.
EN_M_027	4	Prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government , raise their children by their own values , practice their faith, and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect.
EN_M_027	5	It is also the foundation for our nation's global leadership, for it is the vigor of our economy which makes possible our military strength and our national security.
EN_M_027	6	Republicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative.
EN_M_027	7	More than any other public policy, the way government raises revenue - how much, at what rates, under what circumstances, from whom, and for whom - has the greatest impact on our economy 's performance.
EN_M_027	8	It powerfully in­ fluences the level of economic growth and job creation, which translates into the level of opportunity for those who would otherwise be left behind.
EN_M_027	9	Getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity.
EN_M_027	10	Our proposal is straightforward.
EN_M_027	11	Wherever tax rates penalize thrift or discourage investment, they must be lowered.
EN_M_027	12	Wherever current provisions of the code are disincentives for economic growth, they must be changed.
EN_M_027	13	We will not divide the American people into winners and losers.
EN_M_027	14	We will eliminate as many special interest provisions and loopholes as possible and curb corporate welfare, especially where their erosion of the tax base has created pressure for higher rates.
EN_M_027	15	We will be mindful of the burdens on families with children and the impact on an aging population.
EN_M_027	16	We will seek simplicity and clarity so that every taxpayer can understand how much of their income is consumed by the federal government.
EN_M_027	17	We will welcome all to this enterprise - to discuss, debate, challenge, and amend - so that together we can restore economic growth for the American people and, even more important, renew their faith in the future.
EN_M_027	18	Competitiveness equals jobs.
EN_M_027	19	That equation governs our policies regarding U.S. corporations in the global economy.
EN_M_027	20	Private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation.
EN_M_027	21	After falling dramatically during the recession, private investment has recovered at a disappointing pace due in part to high corporate tax rates and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty.
EN_M_027	22	American businesses now face the world's highest corporate tax rates.
EN_M_027	23	That's like putting lead shoes on your cross-country team.
EN_M_027	24	It reduces com­ panies' ability to compete overseas, encourages them to move abroad, lessens their investment, cripples job creation here at home, lowers American wages, and fosters the avoidance of tax liability - without actually increasing tax revenues.
EN_M_027	25	A more damaging policy is hard to imagine.
EN_M_027	26	We propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with, or below, the rates of other industrial nations.
EN_M_027	27	We endorse the recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as the current Administration's Export Council, to switch to a territorial system of taxation so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for job-creating investment here at home.
EN_M_027	28	We believe American companies should be headquartered in America.
EN_M_027	29	We should reduce barriers to accomplishing that goal.
EN_M_027	30	International trade is crucial for all sectors of America's economy.
EN_M_027	31	Massive trade deficits are not.
EN_M_027	32	"We envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets, what has been called a ""Reagan Economic Zone,"" in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned."
EN_M_027	33	We need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first.
EN_M_027	34	When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democra­ cies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports.
EN_M_027	35	When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. inter­ ests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected.
EN_M_027	36	We cannot allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology.
EN_M_027	37	We cannot allow China to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of U.S. products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports.
EN_M_027	38	The current Administration's way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender.
EN_M_027	39	Republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it.
EN_M_027	40	A Republican president will insist on parity in trade and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate.
EN_M_027	41	At the same time, we look to broaden our trade agreements with countries which share our values and commitment to fairness, along with transparency in our commercial and business practices.
EN_M_027	42	In pursuing that objective, the American people demand transparency, full disclosure, protection of our national sovereignty, and tough negotiation on the part of those who are supposed to advance the interests of U.S. workers.
EN_M_027	43	Significant trade agreements should not be rushed or undertaken in a Lame Duck Congress.
EN_M_033	1	AN OPEN MODERN ECONOMY
EN_M_033	2	We want Scotland to be the best place to live, work and do business.
EN_M_033	3	We believe that Scotland should be able to emulate the performance of the most successful small countries in the world.
EN_M_033	4	To do that we need the powers of independence and the right economic strategy.
EN_M_033	5	We believe that strategy must be founded on the three P’s of population, participation and productivity.
EN_M_033	6	We must grow our population, we must tackle inequality and improve participation, and we must increase the productivity of our economy.
EN_M_033	7	The SNP will always promote policies that reflect the needs of Scotland’s businesses and economy while putting fair work at the heart of everything we do.
EN_M_033	8	In government, we have created a National Manufacturing Institute which will be the centre of excellence for manufacturing in Scotland and launched the Scottish National Investment Bank which will invest in Scottish businesses and help to grow our economy.Unlike successive Westminster governments, we will never turn our back on Scottish industry.
EN_M_033	9	We have stepped in to secure a future for Scottish Steel, Pinney’s, BiFab and more recently, Ferguson’s shipyard – taking it into public control.
EN_M_033	10	But a fair society isn’t just about the right to work, it must be about the right to fair work.
EN_M_033	11	That is why in Government we have launched ‘Fair Work First’ – championing the Real Living Wage, opposing exploitative zero hours contracts and ensuring that companies that want grants from government sign up to fair work principles.
EN_M_033	12	Scotland now has the highest rate of workers in the UK earning not just the UK mandatory living wage, but the real Living Wage.
EN_M_033	13	We will call on the UK Government to adopt our Fair Work First approach.
EN_M_033	14	Despite Westminster’s Brexit mess, Scottish firms continue to export more and more to the world.
EN_M_033	15	Scottish business is not standing still and Westminster must now do its part by supporting measures to boost productivity.
EN_M_033	16	A key lever of improving productivity comes from city and region deals which can improve connectivity, innovation and productivity.
EN_M_033	17	However, Westminster has underfunded Scottish deals to the tune of £400 million – failing to match the level of investment being made by the Scottish Government.
EN_M_033	18	SNP MPs will demand the UK stops short-changing Scotland on city and region deals, urge the UK Government to deliver for all of Scotland through an early agreement to deliver Growth Deals for those areas of Scotland yet to receive them, and make up the shortfall in their investment in existing deals.
EN_M_033	19	Investment in modern physical and digital infrastructure is vital to a thriving, productive economy in the 21st Century.
EN_M_033	20	In Government, the SNP has recognised this through the National Infrastructure Mission which will see an additional £7 billion invested in Scotland over the period to 2026.
EN_M_033	21	The creation of the Scottish National Investment Bank will provide £2 billion of long term, patient capital to businesses and infrastructure projects that will help transform the Scottish economy and reduce our carbon emissions.
EN_M_033	22	To ensure public projects serve the public interest we are currently conducting work on the establishment of a National Infrastructure Company – an idea that puts fair working conditions at the heart of public infrastructure projects.
EN_M_033	23	The SNP has led the way in promoting improved social responsibility and corporate culture, not least through the Scottish Business Pledge.
EN_M_033	24	This partnership between Government and business is based on boosting productivity and competitiveness through fairness, equality, environmental action and sustainable employment.
EN_M_033	25	It is a commitment to fairness – including mandatory elements such as paying the living wage, closing the gender pay gap and not using exploitative zero-hours contracts.
EN_M_033	26	By bringing these together companies across Scotland have shown they can improve productivity and competitiveness and build sustainable growth that also achieves fairness, equality, opportunity and innovation.
EN_M_033	27	At Westminster, the SNP will further support the growing trend in the private sector towards greater corporate responsibility.
EN_M_033	28	By taking a greater stake in the communities within which they operate, firms can become partners for social progress.
EN_M_033	29	Whilst it is always better to work collaboratively as partners, the SNP supports direct intervention when firms fail to meet their legal and social obligations.
EN_M_033	30	SNP MPs will back moves to increase worker representation on company boards – a practice common place amongst our more productive, investment-rich European competitors and one that we believe will promote a greater social responsibility amongst companies.We will also argue for greater representation of women and minority communities on public and private sector boards.
EN_M_033	31	In Scotland, the public sector is on track to ensure that all public boards have 50-50 gender balance by 2020 due to statutory targets we put in place.
EN_M_033	32	We would support similar UK legislation for the private sector.
EN_M_033	33	The evidence shows that companies and organisations do better when they properly represent society.
EN_M_034	1	Ireland’s economy is based primarily on the value of our people.
EN_M_034	2	It is driven forward by our creative, ambitious entrepreneurs, made competitive by our smart, capable workers and depends on talented, energetic young graduates.
EN_M_034	3	Successive governments have consistently failed to live up to the ambition, passion and confidence of our entrepreneurs and our workforce.
EN_M_034	4	For too long our industrial policy has been a defensive posture, focused on “holding what we have” rather than looking at how we can grow our economy with confidence over the next 10 or 20 years.
EN_M_034	5	We know that it is difficult to predict exactly what the global economy will look like in 20 years’ time.
EN_M_034	6	However, it is reasonable to assume there will continue to be a fast pace of change, with resulting challenges and opportunities for our relatively small, relatively open economy.
EN_M_034	7	We believe that our medium term strategy should be to invest heavily in the development of a highly skilled and flexible workforce, and to increase supports for new and existing companies to allow them to grow from Ireland, rather than needing to leave Ireland to grow.
EN_M_034	8	We are committed to improving equality and access in education.
EN_M_034	9	This will harness the full potential of the Irish Workforce by helping to bring the best out of our people.
EN_M_034	10	We are committed to reducing the cost of living through policies in key areas such as housing, health and energy.
EN_M_034	11	This will help to ensure that Ireland remains attractive as a place to come to work (a factor that has been key in Ireland’s recent hi-tech industry boom) and as a place to employ people.
EN_M_034	12	We are committed to tackling corruption in Ireland through the establishment of an independent anti- corruption agency.
EN_M_034	13	This will help our best businesses thrive through honest competition based on merit.
EN_M_034	14	We are committed to tackling Ireland’s infrastructure deficit.
EN_M_034	15	The building of new transport networks, upgrading educational institutes, providing high speed broadband to the whole country and putting in place the local services required to build thriving communities are all essential to promoting a positive business climate in Ireland.
EN_M_034	16	The above policies are part of an observed virtuous cycle in socially democratic economies – by investing to provide the environment where businesses can succeed, we in turn get economic growth.
EN_M_034	17	This growth funds social investment back into a highly educated workforce, transport and broadband infrastructure, affordable housing and supports for new and growing companies.
EN_M_034	18	For this reason, social democratic countries are the best places to start and grow businesses.
EN_M_034	19	At present in Ireland, we have the opposite – a downward spiral of underinvestment in both education and entrepreneurship.
EN_M_034	20	Expensive childcare, rents and insurance is putting pressure on wages.
EN_M_034	21	Underinvestment in broadband and connectivity is hurting our international competitiveness.
EN_M_034	22	If this continues it is likely that our economy will diminish over time; we will be less able to fund investment in these areas; and we will find we are less able to maintain a high value economy.
BG_005	1	Balkanka Association:
BG_005	2	98% of hydropower plants in the country violate laws
BG_005	3	98% of hydropower plants in the country violate the laws of the country and the EU, 68% have serious violations, 76% of all hydropower plants are in NATURA 2000.
BG_005	4	About 170 new hydropower plants have been built since 2000, and there are now about 260 operating.
BG_005	5	"This was announced by the association ""Balkanka"" at a briefing on the situation with the water and hydropower plants in the country."
BG_005	6	"""The good condition of the rivers is extremely important for the drinking sources themselves, as the water in the river and the water in the groundwater are hydraulically connected, and if a river is polluted, it inevitably pollutes the groundwater from where the water is drawn,"" said Dimitar Kumanov from the association."
BG_005	7	He gave the example of r.
BG_005	8	Struma in Pernik.
BG_005	9	In 2019, there were over 10 instances where the river flowed in different colors of the rainbow.
BG_005	10	"On the occasion of the dam. ""Coldena, he added that in 2018 there were 10 million cubic meters of water in the reservoir, in June 2018 there were 18 million cubic meters, which means that in 2018 the snowmelt resulted in 8 million cubic meters filling."
BG_005	11	In January 2019, there were 10 million cubic meters in the dam, the same as in June that year, so 8 million cubic meters have disappeared somewhere.
BG_005	12	Kumanov added that it is obvious that many businesses are using the moment to purge themselves of all the poisons they have accumulated, adding that a lot of water is needed for this purpose.
BG_005	13	He stressed that the RIEW-Pernik and the Basin Directorate-Blagoevgrad have been called for these illegal practices, but the answer follows that everything is normal.
BG_005	14	"""All this goes to the Pchelina dam all year round"", Dimitar Kumanov is adamant."
BG_005	15	He reminded that since 2016 the dam has been connected to the lake.
BG_005	16	"""Bee"" is hooked up a brand new hydroelectric power plant."

BG_014	4	Here is what the text read by Gyurov says: The Coalition, taking into account the systemic erosion of the rule of law due to corruption at the highest levels of power and the lack of effective investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office; finds that the actions of the Prosecutor General differ from best practices in Europe; taking into account the systematic recommendations of the EU; taking into account the recommendations and standards of the Venice Commission; taking into account that according to the Corruption Perception Index our country is one of the last in the EU; taking into account the low confidence in the Prosecutor's Office in Bulgaria; taking into account the selective activation of the

BG_014	7	"Worried by the growing discontent against the government of Kiril Petkov, advised by the PR of the party formation Diana Damyanova, ""The Change"" issued a statement demanding the resignation of the Attorney General."
BG_014	8	The declaration was considered to be presented from the rostrum of the Parliament or to be submitted as a special item to the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of the National Assembly.
BG_014	9	Damyanova, who used to be the PR of Lukoil's representative for Bulgaria Valentin Zlatev, advised Kiril Petkov to confront Geshev in order to divert public attention from the growing crises.

BG_014	11	The lack of a budget for 2022 would be felt very soon and the government had no vision what the policies in the future budget would be.

BG_020	1	GERB are looking for a peacemaker for president, they are ready with Slavi's people to govern
BG_020	2	GERB is delaying with the nomination of the presidential candidate because we want to find the best option, who is both electable and at the same time, if he takes office, to be able to solve the political crisis and not to deepen it.
BG_020	3	"This is what MP Toma Bikov said in ""Hello, Bulgaria"" on Nova TV."
BG_020	4	We want to elect a presidential candidate who is an alternative to Rumen Radev.
BG_020	5	We are not going to broadcast a strongman to take on our opponents.
BG_020	6	We want to elect a person who from day one will have a conversation with our biggest political opponents and try to see if we can find some important points for Bulgaria.
BG_020	7	"There are several options for such a person,"" he added."
BG_020	8	The name of Petar Stoyanov as a presidential candidate appeared yesterday after my participation in BNR.
BG_020	9	Asked what I thought of him, I said what I thought, this is the most successful Bulgarian president to date, a man who has brought the country back from the brink of civil war.
BG_020	10	"This is what I say now"", commented Binev."
BG_020	11	Before all the presidential elections since 2001 Stoyanov's name is always part of the discussions of the right.
BG_020	12	Including now.
BG_020	13	This name is swirling in the public domain.
BG_020	14	"It is normal for anyone who is concerned about giving an alternative to Rumen Radev to discuss the candidacy of Petar Stoyanov,"" he added."
BG_020	15	The option Boyko Borissov to be a candidate is discussed in all presidential elections.
BG_020	16	"At the moment he is dealing with the party"", the Burgas resident stressed."
BG_020	17	Borissov's candidacy would be the easiest option to mobilise supporters.
BG_020	18	But then we will have to decide who will take over the party.
BG_020	19	He still has some time with GERB and there will be presidential elections after this one.
BG_020	20	"He may serve another term as prime minister,"" he stressed."
BG_020	21	The situation after the elections will be more complicated than at the moment.
BG_020	22	This is the trend.
BG_020	23	On 4 April it was relatively easy because everyone was against GERB.
BG_020	24	Now everyone is against everyone.
BG_020	25	"After November 14, it may be all against all, but there will be new players, whom we are still getting to know"", said Bikov."
BG_020	26	When asked whether GERB and There is Such a Nation could rule us after the elections, he replied that anything could happen.
BG_020	27	If we are involved in such negotiations, I am convinced that they will go in a very different way from what we have seen the last two times.
BG_020	28	We will neither insult them nor waste time with general talk about judicial reform, which no one knows what it will be.
BG_020	29	"These were the negotiations,"" the MP added."
BG_025	1	The deputies decided:
BG_025	2	Machine voting abolished only for local elections
BG_025	3	Machine voting will not only be available in local elections.
BG_025	4	This was finally adopted by the MPs when voting on the second reading of the controversial amendments to the Electoral Code.
BG_025	5	GERB's original project envisaged voting with devices to be only in presidential and European elections, but a day ago the party of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov took a step back
BG_025	6	-
BG_025	7	Only the BSP MPs were against the restriction of the machine vote.
BG_025	8	Until recently, they insisted on having devices in all types of elections.
BG_025	9	The MRF, which was also against the abolition, a day ago remained satisfied with GERB's concession and supported it in the final vote in the plenary.They justified their decision to support the restriction by saying that the abolition of the machines only for local elections was a step forward from the original idea.
BG_025	10	The Socialists accused GERB of trying to secure a provisional victory in the local elections.
BG_025	11	"""You started with the one lev, now we are going to the machine voting."
BG_025	12	This is your essence.
BG_025	13	"You are redistributing power and you want to ensure your victory in the upcoming parliamentary elections through the local government,"" Dragomir Stoynev told the ruling party during the debate."
BG_025	14	The BSP once again launched the thesis that it is at local elections that there should be devices to facilitate people.
BG_025	15	According to GERB, however, if there is machine voting in the autumn, it will lead to difficulties and may even vitiate the electoral process.
BG_025	16	Until now, the Electoral Code envisaged the upcoming local elections to be the last ones with paper ballots and from next year all elections to be held by machine only.
BG_025	17	There were supposed to be 6,000 machine voting devices in the fall.
BG_025	18	These texts were adopted five months ago at the proposal of the MRF and with the support of GERB.
BG_025	19	Two weeks ago, however, Borissov's party decided to change the texts again and to abolish machine voting in parliamentary and local elections.
BG_025	20	On Tuesday, during the meeting of the legal committee, GERB decided to leave the devices in the elections for deputies.
BG_025	21	Then the decision was explained by a debate in the largest party group itself.
BG_025	22	"During the debate on Wednesday, another explanation was presented: aware of the responsibility we have as the largest parliamentary political force and as a mandate holder for holding legitimate local elections, we allowed a retreat from the original proposal"", explained the chairwoman of the GERB parliamentary group Daniela Daritkova."
BG_025	23	New amendments to the Electoral Code after the local elections.
BG_025	24	Already during the committee meeting, the MRF remained satisfied with the retreat, but vowed to amend the Electoral Code after the local elections to introduce machine counting of paper ballots as well.
BG_025	25	A day later GERB embraced this idea.
BG_025	26	"""We will do our best to reopen the Electoral Code after the local elections and look for solutions to ensure a transparent electoral process overcoming the imperfections of the machine voting,"" Daritkova said."
BG_025	27	From her words it was understood that the largest party was ready for a debate on the issue of the introduction of machine counting.
BG_025	28	"""We can discuss the topic of machine counting or correct reporting of election results."
BG_025	29	We will fix all the problems that have been created in the Electoral Code over time.
BG_025	30	"It has been repeatedly fixed, patched up to produce something that we now really need to rethink, reconsider, but within the framework of a calm procedure after local elections, which we need to ensure are conducted in a way that does not lead to endless contestation of the result and questioning of their legitimacy,"" she added."
BG_025	31	"Then Daritkova called on ""all nationally responsible political forces"" to ""take the outstretched hand"" of GERB."
BG_029	1	The Union of Judges accused the SJC of destroying the rule of law
BG_029	2	"The Union of Judges in Bulgaria (UJB) made harsh accusations against the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) because of the position with which the institution condones the pressure on the magistrates in the Polfreeman case"" instead of defending the independence of the court."
BG_029	3	A day ago, the Judicial College of the Supreme Judicial Council issued a statement on a signal submitted by IMRO.
BG_029	4	In its alert, the nationalist party is demanding that action be taken against the three judges who released murder convict Jock Polfreeman from prison early.
BG_029	5	The IMRO's alert says that the judicial panel that released the Australian citizen was not impartial and undermined the prestige of the judiciary.
BG_029	6	"The SJC responded with a position that it could not interfere in the court's decisions, but noted that it ""shares the feeling of the relatives of (Polfreeman's murder victim) Andrei Monov that the balance between law and justice has been disturbed""."
BG_029	7	Judges Kalin Kalpakchiev, Vesislava Ivanova and Violeta Magdalincheva are members of the panel of the Sofia Court of Appeals.
BG_029	8	The decision in the Polfreeman case was unanimous.
BG_029	9	Judge Kalpakchiev is President of the Union of Judges in Bulgaria, Judge Vesislava Ivanova is a member of the organization.
BG_029	10	They have been the object of a brutal media attack and the subject of a number of political statements.
BG_029	11	The SJC, however, sided with those who attacked the judiciary.
BG_029	12	Now the entire leadership of the Union of Judges (without the participation of Kalin Kalpakchiev) accuses the SJC of not fulfilling its main duty to defend the independence of the court.
BG_029	13	"""Not only are you not fulfilling this basic duty, but you are joining an unprecedented political and public pressure on a particular judicial staff and the judiciary as a whole, which is unceremoniously exploiting, for different reasons and for different purposes, the tragedy of a Bulgarian family."
BG_029	14	"In this way you are destroying the basic foundations of the rule of law - the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary"", the position of the largest judges' organisation says."
BG_029	15	The SJB reminds the Trial Chamber that the decision in any case is to be based on the law and the evidence gathered under due process.
BG_029	16	"""In this regard, it is unacceptable for the members of the SJC to 'share a sense of disturbed balance between law and justice' on a particular judicial act expressed by citizens, groups of citizens or political parties."
BG_029	17	"The procedure for challenging and annulling judicial acts is precisely and clearly stated in the law,"" the Union of Judges said."
BG_029	18	"The organisation says that debate on judicial decisions is desirable in a democratic society, but ""personal attacks and threats against the judge or the panel of judges that issued the relevant judicial decision, including physical self-harm, are absolutely unacceptable""."
BG_029	19	"""It is precisely in such cases that the judge must receive unquestioning and firm support from the institution called by law to do so, the Supreme Judicial Council, because only in this way the rule of law and the independence of the court are affirmed,"" the organisation said."
BG_029	20	"The SJC says that instead of protection, the Bulgarian judge receives a sign from the SJC that ""if he does not rule in accordance with public opinion and the wishes of political parties and their specific leaders, he will be slandered, defamed, physically persecuted and abused, and the only reaction of the SJC will be to assist in his disciplinary prosecution."""
BG_029	21	The organisation tells the members of the College of Judges that if they cannot perform their basic duties under the law, they can always resign.
BG_034	1	The BSP accused the RIA of delaying the independent...
BG_034	2	The job of the Chairman of the RIA Board is to repair and build safe roads and to introduce the toll system, not to get into political games.
BG_034	3	This was said by the Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian BSP for Bulgaria Georgi Svilensky during a press conference at the party headquarters, reported a reporter of Focus News Agency.
BG_034	4	Svilensky pointed out that the chairman of the RIA repeatedly engaged in political games.
BG_034	5	"""In the last two days we have seen an attempt by the representatives of the Road Infrastructure Agency and our fellow MPs from GERB to once again cover up or close the case with our requested inspection,"" Svilensky said."
BG_034	6	"He gave the chronology of the BSP initiative. ""On November 2, 2018, more than half of the parliamentary group of BSP for Bulgaria, not to say the whole group, signed a request for permission for an independent expert examination by an independent European laboratory from the RIA."
BG_034	7	"This is how it should be"", Svilensky said."
BG_034	8	He added that the reply was given by the RIA on December 4, saying to name the party's road experts and give the name of the laboratories , to get in touch with them to decide what to do.
BG_034	9	"""Elena Yoncheva said a moment ago."
BG_034	10	If, on 4 December, we provide the experts, the names of these people and the laboratories, surely none of us have any doubt what pressure and what they will be subjected to and what methods will be used against them to carry out this inspection.
BG_034	11	"We ask for the permit, then we immediately submit it to the independent European laboratory, it carries out the analyses, compares them with the designs as they were and comes before you and says: ""Dear Bulgarian citizens, the roads were designed this way, they were built this way, they are currently in this condition - you decide whether there is a violation""."
BG_034	12	Moving on, March 15 we are sending a letter specifying the sections because the previous letter said to specify them.
BG_034	13	We say, well, let them know where they went wrong.
BG_034	14	We give them 46 points of Bulgarian highways that we think have a problem.
BG_034	15	"This happens on March 15, on May 2 we receive a letter from the chairman of the RIA Board, in which he says: ""Given the large number of sections for which the documentation is requested, and given the fact that some of the sections listed - Hemus, Trakia - were built in the 1980s, but were repaired until 5 years ago, additional time is needed to prepare and organize the requested documentation for all the sections listed."
BG_034	16	"In view of the above, additional time is required for the information provided to you."""
BG_034	17	We literally take it as a normal response.
BG_034	18	"They need more time - they are not yet clear what to do"", Svilensky added."
BG_034	19	The deputy chairman of the BSP for Bulgaria group pointed out that on 13 May the chairman of the Management Board took a decision granting full access to the requested public information available in the RIA.
BG_034	20	However, he said, the MPs can consult it in the archives of the RIA.
BG_034	21	"""We want permission to carry out an expert examination and once it is done, then we want the documentation, but not in the archives of the RIA, but handed over in due order as MPs,"" Svilensky said."
BG_034	22	He stressed that Article 141 of the Rules of Procedure and Work of the National Assembly, which has the force of law, states that state and local authorities and their administration are obliged to provide assistance to the MP and to provide information on documents in connection with the exercise of powers.
BG_034	23	"""It is not writing to invite him to the archives of the RIA to read the documents"", Svilensky further stressed."

BG_041	4	"This was said by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of ""Information Services"" prof."
BG_041	5	Mikhail Konstantinov during a meeting convened by President Rumen Radev with representatives of the CEC, responsible institutions and analysts of the electoral process in connection with the conduct and organization of local elections this year, a reporter of the Focus news agency reported.
BG_041	6	According to Mikhail Konstantinov, a lot of wrong data was heard about the local elections.
BG_041	7	"""Because a lot of people were quick to speak up,"" he noted."
BG_041	8	Prof. Konstantinov pointed out that there was practically no difference in the invalid votes in the 2015 elections compared to this year's.
BG_041	9	"""In 2015 the percentage was 8.7% and 14% for municipal councilors, 2011 - 5.7% invalid."
BG_041	10	And for councillors only 6%.
BG_041	11	There is a strange spike between 2011 and 2015.
BG_041	12	"One of the hypotheses is that people do not get the preferences right,"" he added."
BG_041	13	Konstantinov summarized the data, pointing out that the least number of invalid ballots was in Sofia - 5%, and the most in Vidin - 23%.
BG_041	14	"""In Varna - 11%."
BG_041	15	In Kardzhali - 14%, below the national average.
BG_041	16	"In Montana - 21%,"" he added."
BG_041	17	The recommendation is to open a sufficient number of sacks and to take legal and organisational measures I am sure we can bring this percentage down.
BG_041	18	On President Radev's proposal to introduce machine voting, Konstantinov noted that according to recent surveys 24% of Bulgarians have not used the internet, which, in his words, will not allow them to cope with this way of voting.
BG_041	19	"""Some of the Bulgarian voters have not used a computer, when we make some good proposals, it is good to know that,"" the professor added."
BG_041	20	President Radev replied that he rather sees the machine voting as working with an ATM that everyone knows well and that the use of the internet has nothing to do with the process.
BG_041	21	The polling agencies and the media violate the law on a massive scale at election time, there should be a greater severity of penalties for corporate and bought votes.
BG_041	22	This is what President Rumen Radev said during a meeting he convened with representatives of the CEC, responsible institutions and analysts of the electoral process in connection with the conduct and organization of the local elections this year, a reporter of Focus news agency reported.
BG_041	23	The big problems and challenges are the corporate and bought vote.
BG_041	24	The law is being broken on a massive scale.
BG_041	25	This impresses everyone.
BG_041	26	Whether it's conscious or not, there are huge discrepancies in the exit poll with reality, and that affects people's vote.
BG_041	27	"This is unacceptable and there should be a serious reaction here,"" the Head of State added."
BG_041	28	Rumen Radev pointed to corporate and bought votes as another problem facing the electoral process.
BG_041	29	"""The most difficult thing is to overcome this vote."
BG_041	30	If we look at the statistics and reports from the SANS, the Ministry of Interior and the prosecutor's office, there are no significant differences between the local elections of 2015 and 2019, but looking at all that the experts summarise, the feeling in the people is that there is an industry going on here for tens of millions.
BG_041	31	It is shameful that this is happening in a European country in the 21st century.
BG_041	32	We need to move towards a definite increase in the severity of penalties: both administrative and criminal.
BG_041	33	"We have to look at whether we are going to change the ratio and how we are going to classify them: which are administrative offences, which are criminal offences, because this is a crime against democracy,"" he said."
BG_041	34	In conclusion, the President noted that the holding of the meeting was important because not only democracy but also the legitimacy of the government and the institutions depend on the fairness and transparency of the elections.

BG_042	3	Tenyo Enchev will serve a 25-year prison sentence for the murder of his 19-year-old girlfriend in 2018 in the town of Kiev. Aitos.
BG_042	4	This was made clear by a ruling of the SCC.
BG_042	5	It is final.
BG_042	6	The SCC has received notification from a prosecutor that action has been taken to enforce the sentence imposed by the court.
BG_042	7	The case was initiated on cassation appeals by the defendant Tenyo Enchev and his counsel against the decision of the Court of Appeal - Burgas, which upheld the verdict of the District Court - Burgas.
BG_042	8	The defendant was found guilty of murder, committed in a particularly painful way for the deceased and with particular cruelty, as the act was committed under conditions of dangerous recidivism.
BG_042	9	For this he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment.
BG_042	10	He was ordered to pay the civil claimants the sums of BGN 150 000 and BGN 200 000, representing compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the death of their relative.
BG_042	11	He was also ordered to pay compensation for material damages in the amount of BGN 3,000 resulting from the tort.
BG_042	12	The three-member chamber of the SCC emphasizes in its reasoning that at a hearing on 30.01.2019 the defendant Enchev and his counsel have requested the Burgas District Court to hear the case under the procedure of summary investigation.
BG_042	13	The offender has fully admitted the facts and circumstances set out in the indictment.
BG_042	14	There is no evidence that this was not done voluntarily without his understanding the nature of the procedure and its consequences.
BG_042	15	It was held that his self-confession was supported by the evidence in the case, and lawfully so.
BG_042	16	"""In view of all that has been stated, this court will not consider the objections raised both in the defence counsel's cassation appeal and defended at the hearing before the SCC, relating to incorrect analysis of evidence, lack of reasoning, and the lengthy account given by the cassation appellant himself in his personal appeal and one of the appendices thereto, of the facts of the criminal conduct as he saw them,"" the chief justices said."
BG_042	17	They emphasise that the focus of the ruling is on the content of the indictment and the facts and circumstances reflected therein, reflecting on the application of the substantive law, as well as the decision taken in this respect by the deciding courts.
BG_042	18	According to the defence, there is no evidence for the accepted presence of the qualifying circumstance under Art. 1(6)(2) and (3) of the Criminal Code, therefore the material law was violated by sentencing the defendant under this text.
BG_042	19	The three-member Chamber of the SCC held that this did not correspond to the procedural reality.
BG_042	20	"The facts set out in the indictment, accepted by the courts, in accordance with the reference made by the representative of the public prosecution to the relevant evidence, establish categorically the presence of the qualifying elements of murder ""committed in a particularly painful manner for the deceased and with particular cruelty""."
BG_042	21	All this is admitted by the offender and he and his defence cannot challenge the evidence in this regard.
BG_042	22	The foregoing is entirely true with respect to the claim of lack of intent in causing death.
BG_042	23	"""The overall development of Enchev's behaviour, leading to the escalation of the violence against the victim, as described in the indictment, does not allow for any reflection on the presence of reckless guilt in relation to the death that occurred,"" the SCC judges said."
BG_042	24	According to the defense, the defendant did not intend to kill the victim, but wanted to punish her as he saw fit for behaving in a morally reprehensible and inappropriate manner toward their son by blowing cigarette smoke directly into the child's face.
BG_042	25	Such a fact is suggested by the defendant himself.
BG_042	26	"The reasoning of the SCC says: ""However, there is a lack of such among the facts on the charging instrument."
BG_042	27	On the contrary, it categorically reflects that the victim in no way provoked the violence against herself.
BG_042	28	And this is exactly what the perpetrator has admitted under Article 371(2) et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
BG_042	29	"Not to mention that because of the particular manifestation of Enchev's actions, the claim could hardly be reasoned on the plane of lack of intent, even if the fact treated were accepted."""
BG_042	30	The three-judge Chamber of the SCC held that the damages for non-pecuniary loss awarded to the victim's child and her mother were also correctly assessed.
BG_048	1	Minister Nikolina Angelkova:
BG_048	2	"Teams of the Ministry of Tourism carry out inspections related to the category ""five stars"""
BG_048	3	With the start of the summer season, our active inspections started everywhere on the Black Sea coast, both in terms of beaches and accommodation.
BG_048	4	We are here to check on a signal we have received on our phone from tourists that there are certain violations in the Emerald Resort complex in Ravda.
BG_048	5	"This is what the Minister of Tourism Nikolina Angelkova told journalists, Radio ""Focus"" - Burgas reporter."
BG_048	6	"""Our colleagues from the control directorate made an inspection and it was found that there are violations related to non-compliance with the requirements of the ordinance for the category ""five stars"", Angelkova said."
BG_048	7	She clarified that one is related to the fact that the alarm system, which is extremely important for the safety of people and tourists, does not work and therefore there are additional requirements from the equipment in the rooms, which does not meet the requirements for five stars.
BG_048	8	"""We are going to issue prescriptions so that these violations can be corrected, respectively imposing a fine of 1 000 to 3 000 leva depending on the severity of the violation,"" Angelkova said."
BG_048	9	She added that if the prescriptions are not fulfilled within these 30 days and the violations are not corrected, they will demand a downgrading of the hotel to make sure that the quality and requirements of the Tourism Act and the Accommodation Categorization Ordinance are met.
BG_048	10	Regarding the hygiene-related signal, the director of the Regional Food Safety Directorate, Dr. Georgi Mitev, said that no violations were found.
BG_048	11	"""The total number of sites under our control in the whole complex is 6."
BG_048	12	"We found no violations regarding hygiene and registration,"" Mitev added."
BG_048	13	He said four of the outlets are leased, they are registered with them, and two of the outlets are operated by the company, which has been registered since 2014.
BG_048	14	"""Because of this, we issue prescriptions, we do not immediately proceed to the procedure for reducing stars, because we believe that within 30 days the violations can be corrected and the hotel will meet the category ""five stars"", said Minister Nikolina Angelkova."
BG_048	15	We are launching immediate inspections to detect unregulated provision of services by unlicensed tour operators and travel agents.
BG_048	16	"This is what the Minister of Tourism Nikolina Angelkova told journalists in connection with the reception for citizens and businesses in Sunny Beach, Radio ""Focus""-Burgas reporter."
BG_048	17	"""I am glad that we have launched this initiative and for the first time we are doing such an open reception so that all those who are not able to attend the meetings we organize in Sofia can share their problems and opinions, ideas and opinions,"" Angelkova said."
BG_048	18	She explained that the reception was attended by representatives of the tour operator and travel agent sector, who had expressed their concerns about the unregulated provision of services by unlicensed tour operators and travel agents, so that they could react adequately and not compromise the quality of the product.
BG_048	19	"""So we are launching immediate inspections to establish this in practice and immediate action will be taken."
BG_048	20	"Another thing they commented on is related to the unregulated supply of transport services,"" the tourism minister said, adding that she has spoken with the transport minister and next week they will meet with the SAI and representatives of the municipalities' control bodies so that this problem can be solved."
BG_048	21	"""We will continue with these receptions because I am sure that in this way we will be very useful for the citizens,"" Angelkova said."
BG_048	22	In her words, this year the initiative has been piloted in the two largest resorts.
BG_048	23	"""And of course, if there is a result and people are happy with it, we will continue every year from May onwards so that there is really the most adequate feedback,"" the tourism minister clarified."
BG_055	1	Prime Minister Stefan Yanev:
BG_055	2	After the elections, when the National Assembly is formed, the draft budget for next year will be submitted
BG_055	3	After the elections, when the National Assembly is formed, the draft budget for next year will be tabled.
BG_055	4	"This is what Prime Minister Stefan Yanev said in the framework of the initiative ""Power speaks!"
BG_055	5	"Open"", broadcast on the Council of Ministers' Facebook page, a reporter from the Focus news agency reported."
BG_055	6	In his words, we are in a situation where, in the absence of a parliament and a regular government, the budgetary procedure is not respected in terms of deadlines.
BG_055	7	"""Nevertheless, the caretaker cabinet prepares the budget framework."
BG_055	8	After the elections, when the National Assembly is formed, the draft budget will be tabled.
BG_055	9	Finding the focus and policies on where and how our money should be spent is the job of the newly formed National Assembly team.
BG_055	10	What we will propose will be conservative enough and open enough to possibilities so that the parties, after a debate, can set priorities and decide how the balances should be.
BG_055	11	We have tried to make sure that business is supported and that economic growth is supported and that there are sufficient social measures for citizens.
BG_055	12	"The job of the political parties is to determine which will be the leading priority"", the prime minister said."
BG_055	13	"""We will propose in the draft budget a real budget for the RIA."
BG_055	14	The practice in previous years has been to pledge an amount that has so far been insufficient.
BG_055	15	"Rough calculations show that the necessary funds for road maintenance are in the range of 1.5 - 2 billion per year,"" said Yanev."
BG_055	16	In his words, the newly assumed debt by the state is not invented by the caretaker cabinet, but is provided for as part of the state budget law.
BG_055	17	"""This is the debt that is provided for by law to be part of the revenue side of the state budget for 2021,"" he added."
BG_055	18	"""The migration pressure towards our country has been relatively constant over the past month and a half."
BG_055	19	We paid serious attention to this issue back in August.
BG_055	20	Even then, we took measures so that the country could protect its borders and counter the migrant wave.
BG_055	21	The trend is to keep the numbers of those passing and those being prevented from passing.
BG_055	22	There were also infected among them and treatment was undertaken for them where necessary.
BG_055	23	The caretaker cabinet has systematically addressed the protection of the Bulgarian borders, currently there is a joint operation between the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, with about 350 servicemen on the border with Greece and Turkey.
BG_055	24	Most of them are busy with practical actions to restore the integrity of the barrier and repair the misleading roads.
BG_055	25	"A better organization and security of the border is being created,"" Yanev said."
BG_066	1	Donchev discussed with AICB EU investments for recovery from the pandemic
BG_066	2	In a discussion with the members of the National Council of the Industrial Capital Association of Bulgaria (ICAB) today, the Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria Tomislav Donchev stressed the need for urgent identification of priority areas and mechanisms to invest the funds from the Next Generation EU programme.
BG_066	3	This was announced by the AICB press centre.
BG_066	4	These decisions have to be taken by September and the intervention horizon is shorter compared to the operational programmes, as the investment of the anti-crisis funds will be possible within the next four years.
BG_066	5	For the next programming period our country will have the opportunity to access financial resources amounting to over 29 billion euros.
BG_066	6	In addition to the funds under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, which will total €16.9 billion, the new EU anti-crisis plan - Next Generation EU, with a budget of more than €12.3 billion, is expected to be operational.
BG_066	7	"""Although we have not yet reached a common agreement, I believe that Next Generation EU will work."
BG_066	8	With this plan, the European Union has a chance not only to recover economically from the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to develop.
BG_066	9	We are currently working on updating the approach, reducing the number and better focusing the targets, and redesigning the programmes for the next programming period to make them relevant to the challenges imposed by the Coronercrisis and the Green Pact.
BG_066	10	"I expect by autumn we will be ready with the new proposals"", said Tomislav Donchev."
BG_066	11	The Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria highlighted several important accents, including future measures in the direction of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and the development of energy storage technologies as directly linked to the European Green Pact; innovation, including the development of industrial zones and digitalization of the public and private sectors, education and science.
BG_066	12	He stressed the need to combine grant funding with financial instruments, as well as to significantly broaden the scope of beneficiaries by proposing horizontal measures to support important priorities and activities for business, population and public services.
BG_066	13	"""I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev for his participation in today's meeting of the National Council of AICB and for the fact that we managed with his active assistance to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion and to sign a two-year National Tripartite Agreement between the government, employers and trade unions."
BG_066	14	I am pleased that his priorities for the next programming period overlap to a large extent with the measures and policies set out in the agreement.
BG_066	15	"The measures to exit the crisis are slowing down a bit, but after a number of adopted proposals for changes, the 60/40 measure already has a new working design, and we expect the grants for micro and small enterprises to start being paid soon, as well as the launch of measures to support medium-sized companies,"" said AICB Chairman Vasil Velev."
BG_066	16	AICB SC discussed in detail the challenges our country is facing related to the European Green Pact and possible solutions.
BG_066	17	"The meeting also discussed proposals for measures to address the real problems with the so-called ""poverty reduction""."
BG_066	18	"""dormant shares""."
BG_066	19	The SC of AICB adopted a package of measures to facilitate the exercise of rights by their holders, facilitated certification and inheritance of ownership.
BG_066	20	AICB proposed solutions to the main problems related to the shares acquired by Bulgarian citizens in Bulgarian companies in the course of privatization - such as the lack of awareness of the shares held, the high transaction costs, the complex and expensive administrative procedure for inheritance and disposal and the lack of a real opportunity to sell the shares of many companies.
BG_066	21	The proposals also include creating a free public register, easing the administrative procedure for inheritance and disposal of unlisted shares, creating alternative funds to offer a price after valuation for unlisted shares of listed companies and a stock exchange price for listed ones.
BG_066	22	The measures also include proposals for legislative and technological integration of the Central Depository with the registers of the ESGRON, the NRA and the National Social Insurance Institution in order to identify and contact holders of dematerialised shares and their heirs and to pay dividends directly into bank accounts declared by them.
BG_066	23	The National Council of the Industrial Capital Association in Bulgaria accepted several new organizations and companies as members of the AICB, including: the Bulgarian Association of Establishments, the University Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment in Oncology EAD, Bader Bulgaria KD and others.
BG_070	1	Brussels admits it has not done its job in Bulgaria
BG_070	2	The European Commission will be ashamed next week when it presents its second report on the rule of law in the EU because at least in its part on Bulgaria it will not be able to report any progress in the fight against high-level corruption.
BG_070	3	"The newspaper ""Sega"" has a draft of the report, which is expected to appear on July 20, and it shows the powerlessness of the new control mechanism, which was supposed to replace the previous Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), frozen after 14 years of use."
BG_070	4	"Almost in all the examined areas in the field of justice and media freedom the finding is the same: ""challenges remain"", which translated into ordinary language means that the problems are still the same as they were at the time of the previous (first) report, which appeared on 30 September 2020."
BG_070	5	"Particular attention is paid to the incorrigibility of the prosecutor's office, where ""the challenge of accountability and criminal responsibility of the prosecutor general remains"" (Ivan Geshev)."
BG_070	6	The existing wide opportunities for him to influence the work of prosecutors and even of the judiciary by using his position in the Supreme Judicial Council are pointed out.
BG_070	7	The continued harmful practice of seconding prosecutors and judges for long periods of time instead of organising competitions for regular appointments is highlighted.
BG_070	8	"It has been noted by Brussels that ""sometimes secondments to fill high-level posts last 90-100 months or more""."
BG_070	9	"It is recalled that ""according to European standards, promotion should be based on merit and secondment should be temporary and in exceptional cases""."
BG_070	10	"It has been stated that ""where there is no development on merit, judicial independence may be affected""."
BG_070	11	On high-level corruption, it is said that there are still no final convictions in Bulgaria despite increased investigative activity and resources.
BG_070	12	The Bulgarian authorities have recorded in the period 2014-2020 convictions against 8 traffic police officers accused of corruption.
BG_070	13	In the section on media freedom, which did not exist in the reports of the old monitoring mechanism, no improvement is noted either.
BG_070	14	"""The lack of transparency in media ownership continues to cause concern,"" the draft report says."
BG_070	15	"""There are no rules for fair and transparent procurement of state advertisements (...)"
BG_070	16	Political interference in the media continues (...)
BG_070	17	The working environment and safety of journalists continue to be a concern (...)
BG_070	18	"The state did not provide any direct assistance to the media during the pandemic"", etc."
BG_070	19	Legislators have been criticised for evading public scrutiny by changing important laws through transitional and final provisions of other laws, introducing significant amendments to drafts between two readings in parliament, failing to carry out impact assessments of changed legislation, etc.
BG_070	20	All these sins are associated with the rule of Boyko Borissov, but his name is not mentioned, as the mention of other names is avoided.
BG_070	21	Unlike the CVM reports, there are no longer recommendations and deadlines for addressing the shortcomings.
BG_070	22	In this sense, the new monitoring procedure is less likely to influence in a positive direction the authorities to respect the rule of law.
BG_073	1	Officially:
BG_073	2	DB supports Lozan Panov for President
BG_073	3	"""Democratic Bulgaria"" gives its support for the presidential candidate pair Lozan Panov for president and Maria Kasimova-Moassie for vice-president."
BG_073	4	"The decision was taken by the governing bodies of Green Movement, PP ""Democrats for a strong Bulgaria"" and PP ""Movement ""Yes, Bulgaria"", inform the press center of the union."
BG_073	5	Panov's candidacy was put forward by an initiative committee and for months DB had been making requests that it would propose its own candidate for president.
BG_073	6	"""With particular respect, we underline Mr. Panov's independence."
BG_073	7	It was nominated by an initiative committee not as a convenient formality, but as an integral manifestation of the democratic community and behind it are structures and figures that have proven themselves in real civic efforts.
BG_073	8	"His status as a magistrate is not merely a coincidence of career circumstances, but a cause from which he draws his authority,"" the coalition said."
BG_073	9	"""With his consistent personal fight for the rule of law and judicial independence, Mr. Panov has given concrete biographical evidence that he can be a truly independent president who does not kowtow to the powerful of the day and behind the scenes, does not bend to difficulties and does not kowtow to parties and clans."
BG_073	10	"""Therefore, giving their political support and joining the calls for a strong civic vote and mobilization for the election of Mr. Panov as president, the party structures of ""Democratic Bulgaria"" will approach his and his campaign's independence in law and in spirit with the utmost respect"", the DB further stated."
BG_073	11	"Here is what else the Democratic Bulgaria party says in support of the candidacy of Lozan Panov: ""Democratic Bulgaria"" has as its main mission to defend: the restoration of the parliamentary republic as the main guarantee of freedom and democracy through the consistent resistance against all forms of concentration of power in one hands and limiting the representativeness, accountability and transparency of the government."
BG_073	12	The consolidation of the rule of law and the guarantees of fundamental human freedoms through a deep and comprehensive reform of the judiciary and the rebuilding of the prosecutor's office and key oversight bodies, as well as through consistent efforts to build strong, effective and accountable institutions as the basis for the restoration of Bulgarian statehood.
BG_073	13	The consistent and comprehensive policy to dismantle the corruption model, embodied by the GERB and DPS rule and rooted in the structures of the totalitarian communist regime, whose influence needs to be broken by lustration.
BG_073	14	The conscious aspiration for full integration into the structures of the European Union, including the Eurozone and NATO, and the assertion of Bulgarian sovereignty and security against all forms of foreign influence, especially from neo-authoritarian regimes such as those in the Kremlin and Ankara.
BG_073	15	Implementation of an ambitious and responsible policy for the comprehensive modernization of the country, which guarantees the freedom of entrepreneurship and lays the creation of wealth as its foundation, allowing the realization of the full potential of Bulgaria in the conditions of technological transition and on the basis of the green deal sustainable management of national natural resources.
BG_073	16	Implement a policy of consistent investment in education, culture and health as a basis for the revival of national human capital.
BG_073	17	The values and political identity of the democratic community in Bulgaria.
BG_073	18	We reaffirm the specific policy objectives we set ourselves in the declaration of 21 December 2020.
BG_073	19	In view of the above, DB recognises Mr. Panov as an exponent of these goals and values in the presidential race.
BG_073	20	In him the democratic community of Bulgaria has its natural candidate and bearer of the authentic tradition of the struggle for democracy and the rule of law at a time when we are witnessing yet another replacement.
BG_073	21	We believe that if elected President Mr. Panov can: Defend the agenda of national unity around real democratic and European values and the will for profound change, instead of false clichés of unprincipled connivance, behind which lies an attempt to substitute the truth and escape from responsibility; to confront corruption in a real and consistent way as a profound institutional and moral challenge that requires a complete dismantling of the corruption model and a re-founding of our statehood; to lead the effort to assert our national sovereignty within the EU and NATO not as a contingently expedient staging, but as a comprehensive and long-term policy; to activate the authentic constitutional role of the presidential institution in support of the rule of law, the separation of powers and the parliamentary character of the republic, without drifting towards the formation of new centres of concentration of power that erode the democratic model of state building.
BG_080	1	No medics for Borissov's promised COVID hospital
BG_080	2	"The hospital for the treatment of COVID-19, ""opened"" on Friday by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Plovdiv Mayor Zdravko Dimitrov, is still a mirage."
BG_080	3	Steps are being taken to convert the St. Mina Municipal into such a facility, but there is a long way to go.
BG_080	4	And it is not clear what the end of the process will be because of the lack of doctors.
BG_080	5	"All this contrasts sharply with the loud promises on Friday - Borissov insistently asked several times ""Will there be a COVID-hospital today?"""
BG_080	6	", and when pressed, the mayor replied positively, ""Yes, today!"""
BG_080	7	.
BG_080	8	"All this happened during the strange dialogue on the steps in front of the hospital ""Pulmed"", where Dimitrov is being treated for a coronavirus, and Borissov arranged a live Facebook meeting."
BG_080	9	"""St. Mina"", which has been treating patients with COVID-19, is suffocating for lack of money, medics and equipment."
BG_080	10	The idea is to open 150 beds there, as currently 90 are officially announced, but in practice the resources are enough for about 60.
BG_080	11	Currently, the hospital has only 6 doctors and 10 nurses for COVID-19 patients.
BG_080	12	A tranche of £277,000 is expected from the council on Wednesday, which will be used to set up a PCR lab and make renovations.
BG_080	13	However, about BGN 1 million more are needed.
BG_080	14	That things were in their infancy was made clear by a call from the council for volunteer doctors.
BG_080	15	Negotiations are also underway with teams from other establishments.
BG_080	16	In addition, the head of the Health Directorate Kalin Kalinov said, quoted by the municipal press centre, that the intention is to keep the cardiology, surgery and children's wards.
BG_080	17	"This in turn suggests that the term ""COVID-hospital"" would be mostly packaging."
BG_080	18	And many facilities are currently treating coronavirus, with their other wards also operating.
BG_080	19	It is also known that even after its restructuring, St. Mina will not serve the severe cases.
BG_080	20	How all this correlates with Health Minister Kostadin Angelov's order of yesterday that at least one hospital be set up in each district town entirely for COVID-19 patients (plus at least one for non-COVID-19 patients) is still unknown.
BG_080	21	FOR PAYMENT.
BG_080	22	Later on Wednesday, the Plovdiv City Council did indeed vote to help St. Mina.
BG_080	23	It turned out to be worth 83 000 BGN.
BG_080	24	But instead of a PCR lab, the money will likely go to staff salaries.
BG_080	25	The spending will be at the discretion of the director of the hospital prof.
BG_080	26	Peter Petrov.
BG_080	27	And he confirmed to councillors the critical situation with doctors.
BG_080	28	He advised that the beds are currently being staffed with a minimal number of people and a lot of extra hours and as of Monday the beds should be 137.
BG_080	29	"""I do my best to involve colleagues and nurses."
BG_080	30	We need at least 12 doctors and 24 nurses.
BG_080	31	"I appeal for help for cadres,"" cried Petrov."
BG_080	32	He said he would like to open a children's coronavirus sector as well, but again he needs medics.
BG_080	33	Because of all this, the amount allocated by the council is likely to go towards salaries.
BG_080	34	The hope is that the government will also give money.
BG_080	35	INTERVENTIONS.
BG_080	36	"The problems did not prevent Zdravko Dimitrov to announce a few days ago that he is preparing to open even a second COVID-hospital - by restoring the dysfunctional lung dispensary ""Dimitry Kudoglu""."
BG_080	37	But on this topic there were sparks between him and his predecessor Ivan Totev, who is a regional leader of GERB.
BG_080	38	"Dimitrov wrote on social networks that the hospital ""Dimitar Kudoglu"" has not been functioning since 2014 because of a decision of the former leadership of the municipality."
BG_080	39	"""The hospital was not closed, but relocated."
BG_080	40	"All the equipment was moved to St. George's University Hospital, all the doctors went there,"" Totev told Radio Plovdiv."
BG_080	41	"And he was slightly ironic towards Dimitrov: ""He is in hospital after all."
BG_080	42	You can tell everything when you are in such a state.
BG_080	43	"He wants to help."""
BG_080	44	Totev's words are yet another proof of the tension in GERB - Plovdiv, which is intensifying as the parliamentary elections approach.
BG_080	45	The issues around healthcare are just a current occasion for them to erupt.
BG_080	46	Even earlier Totev and he burned Dimitrov several times.
BG_090	1	Prof.
BG_090	2	Rumen Gechev: A new cabinet based on the Bulgarian interest The Bulgarian Socialist Party claims a gentlemanly attitude towards it from the presidency and nothing more.
BG_090	3	We do not interfere in the work of the president and our claim is that he should also not interfere in our internal party affairs.
BG_090	4	"This was stated by the MP from ""BSP for Bulgaria"" prof."
BG_090	5	Rumen Gechev told Nova TV.
BG_090	6	Trimorie is a problem.
BG_090	7	Here, we have a discrepancy regarding Dimitar Stoyanov from the presidency, who took out some notes about the delivery of weapons.
BG_090	8	BSP is against arms exports - neither to Russia nor to Ukraine.
BG_090	9	Kornelia Ninova as minister is responsible for arms exports, but she is the last one to sign.
BG_090	10	The heads of the SANS, who are appointed by the presidency, also sign there.
BG_090	11	It is frivolous, when you have representatives in the committee, to claim that something is wrong.
BG_090	12	An example of interference are the words of Vice President Iliana Iotova.
BG_090	13	She said in the first days of the new government that it would not get even 100 days, although this is an international practice.
BG_090	14	And, secondly, she said that the social policy of the cabinet is a failure and this is not true.
BG_090	15	Thanks to the BSP, the budget will have more than 23 billion leva for social benefits.
BG_090	16	And I do not like Yotova to say that the social policy of the government is a failure.
BG_090	17	In Bulgaria there are processes that are related to the geopolitical conflicts and shifts in the world.
BG_090	18	The conflicts are not personal, as some try to portray them.
BG_090	19	This is a very serious political battle.
BG_090	20	Some people are not reconciled with the principled position of the BSP, who want to maintain a good balance.
BG_090	21	It is very important to adopt the budget so that the funds go to the working Bulgarian families and Bulgarian pensioners.
BG_090	22	I think common sense prevails.
BG_090	23	In my opinion, there is no party that in the pre-election situation would fail the budget and deprive over 2 million pensioners and hundreds of thousands of Bulgarian families of tax preferences and additional funds for healthcare.
BG_090	24	Once the decision on pensions has been made, the funds will reach the elderly, even if this is a build-up in August.
BG_090	25	Relative to GDP, Bulgaria has one of the lowest external debts.
BG_090	26	GERB's accusations of accumulating colossal debts are unfounded.
BG_090	27	When they took power in 2009, we had a debt of 13.5%, so under them our debt was doubled.
BG_090	28	With We Keep the Change we have foreign policy differences, some of which have a strong economic impact.
BG_090	29	What we would insist on in negotiations is to be careful with foreign policy assessments.
BG_090	30	What European countries are doing is to continue to keep Gazprom as a competitive supplier.
BG_090	31	Let there be competition so that Bulgarian businesses get good prices.
BG_090	32	The BSP has a decision of its National Council and we insist on negotiations with Gazprom.
BG_090	33	In these conditions, Bulgaria needs a government to be formed, but this cannot be at any cost and still there must be certain limits.
BG_090	34	These principles should be based on the Bulgarian interest.
BG_090	35	ITNs are sending signals that they are ready to have conversations and there is potential to be looked for.
BG_092	1	President Rumen Radev:
BG_092	2	Bulgaria and the Federal State of Hamburg to expand their partnership in the field of alternative energy and high technology
BG_092	3	Hamburg.
BG_092	4	The traditions of the successful economic partnership between Bulgaria and the Federal State of Hamburg will be extended to new areas such as alternative energy sources and high technologies.
BG_092	5	This is what President Rumen Radev said after his meeting with the Prime Minister of Hamburg and Mayor of the city Peter Chencer.
BG_092	6	The Head of State is visiting the Federal Republic of Germany at the invitation of his counterpart President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, with whom the Bulgarian President held a meeting in Berlin.
BG_092	7	We can overcome today's challenges successfully only if together we develop technologies, seek new solutions and create production, the Head of State emphasized.
BG_092	8	In his words, in the long term Bulgaria and Germany should exchange experience and use new technologies and solutions to achieve independence in the energy sector.
BG_092	9	President Rumen Radev highlighted Hamburg's experience in developing technologies in the field of green hydrogen and the opportunities for cooperation with Bulgaria in this direction.
BG_092	10	"""Germany, with its leading industry, will need a lot of hydrogen in the future and Bulgaria can produce green hydrogen and be a reliable supplier,"" the Head of State said and expressed confidence that the two countries will have fruitful cooperation in this area."
BG_092	11	During his visit to Hamburg, President Rumen Radev also held a meeting with the leadership and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce.
BG_092	12	The Bulgarian President stressed that joint efforts are needed to tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
BG_092	13	Rumen Radev highlighted the advantages of Bulgaria as a country with good conditions for investors - highly qualified personnel, macroeconomic stability and strategic location.
BG_092	14	During the meeting at the Chamber of Commerce the representatives of the Bulgarian business, included in the delegation led by the Head of State, had the opportunity to discuss with their German counterparts opportunities for cooperation.
BG_092	15	The implementation of a 15 billion euro project for the production of green hydrogen in the Maritsa East complex was presented by Bulgarian business, part of the delegation led by the Head of State in Germany.
BG_092	16	The investment intentions envisage the co-financing by the business of the creation of solar capacity for the production of green hydrogen, part of which will be exported and another part will be used to balance the country's energy grid.
BG_092	17	The plans of the business are to complete the transformation of Maritsa East in the next 10 years, with 7,500 jobs expected to be created and another 18,000 in the supporting industries.
BG_092	18	"The Bulgarian business was represented by the leaders of the nationally representative employers' organizations, the management of the ""Thrace Economic Zone"", the largest in the Balkans, as well as representatives of companies with already established partnerships in Germany in the field of alternative energy sources."
BG_092	19	The Head of State emphasized that Bulgaria already has companies that have practical experience in replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen.
BG_092	20	Earlier, the Head of State also visited one of the largest metallurgical companies in Germany, Aurubis, which is active in Bulgaria with its copper mining plant.
BG_092	21	Rumen Radev got acquainted with the company's activities and highlighted the need for even higher ambitions to increase exports of products with higher added value.
BG_092	22	The common position was that the company's corporate social responsibility is a strong positive example for the business.

BG_093	1	The Ukrainian Minister of Youth and Sports thanked Radostin Vassilev for the support Bulgaria gives to Ukrainian athletes
BG_093	2	Vassilev participates in the EU Council for Education, Youth, Culture and Sport.
BG_093	3	Minister of Youth and Sport Radostin Vassilev is among the participants in the first meeting of the European Union Council for Education, Youth, Culture and Sport, which is taking place in Luxembourg, the Ministry of Youth and Sport announced.
BG_093	4	Ministers for sport hold an orientation debate on promoting EU values through sport and its organisation.
BG_093	5	Before the start of the debate, Minister of Youth and Sports of Ukraine Vadym Gutzeit made a short video address.
BG_093	6	He expressed his gratitude to his Bulgarian colleague Radostin Vassilev.
BG_093	7	Gutzeit expressed his appreciation for the help Ukrainian athletes receive when training in Bulgaria.
BG_093	8	In his speech, Minister Vassilev noted that the contemporary international order and the current challenges, including the war in Ukraine, are confronting humanity with new challenges.
BG_093	9	"""These challenges also serve as a catalyst in the process of realising the importance and central role, including in sport, of our shared values within the EU of peace, democracy, solidarity, integrity and the protection of human rights."
BG_093	10	They also lead us in our actions in support of citizens and the sports sector affected by the war in Ukraine.
BG_093	11	In an expression of solidarity, public authorities and sports organisations in Bulgaria are making joint efforts to accommodate Ukrainian athletes and provide sports facilities for training.
BG_093	12	Bulgaria needs help in this function and I welcome Poland's request for the creation of such a mechanism.
BG_093	13	"I am firmly convinced that Bulgaria, Romania, Finland, Poland and Lithuania cannot tackle this challenge alone"", the Minister of Youth and Sport said."
BG_093	14	Vassilev said that it is necessary to continue the line of promoting exchanges between grassroots sports organisations from EU and third countries.
BG_093	15	He gave the example not only of Ukraine, but also of the Western Balkan countries.
BG_093	16	Minister Vassilev pointed to the Erasmus+ programme as an extremely useful tool in this respect.
BG_093	17	"""Our common values are not only what unites and characterises us in our response to events outside the EU."
BG_093	18	They are also at the heart of the actions we take to ensure that sport is always associated with positive social activity, accessible, inclusive and in demand, rather than negative practices such as match fixing, doping, violence and other negative sporting behaviours.
BG_093	19	"In the light of the emergence of new actors, practices and expectations, we should ensure that the economic and commercialization will not take precedence over the set of values that are an integral part of the European sports model,"" said Radostin Vassilev He announced that together with the Minister of Education and Science Academician Nikolay Denkov and the Minister of Culture Atanas Atanasov, they are developing a National Program that correlatively links the educational, social, cultural and health functions of sport to overcome the consequences of the European sport model."
BG_093	20	In conclusion, Minister Radostin Vassilev said that sport has a role to play in promoting awareness of climate change, achieving greater policy coherence and promoting and practicing more sustainable sport.
BG_093	21	"""All of this at a time when the EU is facing challenges in terms of its energy security and is looking for alternatives, it is becoming abundantly clear that green transition policies are not cutting-edge and innovative options for the future, but an actual solution."
BG_093	22	"A multi-sectoral approach is needed in which athletes also have a role to play,"" Vassilev said."
BG_093	23	EU sports ministers endorsed conclusions on sport and physical activity as promising levers to transform behaviour in favour of sustainable development.
BG_093	24	"Tomorrow (05.04) Vassilev will take part in the Council of Youth Ministers, which will hold an orientation debate on ""Mobility of European young volunteers: building links between national and transnational experiences to nurture European citizenship""."
BG_098	1	DB denied that Petkov had made the decision on the Russian diplomats alone
BG_098	2	Former Prime Minister Kiril Petkov did not take the decision to expel the 70 employees of the Russian embassy alone.
BG_098	3	The issue was discussed on May 18, at a coalition council.
BG_098	4	This was announced in Parliament by the co-chairman of the DB Hristo Ivanov.
BG_098	5	He said that the right supports the measure, for which it has long insisted.
BG_098	6	"The right-wing politician made his comments in response to a stormy and downright offensive statement on the occasion by the leader of ""Revival"" Kostadin Kostadinov."
BG_098	7	"From the parliamentary rostrum he declared Kiril Petkov a ""national traitor"" who should be ""placed under ban""."
BG_098	8	In his words, the only reason why the ex-premier expelled the Russians was to please the US and thus get the opportunity to rule again.
BG_098	9	"Interestingly, Kostadinov called Petkov a ""random bystander"" in the government - a phrase that first came from the MRF."
BG_098	10	"""If anyone should be placed under ban, it is the representatives of Revival"", reacted unusually sharply Hristo Ivanov to the declaration."
BG_098	11	"""This speech must have been written by Ms Zakharova (the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry - ed.)"", ironically commented Nastimir Ananiev of the PP on the nationalist leader's statement."
BG_098	12	Interim Parliament Speaker Miroslav Ivanov made a remark to all those who spoke.
BG_098	13	However, he again did not dare to impose penalties, although Kostadinov clearly violated the rules of the National Assembly by insulting other state institutions.
BG_098	14	ITN did not support the outgoing Prime Minister Kiril Petkov for Bulgaria's decision to recall 70 Russian diplomats.
BG_098	15	"""The truth is that this is his personal decision and it came to him while he was travelling on the train to Ukraine, somewhere there at the stations"", ITN's chairman Toshko Yordanov told Nova TV."
BG_098	16	In his words, even then Foreign Minister Teodora Genchovska, who is from the ITN quota in the quadripartite coalition, explained to the prime minister that this was a measure that was not done in this way.
BG_098	17	"""There are certain rules."
BG_098	18	"This is not to play the neighborhood kids and get angry,"" Yordanov said."
BG_098	19	"According to him, the action of recalling diplomats was like a ""dance"" because the other side was taking reciprocal measures."
BG_098	20	"""Now, if they decide to play reciprocally, we should expel all of them and be left without diplomatic representation there."
BG_098	21	"Such a thing has never been done in war"", Yordanov is adamant."
BG_098	22	"He admitted that ""there was some report from SANS"" about possible spies in the Russian diplomatic mission in Bulgaria, but he doubted ""whether the service was not also following the prime minister's orders""."
BG_098	23	"Finally, Toshko Yordanov remarked, ""I avoid saying whether he is against it or not, because he is not inside the system, but he is not so abrupt and I have some doubts whether they are all spies, because the number came into his head 4 months ago."""
BG_098	24	Maya Manolova, the leader of Stand Up Bulgaria, also expressed criticism regarding the recall of Russian diplomats.
BG_098	25	"""In its attempt to win the favour of the Western partners, the government of Petkov and Ninova crossed all borders, taking more extreme positions than most European countries."
BG_098	26	For the first and last time in our history Bulgaria is expelling 70 Russian diplomats at once and without publicly announced reasons!
BG_098	27	And this - after we self-syndicatedly left ourselves without long-term gas supplies and the prime minister is waging war with the Bulgarian president in front of the world media, presenting himself as the only and indispensable Western ally.
BG_098	28	Inexperience and servility cannot be an excuse for political stupidity in foreign policy, because it has lasting consequences, threatens historical ties that will be difficult to rebuild over the years, and harms the country's interests.
BG_098	29	"And if Petkov and Ninova do not see a problem with this shame, the Bulgarian people will not accept it!"""
BG_098	30	, the former ombudsman wrote on Facebook.
BG_098	31	"""Something like this has not happened since Bulgaria had modern diplomacy."
BG_098	32	"We are talking here more about cultural attachés, press attachés, commercial attachés, representatives of the Russian services disguised under other diplomatic positions, which are many and currently quite active"", former foreign minister Milen Keremedchiev told bTV."
BG_098	33	According to him, the important thing is to find out whether these 70 expelled employees will be replaced by others or their positions will be abolished.
BG_098	34	In his words, the note handed to Mitrofanova hints at moving towards reciprocity.
BG_098	35	"""The Russian Federation has the largest number of diplomats in our country."
BG_098	36	It varies up to about 150 people.
BG_098	37	"This is more than 10 times more than our diplomats in Russia, we have 10-15 people there,"" Keremedchiev said."
BG_102	1	Cornelia Ninova:
BG_102	2	Thanks to the BSP every family will save 300 BGN per child for textbooks
BG_102	3	"""In this parliament BSP managed to implement its social policy, especially aimed at children, young people and young families."
BG_102	4	The free textbooks will help 280,000 children.
BG_102	5	"Each family will save 300 BGN per child for books."""
BG_102	6	"This is what the leader of the BSP Kornelia Ninova said in the ""Interview in Nova News""."
BG_102	7	She pointed out another positive - the increased minimum wage, adopted mostly under pressure from the BSP.
BG_102	8	"""Something the caretaker cabinet did not want"", Ninova pointed out."
BG_102	9	"""You probably don't remember, but there was a bill to close nurseries."
BG_102	10	We put up an incredible resistance across the country and saved the nurseries.
BG_102	11	"One more good thing - municipal hospitals, libraries, community centers, nursing homes - thanks to the BSP received support for the price of electricity and more than 200 BGN is covered by the state"", summed up Ninova about the work of the parliamentary group of ""BSP for Bulgaria"" in the 48th National Assembly."
BG_102	12	In her words, although the left has learnt its lessons from the governing coalition, she is satisfied that the BSP ministers have fulfilled their commitments to the people.
BG_102	13	"""This was the most powerful social policy in recent years - an increase in pensions, maternity, free kindergartens and nurseries, an increase in the minimum wage, food vouchers."
BG_102	14	"We defended our face"", recalled Kornelia Ninova."
BG_102	15	"""Our position is that giving weapons prolongs the war."
BG_102	16	The issue must be resolved diplomatically.
BG_102	17	Listen to what voices there have been in recent weeks from the big ones in Europe.
BG_102	18	"Both President Macron and Chancellor Scholz said, ""Despite the criticism, we will not stop the dialogue and the path towards Russia and we will have a conversation with Putin."""
BG_102	19	"This is the way - talks, diplomacy and restoration of peace"", the BSP leader said about the war in Ukraine."
BG_102	20	She called on all those who say that Bulgaria exported weapons to Ukraine to bring out a document.
BG_102	21	"""What has been said lately - production has jumped so much that we have made 6 billion worth of exports."
BG_102	22	Here is a transcript from the National Assembly where I asked the current Minister of Economy, who is not a fan of mine because I fired him for corruption.
BG_102	23	He answers from the rostrum of the parliament that the government has exported arms for 2 billion.
BG_102	24	"Where are two, where are six?"""
BG_102	25	, said Ninova.
BG_102	26	She also showed a report from the National Assembly, where she said everything was written - from where, to where, what quantity, for what money it was exported.
BG_102	27	"""Bulgaria before, now and after us will export weapons to 60 countries."
BG_102	28	These countries buy it and give us a document that they take it for themselves, i.e. they are the end user.
BG_102	29	This is under Bulgarian and international law.
BG_102	30	Once they become owners, they can donate it, resell it.
BG_102	31	"We do not have the right, nor is it required by international law, for them to provide us with information,"" Kornelia Ninova explained and added that when exporting arms, the Minister of Economy does not sign anything himself."
BG_102	32	It is preceded by the SANS, Military Intelligence, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
BG_102	33	"""How can you imagine Bulgaria with the Arsenal ammunition to have saved Ukraine, where billions of modern weapons were poured?"
BG_102	34	This is absolutely frivolous.
BG_102	35	"This is a race to see who is best in front of external forces"", she said."
BG_102	36	"""Before Sergei Stanishev reproaches the BSP leadership, he should answer a few questions."
BG_102	37	Why did he introduce the most right-wing measure - a flat tax, which we still bear the brunt of?
BG_102	38	With the decision of which collective body did you embrace and make a coalition with Lyutvi Mestan on Orlov Bridge?
BG_102	39	"And lastly, to explain why the biggest corruption scandal in Europe - ""Qatargate"" - broke out in the PES during his time."
BG_102	40	"When he answers these questions, let him go,"" Ninova said of the former party chairman's comments."
BG_102	41	Kornelia Ninova pointed out that there will be an election of the BSP chairman in a year and a half.
BG_102	42	"""We are the most democratic party in Bulgaria - the only one that elects its president by a vote of all members."
BG_102	43	Congress cannot elect a president.
BG_102	44	So after a year and a half, all contenders for the post are welcome.
BG_102	45	"To appear before the party members and whatever they decide,"" she concluded."
BG_105	1	After the scandal, the cumbersome procedure for children's medicines in the NHIF will be eased
BG_105	2	Decho Dechev, manager of the NHIF.
BG_105	3	The cumbersome procedure for financing children's medicines after the transfer of the Children's Treatment Fund to the NHIF is in the process of being eased.
BG_105	4	Although it is slow and time-consuming, it in no way affects the healing process and children receive adequate and timely treatment with medications not approved in our country.
BG_105	5	"This was assured on Thursday at a hearing in the parliamentary health committee by the governor of the NHIF, the health minister and doctors from the hospital ""Tsaritsa Ioanna""-ISUL."
BG_105	6	They were answering questions from MPs over the scandal of the delayed payment of medicines for the treatment of the six-year-old child with Down's Syndrome who was treated for leukaemia and subsequently died.
BG_105	7	The cumbersome administrative procedure and lengthy correspondence between the NHIF and the hospital regarding the payment of the medicines already administered has called into question whether an adequate procedure has been established for the NHIF as the successor of the Children's Fund to pay the hospitals.
BG_105	8	On Thursday, the hospital, the ministry and the NHIF admitted that the procedure is indeed complicated and its simplification is being sought, but it is not yet a fact.
BG_105	9	It was not clear why the relaxed procedure was not devised and implemented before the transfer of the children's fund to the NHIF, but only now almost 3 months later when it is already giving problems.
BG_105	10	At the moment, the hospitals are working on an option to give requests for the necessary medicines for a longer period based on an analysis of the patients, explained Health Minister Kiril Ananiev.
BG_105	11	His deputy, Zheni Nacheva, added that this way the medicines would be requested and paid for a longer period of time, not for each individual case.
BG_105	12	However, an organization has been created so that the hospital can start the treatment of the child as soon as the parents submit the documents to the NHIF and no special permission is needed, explained the director of the pediatric oncohematology at ISUL prof.
BG_105	13	Dobrin Konstantinov.
BG_105	14	About the case of six-year-old Maria, he pointed out that not a single stage of her treatment was missed and medicines were not missing at any point, and there was only a delay in the administrative procedures, which led the hospital to submit an invoice to the family and use money from the donation account for treatment in Germany.
BG_105	15	The manager of the NHIF, Decho Dechev, also commented that there is no connection between the issuance of an order by him for the payment of the medicines and the treatment of the child and that one does not interfere with the other.
BG_105	16	However, he said he would not sign documents in the presence of incomplete documentation and adhered to the regulations.
BG_105	17	The BSP deputy prof. Georgi Mihaylov, who is also an oncohematologist, called for his colleagues not to be put in a similar situation to present invoices to the ruined parents of sick children and the procedure to be simplified and eased as much as possible.
BG_105	18	He pointed out that the fact that the correspondence between the NHIF and the hospital about Maria's case lasted from April 25 to June 19 was indicative that the procedure was cumbersome and problematic.
BG_105	19	Earlier, the hospital rejected the accusations of the NHIF a day ago that the hospital was to blame for the delay in the procedure because it had not provided all the requested documents.
BG_105	20	From the words of Minister Ananiev, it was learned that the reason for the delay in payment was that the cashier's office had asked the hospital for a document on the price of the medicine administered to Maria, and right at that moment (after the termination of her treatment because of her deteriorated condition) the product was missing in the hospital pharmacy and the hospital could not provide a price, but once it was obtained it was presented.
BG_105	21	On this occasion Mihailov commented that it is unacceptable that hospitals should be left alone to deal with the problem of the increasingly disappearing from the Bulgarian market because of their low prices life-saving drugs used in the daily practice of hospitals.
BG_105	22	Hospitals are powerless in front of distributors, he commented and urged the Ministry of Health or the National Health Insurance Fund to deal with their supply.
BG_109	1	Deputy Minister Atanaska Nikolova presented the environmental aspects of the...
BG_109	2	The Ministry of Environment and Water (MoEW) held a discussion with stakeholders on the draft National Recovery and Sustainability Plan with a focus on the Green Bulgaria section.
BG_109	3	This was announced by the press centre of the Ministry.
BG_109	4	"During a virtual meeting, Deputy Minister of Environment and Water Atanaska Nikolova introduced the participants to the ""green"" elements of the plan, which have found a place in it."
BG_109	5	Among the participants were representatives of business, employers, trade unions and NGOs, academia and experts from the Ministry of Environment and Water.
BG_109	6	"""Europe has always been a leader in the fight for a cleaner planet and in efforts to reduce the human impact on climate change."
BG_109	7	"Green development has also been highlighted as a top priority in the process of recovery from the crisis caused by COVID-19,"" said Deputy Prime Minister."
BG_109	8	-Minister Nikolova.
BG_109	9	She stressed that together with the European partners Bulgaria is working hard on measures to support the recovery and sustainability of the EU economies.
BG_109	10	According to the methodology for the allocation of funds under the Recovery and Sustainability Facility, Bulgaria will have access to 6.217 billion euro of grant and 4.55 billion euro of loan resources.
BG_109	11	For this purpose, a draft Recovery and Sustainability Plan for the Republic of Bulgaria has been developed, which includes four pillars with the following percentage distribution of the total resources: Innovative Bulgaria - with 20%, Green Bulgaria - with 37%, Connected Bulgaria - 22%, Fair Bulgaria - 21%.
BG_109	12	In the Innovative Bulgaria pillar, and in particular in the Smart Industry component, emphasis is placed on the transition to a circular and resource-efficient economy.
BG_109	13	The main objective is to support large enterprises in the transition to a circular economy by introducing recycling technologies, environmental standardisation and promoting eco-innovation and industrial symbiosis between enterprises.
BG_109	14	"In the ""Green Bulgaria"" pillar projects will be implemented for a total amount of BGN 4.499 billion."
BG_109	15	As can be seen from the distribution of funds between the different pillars, it is here that most of the resources are concentrated - nearly 37% of the total amount of the recovery instrument.
BG_109	16	"""This is yet another proof of the priority and importance of the policies for the implementation of the green transition"", underlined the Deputy Prime Minister."
BG_109	17	-the Minister.
BG_109	18	The Low Carbon Economy focuses on reducing the energy intensity of the economy and supporting the green transition by taking measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.
BG_109	19	In the Biodiversity strand, a project is proposed to integrate the ecosystem approach and the application of nature-based solutions in the conservation of protected areas of the NATURA 2000 network.
BG_109	20	"In the ""Connected Bulgaria"" pillar, a total resource of just over BGN 2.675 billion is foreseen, with two projects in the field of water management included in the ""Local Development"" strand."
BG_109	21	One is related to the construction/reconstruction/retrofitting of water supply and sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants for agglomerations between 2,000 and 10,000 inhabitants equivalent, the other to digitalization for integrated management, control and efficient use of water.
BG_109	22	In addition to today's online meeting, the MoEW also held thematic meetings to present water management projects, including an online meeting of the High Water Advisory Council on 16 November.
BG_109	23	The draft National Plan has been sent to the members of the Council's Working Group 20 on the Environment and the National Expert Council on Climate Change for suggestions.

BG_120	1	Vaccinated with two different vaccines cannot receive a certificate
BG_120	2	Those vaccinated against coronavirus with two different vaccines cannot receive a certificate.
BG_120	3	The reason is that the system did not foresee this possibility.
BG_120	4	This problem is currently being fixed by software engineers.
BG_120	5	This became clear from a BNT report made on a signal of doctors from Varna.
BG_120	6	On April 19, former Health Minister Kostadin Angelov said that anyone who has received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine has the right to have a second dose of Pfizer/BioNTek.
BG_120	7	On Friday, patients with this desire are being immunized at St. Catherine's Hospital in Varna.
BG_120	8	However, it turns out that they cannot get a certificate of completed vaccination.
BG_120	9	"""The system is made in such a way that when we enter the patient's ID number, his first dose of vaccination with Astra-Zeneca comes out and does not allow the system to change the type of vaccine, respectively to Pfizer or other RNA and to be reflected in the second needle,"" said Dr. Galina Pavlova, manager of St. Catherine's Health Centre 5 in Varna."
BG_120	10	She seeks the assistance of the Regional Health Inspectorate in the city.
BG_120	11	They explain to her to immunize the patients and collect their data, and when the problem is fixed to enter the data into the platform and then call the people to get their certificate.
BG_120	12	Dr Pavlova fears that this could take a long time and create more work for staff who are already overwhelmed with paperwork.
BG_120	13	The most serious risk, however, is for the patients themselves, because if their health deteriorates, they cannot prove that they were vaccinated with a second dose, the doctor said.
BG_120	14	And during these weekends there are green corridors in major hospitals for all who wish to be vaccinated.
BG_120	15	"As of Monday, the new caretaker health minister's order is pending and the vaccination staff will continue, the director of the country's largest emergency hospital ""Pirogov"" Assen Baltov told bTV."
BG_120	16	His opinion is that these corridors should remain.
BG_120	17	He said he did not know if the corridors would be closed, but there was an idea to give GPs more opportunity to vaccinate.
BG_120	18	It's believed they could more quickly accumulate more vaccination cases from their patient lists, Baltow said.
BG_120	19	According to him, since the beginning of the green corridors, 46 thousand people have been vaccinated against Covid-19, of whom 16 thousand have been given a second dose.
BG_120	20	Regarding patients with a first dose of AstraZeneca and a second dose of Pfizer/BioNTek, Baltov commented that they are very few.
BG_120	21	He indicated that he is aware of the problem and the software engineers are currently fixing the program.
BG_120	22	Vaccination certificates for these cases will probably be issued next week, Assen Baltov said.
BG_120	23	"""I very much hope that vaccinations will do their best to calm the third wave for good."
BG_120	24	My prediction is that by the end of June we will have collective immunity.
BG_120	25	"If we continue in this form - by the end of July we will have a lot of people sick and vaccinated with more than one dose"" , said Baltov."

BG_128	4	During the day Ilin Dimitrov held a number of meetings with representatives of local businesses.
BG_128	5	At the Bulgarian Embassy in Berlin the official guests had a meeting with Mrs. Goertz-Meisner, President of the German Spa Association.
BG_128	6	In view of the close cooperation between Germany and Bulgaria, in the face of the Bulgarian Union of Balneology and Spa, and the importance of this segment for both countries, the topic was among the important highlights of the visit.
BG_128	7	The talks focused on deepening work between health systems, particularly in the light of prevention and rehabilitation following the COVID-19 pandemic.
BG_128	8	Over 350 spas and health resorts in Germany are available for special medical treatments.
BG_128	9	They are known for their competence, tradition and innovation in applying therapies in an attractive and health-friendly environment in all areas of the region.
BG_128	10	Health services are very popular.
BG_128	11	Classic support and rehabilitation measures in treatment include wellness-oriented activities.
BG_128	12	Topics such as entertainment, exercise and stress management are also present.
BG_128	13	And for a spa resort to be successful, away from the big cities you can see bike paths and hiking trails among the beautiful nature and fresh air.
BG_128	14	In the evening, a meeting will take place with representatives of the German Hotel and Restaurant Association Brandenburg (DEHOGA Brandenburg) and other industry associations.
BG_128	15	DEHOGA Brandenburg's main concern is to promote entrepreneurial success through its activities, to help secure jobs, and to enhance the quality of life, tourism attractiveness and hospitality in the state of Brandenburg.
BG_128	16	With around 1,200 members, the association represents the entire spectrum of the hospitality industry - from cafes and pubs to restaurants, guesthouses, hotels, catering, gourmet restaurants and luxury hotels.
BG_128	17	In this way, the association is creating a strong industry which, with around 6,000 companies, around €1 billion in sales, 28,000 employees and around 3,500 apprentices, forms the basis of Brandenburg's economy.
BG_128	18	In Berlin, the Chairman of the Tourism Committee Dr. Ilin Dimitrov met with Jana Schimke, MP and Chairman of the Tourism Committee in the Bundestag, to discuss issues related to bilateral cooperation and the deepening of ties in the field of tourism between Bulgaria and Germany.
BG_128	19	Ilin Dimitrov is on a working visit together with the Minister of Tourism Hristo Prodanov and Snezhana Apostolova - Member of Parliament and Deputy Chairman of the Tourism Committee.
BG_128	20	Here is what the chairman of the Tourism Committee in the Bulgarian Parliament said after the meeting: 'Mrs Schimke and I share similar views on the strong link between education and tourism.
BG_128	21	I invited her to visit us in the autumn.
BG_128	22	"The good news is that it will come with representatives of the German health insurance companies and this is another step in the direction of extending the season and activating health tourism."" According to Schimke, after two years of pandemic, declining sales and loss of employees in the hospitality industry, gastronomy and many other companies in the tourism industry, the task of heading a parliamentary committee on tourism carries a special responsibility and the aim is to support the industry through good parliamentary initiatives."
BG_128	23	The meeting placed special emphasis on the development of sustainable tourism and discussed the initiatives the federal government is taking in this direction.
BG_128	24	Ongoing challenges and the recovery of the sector after the more than two-year-long COVID-19 pandemic were also among the main highlights of the talks.
BG_128	25	Tourism is an important economic sector for Germany, providing a living for around three million people.
BG_128	26	Nearly four per cent of the federal state's GDP can be attributed to hotel accommodation, restaurant visits or tour companies that epitomise hospitality in Germany.
BG_128	27	The Tourism Committee of the German Bundestag is one of the 25 parliamentary standing committees first established in 1998.
BG_128	28	It is made up of 19 members from all factions and deals with tourism-related issues such as improving the general conditions for tourism, the effects of the shortage of skilled workers on the industry and the particular characteristics of rural areas.
BG_128	29	The committee also deals with issues related to tourism infrastructure, labour law and many others.
BG_128	30	During their visit to Germany tomorrow the Bulgarian representatives will also meet Claudia Mueller, Commissioner for Tourism of the Federal Government and Member of the German Parliament.
BG_140	1	Katsarov exempts hospitals from requirements for number of doctors
BG_140	2	The lack of a parliament ties the hands of the caretaker government in many ways, but the caretaker health minister Stoycho Katsarov plans to use the situation to push through fundamental changes in the work of hospitals in the country.
BG_140	3	With changes in 36 regulations, Katsarov proposes to reduce the requirements for the activity of medical institutions related to the number of doctors needed for the implementation of clinical pathways.
BG_140	4	The 26-page document has been published for public discussion and is likely to generate disputes whether it is right for a caretaker government to push through such reformist solutions in its limited mandate.
BG_140	5	"""Many of these requirements were introduced over the years as a result of lobby pressure aimed at administratively restricting the supply of one or another type of medical activities, which led to limiting patients' choices of where to be treated and to hospitals' excessive costs for covering unjustified administrative requirements,"" the minister argued."
BG_140	6	There has been dissatisfaction with the standards in the system for years, but similar arguments can be made against the Minister's initiative with the opposite sign - the relaxation of requirements can be used in bad faith.
BG_140	7	Imbalances in payment for clinical pathways, for example, led to a boom in invasive cardiology clinics years ago, without it being clear to what extent they all offer quality care.
BG_140	8	"""Most of the medical standards have been annulled, some twice by the Supreme Administrative Court, because of the lack of clear objectives, expected results and impact assessment on the activities of the medical institutions."
BG_140	9	Although adopted with good intentions - to improve the quality of medical care, there is no objective evidence of achieving this goal.
BG_140	10	"Instead, the visible result of their implementation is the conclusion of fictitious employment contracts and the trading of diplomas,"" the minister further noted."
BG_140	11	This is a fact - it is the standards and lack of doctors in certain specialties that have led to distortions where part-time retirees are brought in to work in two places, if only the hospital doesn't lose a clinical pathway.
BG_140	12	Over the years, there have been cases where the doctor had not set foot in his workplace at all.
BG_140	13	"""The ability to perform one or another medical activity depends on the skills and qualifications of individual specialists, not on their numbers."
BG_140	14	"The number of specialists should depend not on a regulation, but on the volume and intensity of work in hospital wards,"" Katsyarov points out."
BG_140	15	This is also the direction of the changes - they replace quantitative indicators with qualitative ones, but there is a danger that in these cases the judgement becomes subjective.
BG_140	16	"For example, in the standard for thoracic surgery, the requirement for a specific number of physicians - e.g., ""at least six physicians, at least three of whom must have a recognized specialty in thoracic surgery"" is replaced by ""at least six physicians, at least three of whom must have a recognized specialty in thoracic surgery"" is replaced by ""physician(s) with a specialty in thoracic surgery, and may also employ physician(s) with another specialty or no specialty, who provide meaningful care for the volume and complexity of work performed."""
BG_140	17	Similar adjustments have been made in other areas.
BG_140	18	EXPECTATIONS.
BG_140	19	"""By reducing unnecessary administrative requirements, medical institutions will gain more operational autonomy, the opportunity to reduce unnecessary costs and increase the salaries of working doctors and nurses,"" Katsarov points out."
BG_140	20	The amendment of the standards will also give more freedom and opportunities in the negotiations between the BMA and the NHIF for national framework contracts.
BG_140	21	They are given the freedom to negotiate specific requirements for each activity without requiring amendments to regulations already issued, he said.
BG_140	22	Despite the elimination of the requirements for the number of different categories of staff in a given structure, there remain requirements for the additional qualifications of doctors, as well as for the volume of activity carried out depending on the levels of competence in hospital care.
BG_140	23	These requirements, combined with the requirements for the available medical equipment and devices, are sufficient to ensure quality medical care for patients, the minister believes.
BG_140	24	REACTIONS.
BG_140	25	The first reaction to the news came from the association of municipal hospitals, which has long been pushing for such changes.
BG_140	26	Dr Nedelcho Totev, Chairman of the Association of Municipal Hospitals, welcomed the change.
BG_140	27	He pointed out that because of this ordinance they had to maintain excess staffing levels without being able to fill the hours, and this made treatment more expensive without contributing to quality.
BG_140	28	"""The word 'quality' was used to bash small hospitals. ..."
BG_140	29	"We have been asking for years to give us a definition of quality, but they are silent,"" the medic said."
BG_143	1	Bulgarian goalkeeper impressed France and Germany
BG_143	2	Thanks to the phenomenal performance of goalkeeper Daniel Naumov Bulgaria lost only 0:3 to the world champion France in the last of its three June controls.
BG_143	3	Apart from 8 key saves, the CSKA 1948 goalkeeper had several other important and successful interventions.
BG_143	4	This allowed the national team to fall with the minimum 0:1 until the 83rd minute.
BG_143	5	But then the reserve Olivier Giroud outpaced Valentin Antov twice in the penalty area and made the final 3:0.
BG_143	6	Shortly before his first shot, Bulgaria missed its only scoring chance, which came from Birsent Karagaren.
BG_143	7	Naumov's performance impressed the media in France and Germany.
BG_143	8	The control at the Stade de France was also closely watched in the second country, as the Bundestag kick off the European Championship with a match against the Roosters on 15 June.
BG_143	9	"""The Bulgarian goalkeeper was often in the centre of events and often managed to come out as the winner from duels with French strikers."
BG_143	10	In the first half, he was helpless after the ball deflected into the head of his teammate Ivaylo Chochev.
BG_143	11	"At the end of the match Giroux cheated Naumov 2 times"", wrote the authoritative German publication ""Kicker""."
BG_143	12	The material got the goalkeeper's club team wrong.
BG_143	13	CSKA-Sofia is listed instead of CSKA 1948.
BG_143	14	"""Giroud's late double marred his performance, but the Bulgarian goalkeeper brilliantly slowed down the end result after making 8 saves."
BG_143	15	Without his exploits Bulgaria would have got the goals much earlier.
BG_143	16	"Naumov disappoints Mbappé 4 times,"" wrote France Football."
BG_143	17	Selector Yassen Petrov released in Paris a squad in which 7 of the players were under 23 years old.
BG_143	18	The youngest - midfielders Dominic Yankov and Ilian Iliev Jr., impressed with very confident ball possession in some moments, especially in the second half.
BG_143	19	In their previous 2 controls since the beginning of the month the national team drew 1:1 with Slovakia and fell 0:1 to Russia in Moscow.
BG_143	20	And they, like France, will participate in the European Championship.
BG_143	21	"""We played against a very strong team."
BG_143	22	The mission was very difficult indeed.
BG_143	23	I saw a lot of class against us.
BG_143	24	We couldn't take advantage of the situation we had at 1:0.
BG_143	25	I can't say the players didn't try.
BG_143	26	We can only win from matches with such opponents.
BG_143	27	For the boys it is an invaluable experience because they have experienced big football.
BG_143	28	We knew where our level was.
BG_143	29	"Thanks to everyone who organized this tour"", commented Yassen Petrov after the friendly meeting."
BG_143	30	"""The Welsh caused us more problems than Bulgaria."
BG_143	31	We are making progress.
BG_143	32	For the players, the presence of fans in the stands was an additional incentive.
BG_143	33	We are on the right track.
BG_143	34	We know what we can do and aim high, but there is no guarantee that we will achieve what we want.
BG_143	35	Of course I'm happy with Giroux.
BG_143	36	He is a proven striker.
BG_143	37	I was planning to run it in less minutes.
BG_143	38	I think Olivier played more against Bulgaria than in the last 3 months in total.
BG_143	39	"We will need his goals at the European Championships,"" France selector Didier Deschamps said in his comments on the match."
BG_143	40	Last week, they also beat Wales 3-0 in another match in preparation for the continental championship.
BG_144	1	Champions of the Rising Sun - Day 15
BG_144	2	The penultimate 15th day of the Olympic Games offered many emotions.
BG_144	3	34 sets of medals were handed out and one of the gold medals went to Bulgaria.
BG_144	4	Stoyka Krasteva recorded an unqualified victory in the boxing final in the up to 51 kg and brought our country a second gold medal in the Japanese capital after that of Ivet Goranova in karate (up to 55 kg).
BG_144	5	Thus Bulgaria is in 34th place in the medal standings, led by China with 87 medals (38 gold), followed by the USA with 108 awards but 36 titles.

BG_152	1	"The Economic and Social Council adopts an opinion on the ""National plan for the introduction of the euro"""
BG_152	2	"The Economic and Social Council of the Republic of Bulgaria adopted at its plenary session an opinion on ""National plan for the introduction of the euro"", the ESC said."
BG_152	3	The opinion underlines that the decision for an accelerated accession to the euro area (EA) is fully confirmed in the current situation when the need for an adequate and timely response to the new geopolitical realities and perspectives comes to the fore.
BG_152	4	In this sense, the Council expresses its full support for the smoothest and least disruptive possible process of introducing the euro in the daily lives of citizens, businesses, municipalities, financial and public institutions, strictly applying the principles set out in the draft National Plan, including efficiency, accountability, transparency, clear rules for currency conversion, security and consumer protection, protection against harm to citizens, minimised public spending and special attention to the most vulnerable.
BG_152	5	The ESC insists that the date set for joining the euro area - 1 January 2024 - be set as an imperative target for short-term macroeconomic and budgetary policy.
BG_152	6	A special emphasis in the opinion is the expectation that the new BNB Act will be adopted in due time.
BG_152	7	The Council is of the opinion that it will provide the necessary clarity on the ways of future disposal of the international foreign exchange reserves, which back the Bulgarian lev and exceed BGN 62 billion as of 29 April 2022.
BG_152	8	In this context, the ESC hopes that the transition from a monetary council regime to full participation in the euro area will be implemented without risks to the macroeconomic, fiscal and financial stability of the country, with maximum transparency and respect for the principle of effective and efficient management of financial resources, both by the government and the central bank.
BG_152	9	The ESC stresses that a requirement for mandatory price labelling in both euro and lev for a period of 12 months should also be put into effect.
BG_152	10	This will help to pre-emptively eliminate concerns about unfair price increases, make it easier for consumers to identify traders and businesses that have allowed themselves to be unduly overcharged, and bring the necessary certainty to consumers that their interests will be protected.
BG_152	11	Once again, the ESC finds a lack of broad public awareness regarding the practical aspects of joining the EZ and a lack of timely, specific and detailed communication with the main obliged parties and stakeholders - municipalities, businesses, providers of specialized services (accounting, software, corporate governance systems, etc.), capital market, commodity exchanges, non-bank financial sector, civil society, consumers, social partners, etc.
BG_152	12	"During the meeting, the Chairperson of the Council, Ms Zornitsa Rusinova, commented that it was with concern that she noticed the delay in the process and the opinions that were creeping into society. ""Our opinion is unanimous on the subject and we hope that the expertise available to the ESC will help to facilitate the overall procedure."""
BG_152	13	Rusinova added that in June a special analysis is to be prepared, assigned to the Council by the National Assembly, on the impact of Bulgaria's accession to the euro area and in this sense the current opinion will be extremely useful.
BG_152	14	At the plenary session a new vice-chair of the ESC was unanimously elected from the group of employers' organizations in the person of Ms Maria Mincheva from the Bulgarian Industrial Association.
BG_159	1	Big business: the gas situation could blow up plans for a new cabinet and possibly a caretaker one
BG_159	2	The line, according to the industrialists, is blue and is the difficult situation with securing natural gas for Bulgaria.
BG_159	3	Businesses are worried that less than 3 months before the start of the heating season blue fuel for Bulgaria is not secured and its price is absolutely unclear.
BG_159	4	No effective measures have been taken by the government. , BFEC believes.
BG_159	5	"""We, the representatives of the manufacturing enterprises in the country, listened to the claims that the Bulgarian economy was not a big consumer, that it was not a big deal and we would not be without gas."
BG_159	6	"Obviously, these mantras are uttered by people at a high level, who have no idea how many enterprises in the country depend entirely on natural gas, how many families they provide a livelihood and how many individuals are heated with natural gas and for them too there is practically no alternative for the winter"", the letter further says and gives advice to first know the Bulgarian economy before talking and even more - to act."
BG_159	7	"""We are far from sounding dramatic, but without natural gas supplies many working people will be on the streets, the economy will be extremely threatened and the state budget will not be able to cover a large part of social payments,"" the industrialists say."
BG_159	8	It is recalled that the CEO of Bulgargas stated at his hearing in the National Assembly that the quantities needed for the economy for August and September are not guaranteed.
BG_159	9	It is not clear how the delivery of these quantities is negotiated.
BG_159	10	There is also absolutely no information on whether long-term gas supplies are being negotiated, including from 1 January 2023.
BG_159	11	"""Even with Azerbaijan receiving its full gas volumes, the global market is in deficit - we are seeing breakdowns, strikes and planned outages at key suppliers' facilities."
BG_159	12	We are seeing an oversupply of LNG regasification terminals in Europe.
BG_159	13	"Many of the ""alternative"" suppliers have virtually no spare gas to sell beyond their long-term commitments."
BG_159	14	These circumstances make us far from optimistic about the possibility of securing gas for Bulgaria.
BG_159	15	Against this background, it is not clear whether there is gas to be injected into Chiren.
BG_159	16	According to public data, the Chiren PGH is 38% full, while the European average is 62%!
BG_159	17	In Germany, the average occupancy rate is 65%, with a number of storage facilities there over 90% full.
BG_159	18	Let's not forget that we are in the middle of the summer season when consumption is relatively low.
BG_159	19	What will happen in the winter months when fuel has to be supplied to the heating plants?!
BG_159	20	Many questions that should have been answered yesterday, the BFEC believes and recalls that they warned about these risks in early March with a letter to the prime minister and ministers and asked for the creation of a crisis headquarters with the participation of consumers, which would prepare an action plan in case of a suspension of supplies from Russia.
BG_159	21	"""This letter once again demands crisis measures and an urgent meeting to clarify the situation!"
BG_159	22	"We warn that the gas shutdown, in addition to its detrimental effects on the economy, creates significant risks for technological accidents and the protection of the environment and human life!"""
BG_159	23	, are the final words of big industry.
BG_161	1	Minister Lazarov:
BG_161	2	Over 310 000 people will receive heating benefits
BG_161	3	"""Over 310 000 people will receive targeted heating assistance in the coming winter season."
BG_161	4	To date, nearly 196 000 applications have been submitted for such support.
BG_161	5	"Of these, 108 000 have been approved and the rest are being processed."""
BG_161	6	This was said by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Policy Lazar Lazarov at a press conference to present Deputy Ministers Nadia Klisurska, Natalia Efremova and Prof.
BG_161	7	Emil Mingov and the ministry's priorities in the mandate of the caretaker government, the ministry said Each person who is eligible for the aid will receive a total of 623.55 BGN for the period 1 November 2022 - 31 March 2023, which is 100 BGN or nearly 20% more than last heating season.
BG_161	8	"""The higher amount of aid will start to be paid from August 15,"" Minister Lazarov explained."
BG_161	9	"""We will strive to use all possible resources to provide support to people and families on low incomes."
BG_161	10	One of the essential instruments in this direction is the Food and Basic Material Assistance Programme approved by the European Commission for the programming period 2021-2027.
BG_161	11	"We will have BGN 411.7 million under the programme, which will provide various types of support to over 600 thousand people,"" Minister Lazarov said."
BG_161	12	The programme aims to distribute 350 000 food parcels and hygiene materials each year, as well as providing hot lunches to over 50 000 low-income people all year round.
BG_161	13	The programme also includes 2 new areas to support poor families with children by providing essential baby products for over 10,000 newborns and baby kitchen vouchers for 10,000 children.
BG_161	14	"""From 1 September we are ready to invite municipalities to apply for the provision of hot lunch so that there is no interruption in the service."
BG_161	15	"In parallel, work is underway to launch public procurement procedures for the selection of suppliers of food packages and hygiene materials,"" Deputy Minister Natalia Efremova explained."
BG_161	16	Minister Lazarov pointed out that the ministry will propose that the poverty line for 2023 be raised to 504 BGN, which is a 22% increase compared to its current level.
BG_161	17	The new size is defined by Eurostat's Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey, which makes the poverty line an adequate, measurable and comparable tool suitable for use in different dimensions of social policy.
BG_161	18	"""We have already taken action to link social benefits to the poverty line, explained Lazarov."
BG_161	19	Deputy Minister Klisurska added that the estimates show that by linking benefits to the poverty line the number of people receiving them will increase from the current 63 000 to 86 000 in 2023.
BG_161	20	"""For 2024, the forecast is that their number will reach 105,000 people,"" she added."
BG_161	21	As a priority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Minister Lazarov also pointed out the limitation of the negative effects on the labour market.
BG_161	22	"""We will strive to increase the employment rate and create conditions for more people to find their livelihood."
BG_161	23	The main focus in this area will be on supporting the employment of young people, people with disabilities and people in pre-retirement.
BG_161	24	"Our efforts will also be directed to the reserve of the labour market - the inactive persons"", Minister Lazarov stressed."
BG_161	25	He added that the first schemes of the Human Resources Development Programme (2021-2027) will provide employment for at least 50 000 people.
BG_161	26	"""Conditions will be created to support more than 40 000 children and young people to get a chance for fulfillment in society."
BG_161	27	"A major focus will be on ensuring continuity of services for the elderly and people who cannot care for themselves,"" Minister Lazarov said."
BG_161	28	Priority will also be given to the implementation of the commitments in the Recovery and Sustainability Plan, which relate to reforms in social assistance, the modernisation of the long-term care system for the elderly and people with disabilities and the creation of a digital training platform for over 500,000 people.
BG_161	29	Minister Lazarov also said that following the principles in the draft directive for adequate minimum wages, the MLSP will propose to the social partners that the amount of the minimum wage in 2023 should be 50% of the average wage for the previous year, which is BGN 770.
BG_161	30	"""This is a basic option for discussion."
BG_161	31	"Discussions on the issue will take place in the coming months"", he stressed."
BG_165	1	By a rally-ceremony Byala celebrated the 145th anniversary of the Liberation
BG_165	2	The 145th anniversary of the Liberation of Bulgaria and the 146th anniversary of the Liberation of the town from the Ottoman yoke were celebrated with a solemn rally-ceremony late last night in Byala.
BG_165	3	Byala was the second larger Bulgarian settlement after Svishtov to be liberated from Ottoman rule.
BG_165	4	It is because of this fact that it is considered the first capital of the newly liberated Bulgarian land.
BG_165	5	"""On the eve of March 3, when we bow to the memory of the heroes who gave their lives for our freedom, let us remember their devotion to their homeland, as well as the valour and determination of the builders of modern Bulgaria."
BG_165	6	Today, we need to ask ourselves again about our responsibility to them, and to the future of the country, remembering that the most valuable lesson bequeathed by our ancestors is unity around national ideals.
BG_165	7	"This is how we will prove with our deeds that we are really a strong people - proud of our past, but also responsible for our own tomorrow,"" wrote the Governor of Ruse Anatoly Stanev in his congratulatory address to the Mayor of Byala Dimitar Slavov on the occasion of the holiday."
BG_165	8	"""It depends on the choices we make, the decisions we take, the values we uphold, whether we will follow with reason and wisdom the dignified behavior of our ancestors and act statesmanlike, working for the good of society and with the next generation of Bulgaria in mind,"" added Stanev."
BG_165	9	A wreath was also laid on his behalf at the Memorial to the Fallen Heroes of War.
BG_165	10	The ceremony, hosted by the Mayor of the Municipality, was also attended by representatives of the Regional Administration - Ruse.
BG_165	11	"Among the official guests were the Head of the National Military University ""Vasil Levski"" Brigadier General Ivan Malamov, the Head of the Military District - 1st Degree Lieutenant Colonel Vasil Petrov, the Head of the Regional Department of Education Dr. Rositsa Georgieva, the Director of the Secretariat of the Regional Council of the Bulgarian Red Cross Antoaneta Yabanozova, the Mayors of Dve Mogili and Borovo Bozhidar Borisov and Valentin Panayotov, a number of representatives of the local and state authorities from the region and the neighboring settlements, as well as the parish priest of Byala Father Georgi Stoyanov."
BG_165	12	In his speech the Mayor of Byala Dimitar Slavov recalled many historical facts and noted that March 3 is a holy national holiday, not only because it is one of the first holidays that the newly liberated Bulgarian state introduced in its calendar, but because it is a symbol of the restored Bulgarian statehood.
BG_165	13	He also noted that we should be grateful to all the peoples who gave their lives for freedom and recalled the feat of Baroness Julia Vrevska and the heroism of the volunteers, including those from Byala and the region.
BG_165	14	"""For six months, the volunteers who stopped with their breasts and bodies the enemy's advance, the boys who laid at the altar of the fatherland their unlived lives, their unfulfilled dreams, their unfulfilled personal happiness - the brave men who with their exploits recorded our brightest page in the new Bulgarian history - the first page of its freedom, are our pride."
BG_165	15	The belief that we will finally be free gives wings to all the post-liberation attempts of the Bulgarian people to restore the integrity of their suffering homeland.
BG_165	16	"This faith and this hope gave courage to the Bulgarians to make their reunion and to carry on their shoulders the heaviest part of the Balkan wars and the First World War,"" the mayor said."
BG_165	17	He also raised the issue of human empathy both for the refugees from Ukraine and for the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, but pointed out that today Bulgarians are more divided than ever.
BG_165	18	"""We are divided by red lines, by political hatred, envy, pettiness, but we have a choice whether to unite today on our National Day, whether to face as a proud nation with a glorious history the challenge of our time - wars, earthquakes, pandemics, economic and political crises, or to continue to sink into the swamp of malice and hatred,"" Slavov added."
BG_165	19	"""Let us remember, let us be united, let us carry in our hearts the proud Bulgarian spirit, because only the love for Bulgaria can unite us and give us the strength to keep pure our brightest national ideal,"" the mayor of Byala was adamant."
BG_165	20	The initiative, which has been organized by Byala Municipality with the assistance of the National Military University for more than half a century, continued with a solemn evening inspection, as well as with paying tribute to the liberators and founders of the Bulgarian state by representative blocks of the National Military University in Veliko Tarnovo.
BG_165	21	The ceremony ended with a festive fireworks display.
BG_169	1	Rulers messed up and the alarmists
BG_169	2	November 1 is an official Bulgarian holiday - the Day of the National Awakeners, but since it is not a holiday for everyone else, except for schoolchildren and students, it passes by unnoticed, with some speech or other.
BG_169	3	The reason is that it appears on a strange date and has no patron, which is far from the original intention.
BG_169	4	Celebration of the National Awakeners began in Plovdiv in 1909.
BG_169	5	Then on November 1 is the church feast of St.
BG_169	6	John of Rila, the awakener and spiritual patron of the Bulgarian people.
BG_169	7	In 1916 the secular authorities adopted the Gregorian calendar.
BG_169	8	The dates shift - April 1, 1916 according to the Julian calendar becomes April 14 according to the Gregorian calendar.
BG_169	9	However, the Church does not accept the so-called new style, it remains on the Julian calendar.
BG_169	10	St.
BG_169	11	John of Rila also remains on November 1.
BG_169	12	In 1922, an initiative group of intellectuals, including writers Ivan Vazov and Stoyan Chilingirov, professors Lyubomir Miletich and Benyo Tsonev, actresses Adriana Budevska and Elena Svezhina, proposed that November 1 - the church day of the saint, officially become the day of the national awakeners.
BG_169	13	The name is invented by prof.
BG_169	14	Boyan Penev.
BG_169	15	It is a day of tribute to those patriots who have awakened the people through word and arms, fought for faith, language and freedom.
BG_169	16	"It is the day of ""the giants of the invincible Bulgarian spirit, of the creators of the native speech, thought and historical glory, of the activists for the national awakening""."
BG_169	17	The name list begins with Paisii Hilendarski, includes Grigoriy Tsamblak, Konstantin Kostenetsky, Vladislav Gramatik, Matej Gramatik, Neofit Bozveli, Dimitar and Konstantin Miladinov, Georgi Rakovski, Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev, Stefan Karadja, Hadji Dimitar, Lyuben Karavelov, Dobri Chintulov and many others.
BG_169	18	In it is St.
BG_169	19	John of Rila, later Ivan Vazov was added.
BG_169	20	The Minister of Education is Stoyan Omarchevski, who submits the proposal to the government.
BG_169	21	"On 31 October, Prime Minister Alexander Stamboliiski signed a decree designating the next day as ""a day of Bulgarian Enlighteners, a day to pay tribute to the memory of the great Bulgarians, distant and close builders of modern Bulgaria""."
BG_169	22	In December, Parliament passed a law to supplement the Holidays and Sunday Rest Act.
BG_169	23	In February of the following year, King Boris III signed the law, the proclamation reading.
BG_169	24	"John of Rila to become the Day of the National Awakeners, a celebration of the great Bulgarians to awaken in the young a common sense of existence and interest in the figures of our past""."
BG_169	25	Common sense is awakened in the young until 1945.
BG_169	26	The new communist government abolished the holiday - duplicated May 24.
BG_169	27	The celebration of the revivalists was restored in 1992.
BG_169	28	It is recorded on 1 November - a public holiday and a non-working day for all educational institutions.
BG_169	29	Only something has happened in the meantime.
BG_169	30	Since 1968 the Holy Synod has adopted a reform of the Bulgarian church calendar, the so-called Corrected Julian Calendar.
BG_169	31	Then on December 19, St. Nicholas Day is celebrated.
BG_169	32	13 days of the so-called liturgical round are skipped and on December 20 it is already Ignazhden.
BG_169	33	From the following year, most saints' days are moved (St. Nicholas Day, for example, is on December 6).
BG_169	34	From 1 November the day of St.
BG_169	35	John of Rila goes on October 19.
BG_169	36	Thus, when lawmakers restored the feast of the revivalists on November 1, it hung without a patron.
BG_169	37	It remains somewhat anonymous who these awakeners are who are being celebrated.
BG_169	38	The situation does not change, although two unions sew two more days - a day of Bulgarian science and a day of Bulgarian journalism.
BG_169	39	In 2002, President Georgi Parvanov tried to breathe life into the country by starting to perform rituals - raising of the national flag in front of the presidential entrance and ceremonial changing of the guard.
BG_169	40	Some parties and universities organise celebrations and processions.

BG_170	5	Postbank has once again consolidated its position as a socially responsible company by joining the institutions that have signed the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) within the framework of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).This significant step makes Postbank the only financial institution in Bulgaria that has chosen to be guided in all aspects of its activities by the unified framework for sustainable development in the banking sector, developed through the innovative partnership between leading banking
BG_170	6	Joining the institutions that have signed the Principles for Responsible Banking is an extremely important success for us, because it gives us recognition that we are putting into practice global standards for sustainable development in the financial sector.
BG_170	7	At our bank, we follow a strict policy of tracking environmental risk in corporate lending, thereby also encouraging our clients to be responsible with the businesses they create and manage.
BG_170	8	Corporate sustainability and responsibility is a value that is recognized by all markets, gives high recognition to a company's business vision and differentiates it from all others.
BG_170	9	"We are glad that with local actions we can help to achieve global and important goals for the whole society"", commented from Postbank."
BG_170	10	The Principles bring together more than 190 banks from different countries, including leading global financial institutions such as Santander, Nordea, ING Bank, Commerzbank, Citi and Deutsche Bank, or more than a third of the global banking industry.
BG_170	11	The Principles for Responsible Banking define the role and responsibility of the banking sector in shaping a sustainable future and aligning the banking sector with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
BG_170	12	Postbank joined the Financial Initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme in 2013 and the Bulgarian Network of the United Nations Global Compact in 2017, thus contributing to compliance with environmental legislation in Bulgaria and further expanding its initiatives to support society and the environment.
BG_170	13	For almost 30 years, investing in sustainable development has been a core part of the financial institution's business.
BG_170	14	For more on the Principles for Responsible Banking, see The United Nations Environment Programme was established in 1972 in Stockholm and has a mandate to promote economic growth consistent with the priority goal of protecting the environment.
BG_170	15	The UNEP Finance Initiative was born in 1991, when a small group of commercial banks joined the UN's efforts to catalyze environmental ideas in the sector.
BG_170	16	The initiative facilitates dialogue between a wide range of financial institutions, including commercial banks, investment banks, funds, international development banks and agencies, and contributes to achieving a balance between economic growth, environmental protection and sustainable development.
BG_170	17	An additional UN objective is to stimulate private investment in clean technologies and services.
BG_170	18	"Postbank, with the legal name ""Eurobank Bulgaria"" AD, is the fourth largest bank in Bulgaria, with a wide branch network throughout the country and a significant customer base of individuals, companies and institutions."
BG_170	19	It has almost 30 years of presence among the leaders of the banking market in Bulgaria.
BG_170	20	The bank has been a leading factor in innovation and shaping trends in the country's banking sector in recent years and has been repeatedly awarded for its innovations.
BG_170	21	Postbank occupies a strategic position in retail and corporate banking in Bulgaria.
BG_170	22	The bank has one of the best developed branch networks and modern alternative banking channels.
BG_177	1	Projects for over 180 billion euros apply for the Three Seas, so far the money is 1 billion euros
BG_177	2	Four proposals are Bulgarian, one of them has already been funded.
BG_177	3	Projects worth €180.9 billion have already applied for funding to the 3SIIF investment fund, set up under the Three Seas Initiative.
BG_177	4	This became clear on Friday at the conclusion of the Sixth Summit of the initiative, which was held in the National Palace of Culture.
BG_177	5	At the final press conference with the participation of the Presidents of Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland and Romania, a declaration of the meeting was presented, one of the points of which was that a public platform for the progress of the projects was created.
BG_177	6	The. platform. in. question. does. not. give. access. to. a. description. of. the. projects. themselves,. but. the. summary. shows. that. so. far. a. total. of. 90. projects. worth. €180.9. billion. have. applied. for. funding. 49%. of. the. projects. by. value. are. transport,. 37%. are. energy,. and. 14%. are. digitisation. projects.
BG_177	7	According to the latest data, the 3SIIF fund has raised €1 billion so far, which is expected to reach €2 billion by the end of the year.
BG_177	8	The plans foresee the fund's capital to reach 15-20 billion euros in a few years, but this will attract additional private capital of around 100 billion euros.
BG_177	9	In addition, the fund is revolving and part of the allocated funds are repaid over time and can be used again to finance projects.
BG_177	10	Poland presented the largest number of projects - 11.
BG_177	11	Bulgaria has four projects so far, one of which was submitted in the last two months and has not yet been approved, and. one has. already. been. approved.
BG_177	12	We are talking about the acquisition of a large solar park in the village of Karadjalovo in Primay, where the Austrian Enery is an investor and this was announced about a month ago.
BG_177	13	During the Sofia summit, the fund's executive director Joe Phillips said that so far the projects that have been fully approved and allocated funds are two more - one in Poland and one in Estonia.
BG_177	14	The first is for the development of the Polish locomotive leasing platform Kargoyunit, which was established in 2003 and is one of the six largest such companies in the EU.
BG_177	15	The second deal is for the completion and commissioning of the Tallinn Greenenergy data centre.
BG_177	16	In this, the fund bought out most of the shares of the previous private owners of the unfinished project, leaving them with less than 10% of the shares.
BG_177	17	The value of both projects, as well as the Bulgarian one, is not publicly disclosed because these are the rules of the fund, but according to market data, in all three cases it is about 100 million euros.
BG_177	18	During the Sofia meeting, interim Economy Minister Kiril Petkov gave the idea to create an additional investment fund aimed at innovation and new technologies, while President Rumen Radev said that. innovation. and. education. should. also. become. priorities. of. the. initiative,. as. are. transport,. energy. and. digitalization.
BG_177	19	The final declaration from Sofia, however, does not mention these ideas.
BG_180	1	Ilhan Kyuchyuk:
BG_180	2	EU values are the unifying factor for the Western Balkans
BG_180	3	Kyuchyuk again called on Bulgaria and North Macedonia to finally resume constructive dialogue.
BG_180	4	"""The EU-Western Balkans summit is a historic and successful lesson for Europe because in this way we show the region that every obstacle can be overcome in the commitment to the enlargement process and full EU membership is our common ultimate goal."""
BG_180	5	"""The EU's commitment to provide nearly 30 billion euros in grants and investments over seven years to support development and to push the Western Balkan countries towards membership is a real proof that we stand side by side with our partners"", the MEP added."
BG_180	6	In his words, however, the enlargement process depends not only on the level of economic growth, but also on many other factors, among which are the rule of law, democracy and good neighbourly relations.
BG_180	7	"""The provocation on the border between Kosovo and Serbia shows us how fragile peace is in the region, as well as the difficulties between Bulgaria and North Macedonia in finding a compromise on the bilateral dispute, show us what is the role of the past in the region."
BG_180	8	And I believe that we must continue to support the Western Balkans in implementing all these necessary reforms, because the European Union and adherence to its values and standards remain the biggest unifying factor for the region.
BG_180	9	I call on North Macedonia and Bulgaria to finally resume constructive dialogue in order to achieve sustainable results.
BG_180	10	"Otherwise, any further delay will jeopardise the credibility, objectivity and reliability of the accession process,"" Kyuchyuk added in his statement."
BG_180	11	During the debate in the plenary, the Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets, Mareid McGuinness, was also present on the Commission side.
BG_180	12	She categorically stated that the EU-Western Balkans summit has become an opportunity because the EU and the region have a common responsibility to build a common future.
BG_180	13	"""The enlargement process is a strategic objective that unites the whole region and the EU."
BG_180	14	A declaration was adopted in which we agreed on a number of measures related to the implementation of the economic and investment plan.
BG_180	15	It covers a number of priority areas - innovation, research, culture, education, sport, as well as preventing brain drain from the region.
BG_180	16	We also have a detailed implementation plan for the Green Programme.
BG_180	17	"These are tangible results for the citizens in the region, but they also show our deep commitment to the European perspective of the Western Balkans"", Mared McGuinness was adamant."
BG_181	1	Ivan Granitski, BSP:
BG_181	2	The date of the April Uprising should be a national holiday
BG_181	3	The historical contribution of the April Uprising remains underestimated, especially in recent years.
BG_181	4	"This was said by Ivan Granitski, MP from the civil quota of the BSP for Bulgaria, founder of the publishing house ""Zahari Stoyanov"", corresponding member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, for the program ""Sofia Tribune"" on Radio ""Focus""."
BG_181	5	"""Alas, in Bulgaria for the last 20-30 years we see that there is a lotophagy, an obliviousness to the important historical events that are related to our destiny."""
BG_181	6	"""For many years, we have been convinced that in order to join the EU, we have to give up all or part of our national history."
BG_181	7	Because, in my opinion, it is viciously and incorrectly infiltrated into Bulgarian society, or at least they are trying to impose the theme that the EU is a union of regions, not of nations, not of the fatherland.
BG_181	8	That is to say, for years and until now the idea of the founding fathers of the EU has been replaced.
BG_181	9	De Gaulle and Mitterrand, and Kohl, have said - Europe of fatherlands, not of regions.
BG_181	10	"That is, the EU can be strong and united, but national specificity and identity must not be suppressed."""
BG_181	11	Ivan Granitski is adamant that when we are distinctive and unique in our identity, we will be stronger.
BG_181	12	"""Especially we, if we give up our national history, which of course carries the historical messages of 7 great civilizations - Ancient Greek, Roman, Thracian, Byzantine, Proto-Bulgarian, Slavic, we would be poor."
BG_181	13	And from this point of view it is natural that such dates as April 20, as the landmark dates related to our national revival, to the Liberation, to the recent and more distant history, are extremely important.
BG_181	14	So, of course, it is good to adopt the date as a national holiday.
BG_181	15	"My thesis and pain is that today as a society, as a country, we suffer from national lotophagy, national nihilism"", commented the founder of the publishing house ""Zahari Stoyanov""."
BG_181	16	Ivan Granitski believes that all Bulgarian parties should be patriotic.
BG_181	17	"""The trouble is that the supposedly left-wing and supposedly right-wing parties have turned their backs on the national element,"" the writer says."
BG_181	18	In his words, the national interest should be the cause not only of an individual MP, an individual party, but of the whole parliament.
BG_181	19	"""This should be a state strategy."
BG_181	20	Personally, I will work for a sensible, national conversation.
BG_181	21	God forbid that a consensus be reached between the different political forces in this parliament, although it is very fragmented.
BG_181	22	We should put aside narrow party, corporate, personal interests and reflect, not to say unite, but at least reflect, the political forces represented, in the direction of what are the main national goals, interests, even priorities, if we decide.
BG_181	23	That would be soul-saving.
BG_181	24	Ivan Granitski confirmed that one of his causes in the 45th National Assembly will be related to the adoption of the Law for the Protection of the Bulgarian Language.
BG_181	25	He recalled that the idea was not new, as such projects had been proposed since the time of Nikolai Haitov, more than 20 years ago.
BG_181	26	The Union of Bulgarian Writers has proposed such options, and in the last parliament VMRO also had a draft, but it has never been adopted into law.
BG_181	27	"""Such a law for the protection of the Bulgarian language would be very important because it does not only concern the Bulgarian language, it concerns the way of thinking, the attitude towards history, towards national culture, towards national traditions, i.e. such a law would be a very productive, very workable law in principle for the protection of Bulgarian culture and identity.""Ivan Granitski expressed doubt that the new parliament will have a long life, but if committees for science, education, culture are constructed and they work, they should adopt not only the Law on the Bulgarian Language, but also the Law on Radio and Television, which was prepared by the last parliament and is good."
BG_181	28	In his words, lexical legislation should protect the language from depersonalization, from drying up, from losing its spirit.
BG_181	29	"""In the last few decades our language has been quite impoverished, administratively flawed, I am not just talking about the official, administrative language or the language of the National Assembly, alas, the language of the media is quite impoverished."
BG_181	30	You may recall that years ago there was research into what the language of newspapers and the media was 100 years ago.
BG_181	31	It turned out to be more than 20 times depleted.
BG_181	32	If 100 years ago they had 10-15 thousand vocabulary words, the current media use 800-1000 words.
BG_181	33	It is about tragic impoverishment.
BG_181	34	And when language is poor, it is a function of poor thought.
BG_181	35	Ivan Granitski commented that one of the reasons for the poor vocabulary is the functional illiteracy that is observed in the graduates of secondary education in recent years.
BG_181	36	According to him, young people are reading less and less because of the reduction of the curricula, throwing out classics from Bulgarian literature and history, which rather borders on falsification.
BG_181	37	"""The result is sad,"" says writer Ivan Granitsky."
BG_183	1	Swap of chief positions in BDZ
BG_183	2	The new - old Executive Director of BDZ Georgi Drumev and Margarita Petrova-Caridi - Chairman of the Board of Directors.
BG_183	3	There has been a change of top positions in the management of BDZ Holding.
BG_183	4	As of Friday Georgi Drumev is the new executive director of the state-owned railways and Margarita Petrova-Karidi is the chairwoman of the Board of Directors, the Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications (MTITC) said.
BG_183	5	The two take the places of Nikola Vassilev and Grigori Grigorov, who were dismissed from their posts by caretaker Transport Minister Georgi Todorov at the end of June.
BG_183	6	The motive for their dismissal was the worsening performance of BDZ Holding compared to 2020, the delays of passenger trains, the poor organisation of freight transport, the delayed modernisation of locomotives and irregularities in public procurement.
BG_183	7	Georgi Drumev and Margarita Petrova-Karidi previously joined the board of directors of the railways as independent members after a competition held by the Agency for Public Enterprises and Control.
BG_183	8	Georgi Drumev was CEO of Holding BDZ for four months in 2017 during the caretaker government of Ognian Gerdzhikov, appointed by President Rumen Radev.
BG_183	9	After the arrival of the third GERB cabinet he was replaced.
BG_183	10	Before that - during the cabinet of Plamen Oresharski, which was supported by BSP and DPS, Georgi Drumev was the manager of BDZ Freight in the period 2013-2014.
BG_183	11	During this time the state of the BDZ was also not good.
BG_183	12	Now the main priorities in Georgi Drumev's work will be to improve the implementation of the train running schedule by providing reliable and safe rolling stock and to increase the quality of the service offered, said the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
BG_183	13	The transport ministry presents him as a specialist in the field of railways with many years of experience in the system, without mentioning the positions he has held so far.
BG_183	14	It is also said that he has managerial experience in commercial companies of the Ministry of Defence without specifying which ones.
BG_183	15	A check of public records shows that in the period 2019 - 2020.
BG_183	16	"Georgi Drumev was the manager of the state arms factories ""Terem Khan Krem"" and ""Terem Ovech"", which is now liquidated."
BG_183	17	Georgi Drumev graduated from the Todor Kableshkov Military Transport School with a degree in Technology and Organization of Railway Transport.
BG_183	18	Margarita Petrova-Karidi was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of BDZ Holding.
BG_183	19	The Department of Transportation did not provide any details about her biography.
BG_183	20	From the public information about her it becomes clear that for many years she worked in the banks Piraeus and DSK, rising to the position of CEO.
BG_183	21	She graduated from Mathematical High School and the University of Economics with a degree in Banking and Corporate Finance.
BG_183	22	It is not clear what Caridi's reason is for switching from banking to state-owned railways, which are in dire financial straits and pay significantly less.
BG_183	23	"In addition to Georgi Drumev and Margarita Petrova-Karidi, the Board of Directors with a mandate until February 3, 2024 includes also the ""fired"" Grigori Grigorov and Svetlomir Nikolov, a reference in the Commercial Register shows."
BG_183	24	In the announcement of the Ministry of Transport and Communications it is stated that competitions are currently held for the election of new members to fill the Board of Directors of Holding BDZ EAD.
BG_183	25	According to unofficial information of Mediapool, the competitions are for the seats of Nikola Vassilev and Grigori Grigorov.
BG_183	26	The two joined the board of directors in late 2018 following a decision by the then
BG_188	1	Antoaneta Tsoneva: We need to solve the artificially created problems with...
BG_188	2	Sofia.
BG_188	3	The Ministry of Education and Science (MES) within one month to remove the obstacles created by itself for the study in higher education in Bulgaria of Bulgarians from historical communities abroad.
BG_188	4	This was requested by the chairwoman of the Parliamentary Committee on Policies for Bulgarians Abroad Antoaneta Tsoneva at a meeting of the committee on Wednesday.
BG_188	5	"Representatives of the Society of Bessarabian and Tavrian Bulgarians ""Rodolyubets"" announced that 241 prospective students, almost a quarter of all applicants, were not admitted last year to competitions for study in Bulgaria, the press center of ""Democratic Bulgaria"" reported."
BG_188	6	For the academic year 2021-2022, 2150 places are planned for Bulgarians from the historical Bulgarian communities abroad.
BG_188	7	The problem is that the 103rd decree of the Council of Ministers from 1993, regulating educational activities among Bulgarians from abroad, for the first time receives a new interpretation.
BG_188	8	And this with the rules of the Ministry of Education and Science, which refuse admission to people who have already acquired Bulgarian citizenship or have been granted permanent resident status in Bulgaria.
BG_188	9	Thus the paradox arises that some students, while studying and at the same time have changed their status from long-term residents to permanent residents, or have already taken citizenship, are no longer allowed to continue their studies under the same conditions - they lose their scholarship, dormitory, etc.
BG_188	10	In practice, people have to give up their Bulgarian citizenship in order to study in Bulgaria.
BG_188	11	Galina Drenovska, director of the Higher Education Directorate at the Ministry of Education, announced that a change in the 103rd decree last month solved the problem of people in a backward situation.
BG_188	12	And all those who have entered bachelor's, master's and doctoral programmes will be able to complete them, regardless of whether they have acquired Bulgarian citizenship in the meantime.
BG_188	13	But he admitted that the problem of permanent residents and those who came to Bulgaria with Bulgarian citizenship remained unresolved.
BG_188	14	"""We have sent letters to all institutions, a working group will be formed on the initiative of the prime minister to make legal changes, but I do not know whether the changes will be a fact for the upcoming candidate campaign,"" Drenovska said."
BG_188	15	"""We are shooting a fly with a gun, we have to find a more direct way"", Antoaneta Tsoneva said indignantly."
BG_188	16	According to him, there is no need now to change the Law on Bulgarians living outside Bulgaria, which is already very outdated and is to be revised fundamentally after the results of a subsequent impact assessment commissioned by the National Centre for Parliamentary Studies.
BG_188	17	"""I propose that we settle the matter discreetly and more quickly by bylaw so that we do not lose another academic year."
BG_188	18	The approach must be supportive of these people!
BG_188	19	Convey the general will of the committee and let's find a solution in a month!
BG_188	20	""", Tsoneva said."
BG_188	21	"Principal Drenovska promised to ""take another look with our lawyers to see what can be done in one school year,"" and the representatives from the Patriots were satisfied with the outcome of the case."
BG_188	22	In front of the parliamentary committee, Deputy Foreign Minister Velislava Petrova presented how the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad will be integrated, which is now part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an executive agency.
BG_188	23	The agency's budget and staffing remain within the parameters of last year, but it must now work more closely with our consulates abroad.
BG_188	24	Antoaneta Tsoneva recalled that public councils should be formed at our diplomatic missions, as provided by law.
BG_188	25	He added that Bulgarians abroad have long been asking about the lack of these public councils.
BG_188	26	"""Through them, our communities will know that the Bulgarian state sees them,"" he said."
BG_188	27	-Minister Chair of the Committee.
BG_188	28	He reminded that there should even be a national council of the Bulgarian communities abroad.
BG_188	29	Velislava Petrova said that her department was willing to make this happen and promised to start the work on the creation of public councils first in countries with larger Bulgarian communities.
BG_194	1	Georgi Sabev:
BG_194	2	The exchange of experience and knowledge between Member States is key
BG_194	3	The exchange of agricultural experience and knowledge between Member States is key to the competitiveness of farmers.
BG_194	4	The widespread use of innovation by farmers is essential to achieving a sustainable agricultural sector in our country.
BG_194	5	This was stated by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture Georgi Sabev during the meeting of the agricultural advisors from the EU member states.
BG_194	6	The event was organised by the European Commission, DG Agriculture and the EIP Support Unit AGRI (European Partnership for Agricultural Innovation) and was attended by experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS).
BG_194	7	Its aim is to find partners and network between advisors, farmers, researchers to support the preparation for Horizon Europe's advisor networks.
BG_194	8	"Deputy Minister Sabev added that in order to achieve this goal, as well as to improve the interaction in the chain ""Research - agricultural advice - agribusiness"", the main role will be played by the networks and advisory services in the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the press centre of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food reported."
BG_194	9	"""Other challenges include improving cooperation between farmers and the processing sector, and ensuring market access for smallholder farmers through the development of short supply chains."
BG_194	10	"Local markets are very important for unlocking the economic potential of regional traditional foods,"" the Deputy Minister added."
BG_194	11	He explained that adaptation to climate change needed to be achieved by implementing environmentally friendly and climate-friendly agricultural practices.
BG_194	12	"""Among the objectives for Bulgaria is the development of organic farming, as well as the promotion of innovation, digitalization, modernization of advisory services, and the development of the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS),"" Deputy Minister Georgi Sabev further informed."
BG_194	13	In his view, it is necessary to reduce the income gap between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy, as well as between small and medium-sized farms compared to larger ones.
BG_194	14	The deputy agricultural minister stressed that ensuring balanced territorial development, respectively development of agricultural holdings in mountainous regions and regions with natural or other specific constraints is a goal Bulgaria should strive for.
BG_194	15	In conclusion, Deputy Minister Georgi Sabev summarized that it is important to create a risk and crisis management framework for the prevention of natural disasters, diseases and insurance instruments.
BG_194	16	"""I hope that this event will also be a good networking opportunity for future partnerships in the field of agricultural advisory services and innovation to achieve efficient and modern agriculture across Europe,"" concluded Sabev."
BG_197	1	Djankov proposes a commission with Ivan Kostov and Plamen Oresharski to exit the crisis
BG_197	2	An independent commission of economists, financiers and experts should be established to help Boyko Borissov's government overcome the coronary crisis.
BG_197	3	It should include people who overcame crises in Bulgaria's governance, such as former prime ministers and finance ministers Ivan Kostov and Plamen Oresharski, as well as proven experts like Djankov himself.
BG_197	4	This idea was launched on Sunday by former finance minister in the Borisov 1 cabinet Simeon Dyankov.
BG_197	5	"He is adamant that the current government of Boyko Borissov is ""running after the crisis""."
BG_197	6	The government is just running after the crisis instead of saying - we are in a situation of a big crisis.
BG_197	7	"The reason is that there are no economists in the government to say in previous crises what measures were taken and to identify measures before the situation became worse,"" the financier clarified."
BG_197	8	From Djankov's words it became clear that he himself is ready to participate in such a committee and is already a member of a similar one in an EU country.
BG_197	9	He pointed out that a number of EU countries already have such committees, which include external experts, not only former finance ministers.
BG_197	10	"Asked whether it was possible to gather Ivan Kostov, Plamen Oresharski and Simeon Djankov in a joint commission, Djankov himself was adamant - ""Yes, it is possible""."
BG_197	11	"""Why shouldn't it be possible, these are people who have been involved in the processes of the state."
BG_197	12	"We know how to do financial and economic policy, we are no longer active"" , he clarified."
BG_197	13	The government is tired.
BG_197	14	"""This government is tired and the months until the elections are very important,"" Djankov added."
BG_197	15	He is adamant that urgent action is needed now.
BG_197	16	The financier pointed out that a number of countries in the EU have already held meetings with businesses and have identified measures for a potential third and fourth wave of the coronary crisis.
BG_197	17	So one can also study other people's experience and see what can be used from it.
BG_197	18	Taxes will go up in 2 years.
BG_197	19	Possible VAT increase.
BG_197	20	Now the cost of social benefits has gone up a lot.
BG_197	21	"We are heading towards a tax hike in 2 years"", Simeon Djankov further predicted."
BG_197	22	Asked whether a progressive tax will be introduced or the flat income tax will be raised from its current 10%, Djankov predicted a rise in VAT, from which much more revenue is currently collected in the budget.
BG_197	23	He was adamant that funds for business and social security was
BG_197	24	rather than just spending without buffers.
BG_197	25	Just a month ago, at the end of its mandate, the government signed a second major military deal for the acquisition of two new patrol ships for nearly 1 billion leva.
BG_197	26	This comes after the purchase of F-16 Block 70 fighter jets for over 2 billion leva from the US and Lockheed Martin.
BG_197	27	The third major project for the purchase of armoured vehicles for nearly 1.5 billion leva is moving more slowly and is very likely not to be signed within the government mandate.
BG_197	28	On the occasion of BNB Governor Dimitar Radev's forecast for a deterioration of banks' loan portfolios, Djankov pointed out that there are indeed risks.
BG_197	29	"""After increasing problems in business, after a year or two the problems of banks increase."
BG_197	30	"I think the banks are strong enough that we can avoid a banking crisis in a year or two,"" he said."
BG_197	31	On Friday, Dimitar Radev pointed out that the second wave of Covid-19 could realise the scenario of an exacerbation of the economic crisis, and hence a deterioration of banks' loan portfolios.
BG_197	32	He believes that banks should be prepared to operate in an environment of triggered capital buffers and a clear plan for their recovery after the crisis.
BG_197	33	The main effect on banks from the worsening of the crisis will be the rise in the share of bad loans, which according to the latest data is around 8%, but is well above the EU average.

BG_202	1	Six countries with electricity and fuel controls
BG_202	2	The first thing that the majority in the 47th National Assembly urgently dealt with was the prices of electricity, heating and water.
BG_202	3	And rightly so, because they are becoming increasingly unaffordable for many Bulgarian households.
BG_202	4	A moratorium on electricity, heating and water prices from December 16, 2021 to March 31, 2022 was imposed on Thursday after two days of debate and a re-vote on the terms.
BG_202	5	The Energy and Water Regulatory Commission, on the other hand, decided a day earlier to terminate the procedure for setting new prices for electricity and heat from 1 January 2022.
BG_202	6	Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, for his part, announced that from now on the price increase will only go after a full analysis of whether everything possible has been done to reduce the costs of energy production.
BG_202	7	"During the two-day discussions in the National Assembly about the moratorium, different interpretations were heard, for example, that with this decision we were sending messages to a ""banana republic""."
BG_202	8	But let's see what some countries in Europe have done.
BG_202	9	France, for example, has frozen gas prices until the end of 2022 and the next electricity price increase will be limited to 4%, thanks to a reduction in energy taxes.
BG_202	10	Italy has frozen gas prices for 2.5 million people and electricity prices for the poorest.
BG_202	11	In early October, the Belgian government extended fixed energy tariffs for lower-income households until March.
BG_202	12	At the end of October, the Croatian government capped the price of petrol and diesel for 30 days to mitigate the impact of the oil price surge on international markets.
BG_202	13	Romania has also taken serious measures against electricity and natural gas price rises by law and a price ceiling has been set.
BG_202	14	It applies for five months, from 1 November 2021 to 31 March 2022.
BG_202	15	The aim is to bring electricity and gas prices under control.
BG_202	16	The Romanian government has estimated that around 6 million households will benefit from these reductions.
BG_202	17	Spain, which is more dependent on gas for electricity generation than its European neighbours, decided in July to cut VAT on electricity.
BG_202	18	In September, the government temporarily cut another tax on electricity and placed limits on energy companies' profits.
BG_202	19	Greece is compensating people and small businesses for more expensive electricity.
BG_202	20	In our country there are already compensations for businesses because of the expensive electricity, but because of the constantly rising prices entrepreneurs demanded their increase.
BG_202	21	The EC itself encourages governments to take temporary measures against high prices.
BG_202	22	By the way, the moratorium is one of the topics on which Prime Minister Petkov spoke in Brussels at a meeting with EC President Ursula von der Leyen.
BG_202	23	We did not hear of any negative reaction or finger wagging, as we are being scared here by employers' organisations, EPCs and other traders interested in high electricity prices and their political lobbies.
BG_202	24	All European governments have taken or are taking their own measures - price freezes, subsidies, VAT cuts, etc., to protect their households from flying inflation.
BG_202	25	And inflation continues to set records.
BG_202	26	Experts had expected that inflation would reach 6% as late as the end of March 2022, but that much was already reported by the end of October on an annual basis.
BG_202	27	Just a few days ago, the NSI announced a 7.3% year-on-year increase in November - a record for the last decade.
BG_202	28	For the year in November, the biggest increase in services was in transport - 22%, which is explained by the fuel price hike.
BG_202	29	Household utilities - electricity, water, heating - went up by 10%, while food, which occupies the largest share in the consumer basket - by 7.2%.
BG_202	30	Energy prices for heating increased by 18.9%.
BG_202	31	Gaseous fuels for domestic use increased by 6.4% and coal by 23.3%.
BG_202	32	The increase in diesel fuel is 4.3% and in gasoline - 3%.
BG_202	33	In November, bread rose by 7.8%.
BG_202	34	Economists do not rule out inflation reaching 8% by the end of the year.
BG_202	35	However, this applies to the average level of all consumer prices, while the so-called small consumer basket has risen by much more - between 20 and 30%.
BG_202	36	This is the situation in the poorest country in the EU.
BG_202	37	Bulgaria is also the country with the most energy poor - nearly one-third of the population.
BG_202	38	The prospects for this market in the country and worldwide are clear.
BG_202	39	World agencies have been warning for months that the energy crisis is deepening and millions of households could be left out in the cold this winter.
BG_202	40	So, other EU countries should not be more stupid for bailing their people out of the crisis.
BG_202	41	Our Parliament voted a measure to support households.
BG_202	42	Fact.
BG_202	43	It is vital that people are supported to make it through the winter.
BG_202	44	This does not cancel out the special heating support for the poorest and most vulnerable households.
BG_202	45	Let the government and the experts analyse the energy sector while the moratorium lasts.
BG_202	46	And to bring the problems to light.
BG_202	47	According to the BSP deputy prof.
BG_202	48	Rumen Gechev, estimates are already being made and there are options to solve the price problem.
BG_213	1	Stefan Yanev announced his party.
BG_213	2	Bulgarian Rise 09:42
BG_213	3	Stefan Yanev announced his party and its main goals.
BG_213	4	He did this via Facebook.
BG_213	5	"The party will be called ""Bulgarian Rise""."
BG_213	6	Here are her intentions.
BG_213	7	The time has come to state a clear and firm position on the difficult situation our country finds itself in, both domestically and in view of the complex geopolitical situation.
BG_213	8	All of us should give this assessment, as citizens and Bulgarians, with a clear awareness of the historical responsibility we bear for the future of Bulgaria and the future generations.
BG_213	9	It is no secret that our country is in a deep crisis.
BG_213	10	A crisis that finds its manifestations in every sphere of social and economic life.
BG_213	11	We are facing a demographic catastrophe that is a major threat to our national security, threatening the very physical existence of the Bulgarian state.
BG_213	12	The economy is not functioning fully.
BG_213	13	There is no predictability regarding the rules.
BG_213	14	There are no appropriate conditions for the development and implementation of private initiative.
BG_213	15	Incomes continue to be humiliatingly low, and high inflation rates are devaluing them further.
BG_213	16	We are getting poorer and life is getting more expensive.
BG_213	17	The social system is about to collapse.
BG_213	18	Healthcare remains inaccessible for many Bulgarian citizens who are practically deprived of medical care.
BG_213	19	The education system is ineffective and functions chaotically, continuing to be completely inadequate to the demands of the economy and business.
BG_213	20	Corruption has taken deep roots in the country's political and economic system.
BG_213	21	The corrupt environment undermines our political system, the foundations of our democracy, making it dysfunctional and ineffective.
BG_213	22	Bulgaria has been in an almost permanent political crisis for years.
BG_213	23	The main institutions do not function according to the expectations of the Bulgarian citizens.
BG_213	24	Indicative in this respect is the systematically low trust enjoyed by the main organs of state power.
BG_213	25	There is a crisis in the representative functions of political parties.
BG_213	26	There is a very worrying trend of increasing political apathy.
BG_213	27	There is no meaningful political leadership.
BG_213	28	There is no authentic political elite.
BG_213	29	Our country needs a new perspective, a new model of political communication and interaction, a broad public consensus on key national priorities and goals.
BG_213	30	Faced with all these challenges, we can no longer stand idly by!
BG_213	31	It's time to wake up.
BG_213	32	It is time, as active citizens, to take responsibility for the fate of our own nation and state.
BG_213	33	"In this regard, I and a group of my supporters decided to start a new political formation, which we called ""BULGARIAN EXIT""!"
BG_213	34	"Why ""BULGARIAN""?!"
BG_213	35	Because Bulgaria is our homeland!
BG_213	36	Because our responsibility is to Bulgaria and to the future of Bulgarian children!
BG_213	37	Because Bulgaria is a country with thousands of years of history that has managed to preserve its name through the vicissitudes of time.
BG_213	38	It is our duty to continue to defend it in the future!
BG_213	39	"Why ""EXIT""?!"
BG_213	40	"Because it is high time to stop talking about ""stability"" and ""sustainability""!"
BG_213	41	Stability and resistance to what?!
BG_213	42	The misery?!
BG_213	43	On low incomes?!
BG_213	44	To our humiliated national dignity?!
BG_213	45	Of social decay?!
BG_213	46	The imitation of democracy?!
BG_213	47	It's time to talk about a new beginning!
BG_213	48	It is time to tell ourselves that the timelessness we live in, which has pinned us down, must end.
BG_213	49	And this can only happen when we stop thinking that the outrages of the compromised political elite are our fate, against which we are powerless.
BG_213	50	It's time to accept that we deserve nothing less than continuous forward development.
BG_213	51	It's time to accept that we deserve OUT!
BG_213	52	"Therefore, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Political Parties Act, we convene a meeting of the Initiative Committee of the PP ""Bulgarian Rising"" on 05.05.2022 at 10.30 in the conference hall of the ""Grand Hotel Sofia""."
BG_213	53	"It will adopt a founding declaration, which will set out the basic principles and objectives of our formation and will essentially represent the first action in the establishment of PP ""Bulgarian Rise"", preceding the holding of a constituent assembly, which will be convened within the statutory deadline."
BG_213	54	Our cause is for more justice, for true democracy, for sovereignty and national dignity!
BG_213	55	Our cause is Bulgaria!
BG_213	56	"We can only succeed together."""
BG_214	1	Atanas Atanasov crucified the coalition on the eve of
BG_214	2	Good Friday... 12:31
BG_214	3	The battle was to remove Borissov, now should we go back, asks Atanas Atanasov.
BG_214	4	I am sure the coalition will weather this storm as well.
BG_214	5	"This is how Atanas Atanasov, the MP from ""Democratic Bulgaria"", commented in the studio of ""Hello, Bulgaria"" on Nova the turmoil in the government because of the military aid to Ukraine."
BG_214	6	"""In this difficult time - war, inflation and so many problems for the country, Bulgarians do not want elections, but politicians to show courage."
BG_214	7	"I call on all of us who are part of this majority to show courage in this situation"", said Deputy Speaker."
BG_214	8	-Speaker.
BG_214	9	In Atanasov's words, Bulgaria can give arms to Ukraine without the government being overthrown.
BG_214	10	"""One thing is what will happen on the case in plenary, another is the fate of the government."
BG_214	11	"There is an overwhelming majority in the parliament to support the decision to give arms to Ukraine,"" the MP stressed."
BG_214	12	According to him, it is a question of civilisational choice.
BG_214	13	He specified that products of the Bulgarian military industry have long been on the territory of Ukraine.
BG_214	14	"""The question is on which side Bulgaria stands."
BG_214	15	"To pretend to be neutral at this time is to side with the aggressor,"" Atanasov clarified."
BG_214	16	The MEP clarified that our country's position is not neutral, but there are hesitations regarding one element.
BG_214	17	"""The Parliament, on the proposal of Democratic Bulgaria, adopted a declaration condemning the aggressor Russia in this war."
BG_214	18	"Bulgaria, in the person of its authorities, took a position and pointed out who is who"", he added."
BG_214	19	"""Bulgaria's military assistance is there."
BG_214	20	A position must be taken.
BG_214	21	We will be firm in this respect.
BG_214	22	"Without overthrowing the government, without leaving it, if our position does not get support, we have a way to dissociate ourselves from this and those who do not want to support giving military aid"", Atanasov is adamant."
BG_214	23	He is convinced that if a secret ballot is taken - there will be 200 votes for this decision.
BG_214	24	"On Tuesday, the national leadership of the DSB, the party of which Atanas Atanasov is the leader and which is one of the three formations in the coalition ""Democratic Bulgaria"", gathered."
BG_214	25	There they were going to discuss what are the options for action.
BG_214	26	"""In this dire situation the country is in, should we overthrow the government?"
BG_214	27	Should we do this?
BG_214	28	I am aware that I am bearing a heavy burden when I state this position, but we must act responsibly in this difficult national situation.
BG_214	29	"And I want to tell you that we may not be part of the coalition and this government to continue to exist, but let me not speculate more with different versions,"" the DB co-chair said."
BG_214	30	He explained that in this configuration of the parliament he did not see the possibility for another majority.
BG_214	31	Asked what is the likelihood they will leave the ruling coalition, but continue to support it, Atanasov said he had said enough and that there will be a discussion on the topic on Tuesday within the DSB.
BG_214	32	Such a decision, however, would probably also apply to Democratic Bulgaria as a whole, given that so far the three parties in it act in synchrony.
BG_214	33	"Recall that yesterday ""Yes, Bulgaria"" in the face of Hristo Ivanov hinted that they would leave power if military aid to Ukraine was not approved."
BG_214	34	Ivanov said he wanted a coalition council of the ruling party to be convened on Tuesday to discuss the case.
BG_214	35	The third party in the DB is the Green Movement.
BG_214	36	It has a deputy prime minister in the person of Borislav Sandov, who is also minister of environment and water.

BG_223	6	"Some time ago, when the changes were happening, my grandfather, a decent and infinitely honest man, used to say, ""Wow, children, you don't know what evil capitalism is."""
BG_223	7	Well, unfortunately, we already know.
BG_223	8	And so far there is no possibility for a big change, the rich will not just lose their power.
BG_223	9	But against the backdrop of ruthless exploitation, of monstrous division, the BSP is the party that fights for social gains, achieves them and defends them.
BG_223	10	The BSP is fighting for higher incomes for ordinary people amid galloping inflation and price speculation.
BG_223	11	Fight for benefits for young families, for an increase in pensions, for more money for education and culture.
BG_223	12	Fight to stop the trade in people's health.
BG_223	13	BSP is the national party.
BG_223	14	Which protects national interests.
BG_223	15	Even when these interests do not coincide with the interests of other major countries and European structures.
BG_223	16	BSP defends the traditional family and defends traditional Bulgarian moral values from the creeping poison of genderism that poisons humanity and threatens to kill it.
BG_223	17	"As tolerant as I am, I cannot help but resist the perversions that the ""democratic West"" is imposing quite undemocratically."
BG_223	18	There are two sexes, male and female, and one is born with them.
BG_223	19	There is a family where a man and a woman come together and the most precious thing they create is a child.
BG_223	20	Everything else is a sinister experiment designed to lead society to moral decay, and hence easier control.
BG_223	21	BSP is on the side of history.
BG_223	22	It protects memory, and without memory people are doomed.
BG_223	23	It confronts the resurgent wave of fascism in Europe and around the world, the destruction of monuments, hatred and oblivion.
BG_223	24	Because in the blood of the BSP speaks the blood of thousands of anti-fascists and communists who gave their lives selflessly in the name of a bright ideal.
BG_223	25	The BSP is the party of peace.
BG_223	26	The alternative to the coalition of war that is threatening to take over positions in our country.
BG_223	27	"An alternative to the mad and furious in their Russophobia parties, not only in Bulgaria, but in the whole of Europe, which support Ukraine in a war, practically prepared and started by the ""collective West"" in the name of American interests."
BG_223	28	Is that why the leaders of these parties are in consultations almost every day at the US embassy?
BG_223	29	Such a policy is leading humanity to destruction.
BG_223	30	Yes, BSP is not the comfortable party.
BG_223	31	It is the socialist party.
BG_223	32	And in spite of the currents in it, in spite of the clash of opinions, it has never given up socialism as a future prospect for society.
BG_223	33	That is why there are attempts to crush it, to destroy it.
BG_223	34	It has managed to preserve its identity and the living connection to its roots.
BG_223	35	There is no other in Europe.
BG_223	36	The larger European parties are social democratic, which means colluding with capital.
BG_223	37	Surely there are many more reasons to choose BSP and vote with number 1.
BG_223	38	But the most important reason is Edna - this is my party.
BG_225	1	The caretaker government is destabilising the country
BG_225	2	The Treasury report is dangerous, irresponsible and untrue.
BG_225	3	He received the strongest rebuttal from the BNB - a stable institution that has all the financial and economic information and a professional team.
BG_225	4	According to their data, the BNB's international foreign exchange reserves are at their highest level in 30 years.
BG_225	5	The fiscal reserve is BGN 16 billion, according to the MoF itself.
BG_225	6	"""In addition, Minister Velkova (then Deputy Minister of A."
BG_225	7	Vassilev), prepared the budget of the regular government for 2022 and the three-year forecast framework for 2023, 2024, 2025 to it.
BG_225	8	"And there is not a single word about the risk to financial stability with the set parameters for spending in 2022 and their impact in the next three years,"" BSP leader Kornelia Ninova wrote on Facebook about the intentions of the caretaker government to introduce new income restrictions and to increase taxes for businesses."
BG_225	9	"""The question logically follows, 'Why is the MoF turning 180 degrees right now?"
BG_225	10	Perhaps they want to cover up their own incompetence in revenue collection and rampant corruption and smuggling?
BG_225	11	But do they realise what an avalanche they can unleash with false claims and scaremongering?
BG_225	12	"We call on all responsible institutions to categorically refute the report of the Ministry of Finance and to stop any attempts to destabilise the country,"" Ninova further commented."
BG_225	13	There is no reason to change the existing exchange rate of the lev against the euro, and such statements are incompetent and irresponsible.
BG_225	14	This was officially stated by the Bulgarian National Bank.
BG_225	15	Apparently startled by the stormy public reaction, yesterday Minister Rositsa Velkova softened her forecasts for a future apocalypse.
BG_225	16	She told BNT that the country is not facing bankruptcy and there is no danger of a change in the fixed exchange rate of the lev against the euro.
BG_225	17	Veleva commented that the quotes from the report of the ministry were taken out of context.
BG_225	18	She assured that there was no need for the intervention of the MoF, nor for drawing new debt.
BG_225	19	A day earlier, she claimed that there was such a possibility.
BG_225	20	The scenarios for a possible bankruptcy were outlined in a report of the Ministry of Finance to the Council of Ministers, which had no intention of becoming public.
BG_225	21	On Wednesday, however, his conclusions became public and hours later Velkova announced that the budget deficit must be sharply reduced, because otherwise there is a danger on the international capital markets not to raise the necessary amount of debt, which is why it will have to seek financing from the International Monetary Fund.
BG_225	22	"The economist Kuzman Iliev also described as a ""mini financial Armageddon for Bulgaria"" the forecasts that there is a risk for the currency board and a loan from the IMF may be needed."
BG_225	23	"In his words, ""a loan from the IMF is a stigma that means investors forget about Bulgaria and we will finance ourselves very expensively""."
BG_225	24	According to him, it is unrealistic the deficit to become 3% by the end of the year and the fall of the flat tax will become a fashionable topic very soon.
BG_225	25	BIA: The Cabinet's measures are wrong.
BG_225	26	"""The measures envisaged by the caretaker government for a way out of the situation are wrong,"" Assoc."
BG_225	27	Shteryo Nozarov, economic advisor at the Bulgarian Industrial Association.
BG_225	28	On the proposal to introduce a one-time solidarity contribution for the second half of this year or the so-called excess profit tax for all legal entities, Nojarov pointed out that excess profit and punishing active companies that have a positive financial result is only discussed in the planned economy.
BG_225	29	"""What does 'solidarity contribution' mean?"
BG_225	30	In solidarity with what?
BG_225	31	By the government not implementing public investment and public capital expenditure, which creates obstacles for business?
BG_225	32	Or that the population in the last ten years has decreased by one million people, but the government even increases the size of the civil service.
BG_225	33	And all this raises the budget costs.
BG_225	34	"Is this the solidarity we are talking about?"""
BG_225	35	, the economist asked.
BG_225	36	According to him, the reinstatement of some of the VAT and excise duty rates will lead to a risk of inflation recovery.
BG_225	37	The toll increase will seriously affect Bulgarian carriers.
BG_225	38	Their competitiveness will be reduced as they have a lower budget than their EU and neighbouring counterparts operating or passing through Bulgarian territory.
BG_225	39	"""The final bill will again be paid by the passengers and users of these services and will lead to an increase in inflation,"" Nozarov said."
BG_M_004	1	Together we will build a strong country by ensuring our internal security and investing in our own defence capabilities.
BG_M_004	2	We will ensure the continuous development and improvement of the internal security and public order system and policy in line with the expectations of civil society, the dynamics of societal processes, international arrangements and global technological developments.
BG_M_004	3	We will work to shape a national culture of homeland security and public order as a set of shared values, goals, behaviours and practices.
BG_M_004	4	We will develop a policy to increase the contribution of the homeland security and public order sector to the implementation and effectiveness of other national policies.
BG_M_004	5	The main objective of the policy on internal security and public order is to achieve an acceptable level of risks to society, mainly through increased control of conventional crime, reduction of organised crime, reduction of road traffic accidents, fires, disasters and catastrophes, fraud, illegal trafficking and other actual risks and their consequences, in order to sufficiently protect the rights, freedoms and security of the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria, business and society as a whole.

BG_M_031	1	GROWTH THROUGH INNOVATION
BG_M_031	2	The development of innovation will lead to the modernization of the economy, reform and modernization of the administration.

BG_M_031	6	The main problems in the sector are the weak institutions, creating an unpredictable and high-risk business environment, hindering the creation of innovations and the development of businesses related to them, the lack of interaction between research, modern innovation and business, the shortage of highly qualified and specialized personnel.

DE_005	1	From ministerial post to car association
DE_005	2	According to Bild am Sonntag, former SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel is the favorite to become head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA).
DE_005	3	"""Gabriel is 99 percent sure,"" the newspaper quotes an unnamed industry manager."
DE_005	4	The former Vice-Chancellor is the preferred candidate of the car companies and suppliers.
DE_005	5	Former CDU politician Hildegard Müller is said to be in the running alongside Gabriel, as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported at the weekend.
DE_005	6	According to Bild am Sonntag, however, she only has an outside chance.
DE_005	7	According to the report, details are to be clarified with Gabriel in the coming week.
DE_005	8	"""If there are no irreconcilable differences with Gabriel, he will be the new president."""
DE_005	9	The post of top lobbyist for the automotive industry needs to be filled after Bernhard Mattes announced his retirement at the end of 2019 in September.
DE_005	10	The former Ford manager has only been VDA President since March 2018; his term of office was originally not due to end for another year.
DE_005	11	The VDA is one of the most influential lobbying associations in Germany, and the automotive sector is a key industry with more than 800,000 direct employees.
DE_005	12	The association is considered difficult to manage because it has to reconcile the various interests of manufacturers and suppliers.
DE_005	13	He is also said to be very close to politics.
DE_005	14	The car industry has recently come under heavy pressure due to the diesel scandal.
DE_005	15	Another major topic is the climate debate and the planned conversion of car traffic towards e-mobility.
DE_005	16	"According to Bild am Sonntag, the industry is hoping that Gabriel will ""once again have a greater political and social voice"" in view of these problems."
DE_005	17	Gabriel was most recently Foreign Minister until March 2018, before that he was Head of the Economics Department in Berlin - and as Minister President of the car state of Lower Saxony, he also had a seat on the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen.
DE_005	18	Gabriel is currently still a member of the Bundestag for the Salzgitter-Wolfenbüttel constituency, but will resign his seat in the Bundestag on January 1.
DE_005	19	November, as he had announced at the end of September.
DE_005	20	"In a letter to friends and companions, he explained this step with ""very personal reasons""."
DE_005	21	"Gabriel does not have to expect any legal problems if he moves into the private sector: The Federal Ministerial Act only stipulates that members of the Federal Government must report any gainful employment or other employment outside the public sector ""within the first 18 months of leaving office""."
DE_005	22	"However, the SPD politician himself distanced himself from working as a lobbyist shortly after leaving his ministerial post: ""You shouldn't knock on doors that you yourself have sat behind,"" he said at the time."
DE_005	23	The SPD merely said at the weekend that it did not wish to comment on speculation.
DE_005	24	"Critical voices came from the Left Party in the Bundestag: ""If an ex-economics minister is to become chief car lobbyist 2.5 years later, that smacks of a bad thing,"" wrote Left Party parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch on Twitter."
DE_005	25	"""I find that indecent."
DE_005	26	"Turning a blind eye to the diesel scandal and slowing down e-mobility now appear in a different light."""
DE_005	27	Gabriel would not be the first high-ranking former politician to switch to business after his political career.
DE_005	28	Shortly after leaving the chancellorship in 2005, his party comrade Gerhard Schröder took over the chairmanship of the supervisory board of the Nord Stream Baltic Sea pipeline, which is dominated by the Russian company Gazprom.
DE_005	29	Schröder had campaigned for the project as head of government.
DE_005	30	Hildegard Müller (CDU), who is being discussed as Gabriel's rival for the VDA post, was previously Minister of the Chancellery and a confidante of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
DE_005	31	Müller moved to the Federal Association of the Energy and Water Industries as Managing Director in October 2008.
DE_005	32	Former VDA President Matthias Wissmann (CDU) was also politically active before his work as a lobbyist, most recently as Federal Minister of Transport.
DE_026	1	Problems with vaccine deliveries in the EU: maybe something Russian after all?
DE_026	2	In the dispute over the slow supply of vaccines, the European Union has clashed with the World Health Organization (WHO).
DE_026	3	At the same time, the EU is reaching out to Russia and China in the hope of being able to procure vaccines there in an emergency.
DE_026	4	Meanwhile, the wrangling over the contracts with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical group Astrazeneca and other manufacturers continues.
DE_026	5	Astrazeneca had announced that it would supply significantly fewer vaccines than agreed.
DE_026	6	"As a result, the EU Commission introduced a new ""transparency mechanism"" at the weekend with which it intends to monitor and, if necessary, block vaccine exports."
DE_026	7	"Behind this is the concern that Astrazeneca could ""divert"" vaccine from factories in the EU to the UK."
DE_026	8	This is to prevent the export brake.
DE_026	9	But before it even takes effect, there is already a new dispute.
DE_026	10	"The WHO sharply criticized the EU measure and warned against European ""health nationalism""."
DE_026	11	"The imposition of export restrictions is a ""worrying trend"", said Mariangela Simao, who is responsible for medicines and vaccines at the WHO."
DE_026	12	The vaccines must be distributed fairly worldwide, demanded WHO boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
DE_026	13	"""Vaccine nationalism may serve short-term political goals."
DE_026	14	"But that is short-sighted and will backfire."" The pandemic must be fought everywhere at the same time."
DE_026	15	"""If a village is on fire, it makes no sense for a small group to hoard all the fire extinguishers to protect their own homes."" When asked by taz, the chief spokesperson for Commission President Ursula von der Leyen explained that the EU remains fully committed to the WHO and its objectives."
DE_026	16	"The criticism from Geneva has been ""noted"", the spokesperson continued."
DE_026	17	"The controversial export brake is not about bans, but about a ""transparent and balanced"" supply of vaccines."
DE_026	18	Critics, on the other hand, speak of a dangerous precedent that could trigger a new wave of protectionism.
DE_026	19	"""Export restrictions can have political and economic consequences,"" warns the head of the Trade Committee in the European Parliament, Bernd Lange."
DE_026	20	"The measure could ""backfire if other countries also introduce it""."
DE_026	21	Until now, the EU has always preached free trade and condemned export restrictions.
DE_026	22	However, in light of the coronavirus crisis, it seems to be forgetting these market-liberal principles.
DE_026	23	There are also signs of a turnaround in dealings with Russia and China.
DE_026	24	The coronavirus vaccines developed there have so far not been worth mentioning to the EU.
DE_026	25	However, on Monday the Commission admitted that talks were taking place with the Russian manufacturer.
DE_026	26	The German government is also open to importing vaccines from Russia.
DE_026	27	However, approval must first be granted by the European Medicines Agency, according to Berlin.
DE_026	28	One reason for the delay also seems to be that the EU negotiated its contracts with manufacturers later - but then also more thoroughly.
DE_026	29	For example, the USA has guaranteed pharmaceutical companies immunity by regulation should one of the vaccines against Covid-19 have side effects that lead to lawsuits.
DE_026	30	Accordingly, it is simply not possible to sue Moderna, Biontech or Pfizer, Astrazeneca or other companies in the USA if vaccination damage occurs.
DE_026	31	Unless they would deliberately sabotage their own vaccines.
DE_026	32	Two contracts are now public in the EU, the one with the Tübingen-based manufacturer CureVac and the one with the British-Swedish manufacturer Astrazeneca.
DE_026	33	These also contain generous clauses according to which EU member states assume the costs if the companies or their suppliers are sued due to vaccination damage.
DE_026	34	However, their protection is significantly weaker than in the USA: it is a contract, not a regulation.
DE_026	35	Lawsuits against corporations are possible, otherwise national laws would have had to be changed.
DE_026	36	And the cost assumptions include exceptions.
DE_026	37	But these of all things are blacked out in the contracts.
DE_026	38	What exactly the companies would have to pay for in case of doubt: still unknown.
DE_026	39	Berlin and Brussels say that the contracts with the other manufacturers contain less generous guarantees against damage claims.
DE_026	40	This cannot be verified: at the end of January, the EU Parliament once again called for uncensored access to the contracts.
DE_031	1	Corona pandemic: Major Düsseldorf concert postponed until late fall
DE_031	2	It was foreseeable: The planned large-scale concert with up to 13,000 guests in the Düsseldorf soccer stadium will not take place on September 4.
DE_031	3	Even before an official decision was made by the state government, the organizers pulled the ripcord.
DE_031	4	The major concert in Düsseldorf originally planned for September 4 with up to 13,000 spectators is to be postponed until late fall.
DE_031	5	This was announced by the organizer on Wednesday.
DE_031	6	NRW Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) welcomed the decision.
DE_031	7	"""Despite a convincing hygiene and protection concept"", the organizers had felt compelled to take this step in view of rising infection figures and subsequent capacity restrictions, according to a statement."
DE_031	8	The more than 7,000 visitors who had already purchased tickets will now be refunded their entrance fees, including advance booking fees.
DE_031	9	"Just over two weeks ago, the state, the city and the organizer Marek Lieberberg announced in a joint statement that the concert in the ""Merkur Spiel-Arena"" soccer stadium would be postponed depending on the current infection situation - and that it would take place on 31 December at the latest."
DE_031	10	August to decide whether it will take place.
DE_031	11	"""It had become clear that the state government had reservations about this,"" Lieberberg's company Live Nation announced on Wednesday: ""The opposing positions could not be bridged."""
DE_031	12	"Lieberberg added: ""We are still of the opinion that our catalog of measures offers fans, artists and employees comprehensive protection."""
DE_031	13	However, the current atmosphere is preventing a consensus.
DE_031	14	"That is why the project is now to be ""realized at a later date""."
DE_031	15	The organizers did not give a specific date in late autumn.
DE_031	16	"Lieberberg expressed his gratitude to the city of Düsseldorf and its event subsidiary D.Live, ""who gave live music a fair chance and approved the event on the basis of plausible facts"", according to Live Nation."
DE_031	17	Lieberberg paid particular tribute to the willingness of Bryan Adams, Sarah Connor, Rea Garvey, The BossHoss, Joris and Michael Mittermeier to perform in Düsseldorf.
DE_031	18	"The concert under the motto ""Give Live a Chance"" was held on 7."
DE_031	19	August was announced.
DE_031	20	The city of Düsseldorf had already approved it at this point.
DE_031	21	The state government only officially found out about the project that day.
DE_031	22	NRW Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) immediately expressed doubts about the legal basis of the concert.
DE_031	23	In the past few days, Laumann had said several times that a soccer match with thousands of spectators could not be banned, but that a concert of this size could be allowed.
DE_031	24	"After announcing the provisional cancellation of the concert, Laumann said again on Wednesday: ""In view of the current infection situation, I am of the opinion that a concert of this magnitude is currently not feasible."""
DE_031	25	"There have also been ""very constructive discussions with all parties involved"" in recent days."
DE_031	26	"Laumann thanked those responsible ""for making this very rational and comprehensible decision""."
DE_040	1	Africa aid conference in Paris: lots of money, no patents
DE_040	2	International donors want to use billions in aid to boost Africa's economy after the coronavirus pandemic.
DE_040	3	Around 100 billion US dollars (around 82.3 billion euros) could be mobilized via the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, also thanks to the solidarity of rich countries.
DE_040	4	This was announced by French head of state Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday in Paris after an Africa aid conference.
DE_040	5	They are also calling for the revocation of patents on vaccines against Covid-19 to enable the production of vaccines in Africa.
DE_040	6	The main topic of the summit was the promotion of the economies in Africa, which are being hit hard directly and indirectly by the consequences of the Covid pandemic.
DE_040	7	In many countries, this has led to a decline in exports and income from tourism.
DE_040	8	Macron had invited people to the meeting to find financial and political solutions together.
DE_040	9	"However, it was already foreseeable that he would not be able to convince his European partners and the USA of his somewhat ambitious goal of a ""New Deal for Africa""."
DE_040	10	Nothing in the final communiqué corresponds to this ambition.
DE_040	11	In Paris, no additional debt relief was decided or new financial commitments made, although the figures for the financial emergency caused by the pandemic were available.
DE_040	12	According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), African countries will need around 285 billion US dollars by 2025 to counter the economic impact of the pandemic.
DE_040	13	The continent recorded a recession for the first time in 25 years.
DE_040	14	At least 30 million people in Africa fell into extreme poverty in 2020.
DE_040	15	Equitable access to vaccines.
DE_040	16	The IMF will initially release 33 billion of the 650 billion US dollars in special drawing rights (SDRs) for African countries, as already planned.
DE_040	17	To lend weight to his demands, Macron has announced that France will contribute its quota of SDR to this pot of aid, and if others follow his example, 100 billion could easily be raised.
DE_040	18	Decisions on this could be taken at the next G7 or G20 meeting.
DE_040	19	"In the final declaration, the summit participants agree on one point: ""The absolute priority is first to defeat the pandemic."" Above all, access to vaccines must be regulated more fairly."
DE_040	20	So far, the African continent has only received one percent of the vaccines worldwide.
DE_040	21	The licenses are to be suspended so that they can be produced directly in the countries where they are urgently needed.
DE_040	22	Macron emphasized that they want to remove all restrictions on intellectual property that block the production of any kind of vaccine in Africa.
DE_040	23	Such a repeal of patents, which was first demanded by India and South Africa, is also supported by US President Joe Biden.
DE_040	24	"Macron's goal is to ""create production capacities for the existing vaccines in Africa in the coming weeks through financial and industrial partnerships""."
DE_056	1	Almost drowned in the river US soldier rescues child from Rio Grande
DE_056	2	A little girl had a great guardian angel: a 10-year-old migrant from El Salvador was in danger of drowning in the Rio Grande after a smuggler left her in the river while trying to reach the USA.
DE_056	3	But a US soldier saved her life.
DE_056	4	The incident is already the third in just one week.
DE_056	5	The girl had been abandoned by a people smuggler, wrote the Daily Mail.
DE_056	6	The U.S. newspaper reported that U.S. Customs said several people were making the illegal crossing from Mexico to the United States when the trooper spotted the child Tuesday night.
DE_056	7	The group and the smuggler fled back to Mexico and left the girl behind.
DE_056	8	The child then fought for survival in the raging river.
DE_056	9	The little girl was only able to keep her head above water with difficulty.
DE_056	10	The soldier had not hesitated for long and had jumped into the water.
DE_056	11	He managed to rescue the girl from the floods and bring her safely to shore.
DE_056	12	The Rio Grande rises in the Rocky Mountains in the US state of Colorado and then flows towards Mexico.
DE_056	13	It also forms part of the border between the USA and Mexico.
DE_056	14	It is crossed by migrants and smugglers trying to reach the USA.
DE_056	15	The US Army soldier who rescued the girl is stationed in the border region of the US state of Texas and supports the US customs authority with his unit.
DE_056	16	Being a father himself, it was especially frustrating for him to see a young child left to fend for himself by smugglers in the rushing currents of the Rio Grande, said the patrol agent in charge, Matthew J.
DE_056	17	Hudak told the Daily Mail.
DE_056	18	The girl is the third unaccompanied minor to be rescued by US authorities in the Rio Grande in less than a week.
DE_056	19	All three minors had been abandoned by people smugglers.
DE_056	20	Earlier, Border Patrol agents reportedly found two abandoned boys, ages 7 and 13, from Honduras on a small island in the middle of the Rio Grande.
DE_056	21	The boys told the officers that they were traveling with a man who promised to take them across the border between the United States and Mexico.
DE_056	22	But then he disappeared.
DE_056	23	The girl from El Salvador reportedly did not need any medical help.
DE_056	24	She is now in the care of the US Department of Health and Human Services.
DE_056	25	According to the US Customs Service, cases of US soldiers having to save the lives of migrants in the Rio Grande are increasing this year, the Daily Mail reports.
DE_056	26	The US government has noticed an alarming increase in unaccompanied children crossing the southwestern US border illegally.
DE_056	27	The US Department of Homeland Security has data showing that Border Patrol agents stopped around 9,000 unaccompanied migrant minors in February for illegally entering the US from Mexico.
DE_056	28	The number of migrant children arriving at the border alone had risen significantly to more than 18,000 in March.
DE_064	1	"After manifesto from Green Party ranks: Lindner calls for steps against ""irregular migration"""
DE_064	2	"""Irregular migration"" is not sufficiently prevented in Germany, says Finance Minister Christian Lindner ."
DE_064	3	The FDP leader is now calling for more consistent deportation of migrants without the right of residence.
DE_064	4	"Otherwise, it would lead to ""permanent residence and receipt of social benefits"", Lindner told the news portal t-online on Wednesday (22."
DE_064	5	February).
DE_064	6	"In return, it is about ""paving the way for immigrants who want to work here by, among other things, recognizing existing qualifications more quickly,"" Lindner demanded."
DE_064	7	FDP politician Joachim Stamp is the new Federal Government Commissioner for Migration.
DE_064	8	"In Lindner's opinion, Stamp should ""conclude agreements with countries of origin on the repatriation of illegal immigrants"", suggested Lindner."
DE_064	9	A give and take is conceivable.
DE_064	10	"""Easier visas for students and economic cooperation, but also partnership in the prevention of illegal migration."" Migration policy in Germany: Palmer also warns in Green ""memorandum"" The Realo group ""Vert Realos"" fundamentally questioned the Greens' migration policy course in a memorandum this week."
DE_064	11	The party leadership initially left the appeal largely uncommented.
DE_064	12	For the Greens, this area is about humanity and order, said party leader Omid Nouripour on Monday (20.
DE_064	13	February).
DE_064	14	"""There are all kinds of contributions to the debate, which we naturally not only take note of, but also work on."" The manifesto states that a shift to the right is also to be feared in Germany if citizens continue to lose their sense of security."
DE_064	15	The signatories include Tübingen's mayor Boris Palmer, former Green parliamentary group leader Rezzo Schlauch and former MEP Rebecca Harms.
DE_064	16	There is hardly any distinction between war, asylum and economic migrants, the report continued.
DE_064	17	Traffic light coalition: The Scholz cabinet at a glance Current figures on migration: Number of asylum applications in Germany is rising.
DE_064	18	Germany registered 244,132 asylum applications last year, an increase of almost 28 percent compared to 2021.
DE_064	19	Most of the applicants also came from Syria and Afghanistan.
DE_064	20	States and municipalities complain about the .
DE_064	21	However, a refugee summit convened by Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) in Berlin just under a week ago did not bring any new concrete financial commitments from the federal government.
DE_064	22	At the special EU summit on immigration in February, the participants agreed on accelerated deportations and the expansion of fortifications at the external borders.
DE_064	23	"Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) then spoke of a ""pragmatic"" solution."
DE_064	24	Immigration in the EU: multiple asylum applications?
DE_064	25	However, the Asylum Agency and the EU Commission assume that the EU-wide asylum applications will not be matched by the same number of applicants.
DE_064	26	They suspect that many migrants submit applications in several EU countries in order to increase their chances.
DE_064	27	This is also indicated by figures from the EU border protection agency Frontex: last year, it counted around 330,000 irregular arrivals in the EU, but the number of asylum applications is almost three times as high.
DE_064	28	"A citizens' initiative is lobbying the EU Commission for a ""dignified reception of migrants in Europe""."
DE_064	29	The organizers now have six months to collect one million signatures from at least seven different member states.
DE_064	30	They can then call on the Commission to act - but this is not binding.
DE_064	31	The initiative also calls for a functioning distribution system for immigrants in Europe.
DE_064	32	A voluntary initiative involving Germany and France recently came to nothing.
DE_068	1	"""Strengthen freedom of choice"": FDP politician: Need legal framework for mobile working"
DE_068	2	"As a consequence of the coronavirus crisis, the FDP is calling on the German government to finally create a modern legal framework ""for genuine, location-independent and mobile working""."
DE_068	3	"FDP labor market politician Johannes Vogel told the German Press Agency: ""Anyone who wants to take mobile working seriously will strengthen people's freedom of choice between working in the office, at their desk at home, on the couch or in a café."
DE_068	4	"And it gives companies the legal certainty to be able to do just that without monstrous bureaucracy."""
DE_068	5	"This would ""necessarily include a modernization of the Working Hours Act""."
DE_068	6	Digitalization offers more and more people the opportunity to decide for themselves where and when they want to work.
DE_068	7	"""But if you want to read a business e-mail at 10 or 11 p.m. today, you must not return to work before 10 a.m. the next day."
DE_068	8	"That is out of touch with reality, hardly anyone adheres to it anymore."""
DE_068	9	Germany should be guided here by the EU directive on working time.
DE_068	10	This prescribes the same weekly working hours and break times as German law, but allows a more flexible schedule during the week.
DE_068	11	The CDU/CSU and SPD were accused by the FDP parliamentary group's labor market spokesman of talking past each other on this point.
DE_068	12	Economics Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) and the CDU/CSU would prefer not to change anything at all.
DE_068	13	"Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) and the SPD ""are forging ahead and announcing a law, but so far there is only a headline""."
DE_068	14	It is to be feared that the SPD simply wants to continue old rules from the analog world into the digital age or create one-sided legal claims.
DE_068	15	However, the coronavirus pandemic shows that mobile working is possible in many places and in many professions - even where there was previously skepticism.
DE_068	16	"""This offers us great opportunities even after the crisis: less traffic, a very short commute to work, more flexibility in terms of where you work and therefore more self-determination for everyone."""
DE_068	17	"But it is also clear: ""Not everyone can and wants to work from home all the time."""
DE_068	18	Vogel referred to the experience of the neighboring Netherlands.
DE_068	19	They have been showing us how it's done for five years now: in one package, the Working Hours Act was modernized, home office and working in a café were made equally possible and a right to discussion was introduced for employees.
DE_068	20	Mobile working is no longer particularly necessary to justify, but rather to reject.
DE_073	1	30 percent less emissions by 2030: EU agrees on climate protection targets for trucks and buses
DE_073	2	Following in the footsteps of car manufacturers, the EU is now also setting CO2 targets for truck and bus manufacturers.
DE_073	3	However, the conditions are not as strict as the European Parliament had hoped.
DE_073	4	For the first time, the EU is imposing strict climate protection requirements on truck and bus manufacturers.
DE_073	5	Negotiators from the member states and the European Parliament agreed on Tuesday night that the average carbon dioxide emissions of new vehicles must be 30 percent lower from 2030 than in 2019.
DE_073	6	An interim target of 15 percent is to be introduced for 2025.
DE_073	7	At the same time, there are plans to create new incentives for the use of zero-emission and low-emission vehicles, as the EU Commission confirmed on Tuesday morning.
DE_073	8	Details of the provisional agreement were not initially disclosed.
DE_073	9	According to a spokesperson for the Council of Member States, they should be published in the course of the day.
DE_073	10	The vehicle manufacturers had tried to prevent the new regulations until the very end.
DE_073	11	Among other things, they argue that alternative drive systems such as electric motors are difficult to implement in long-distance transportation.
DE_073	12	The EU member states and the European Parliament had already agreed on new climate targets for cars last December.
DE_073	13	Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars are set to fall by 37.5 percent by 2030 compared to 2021.
DE_073	14	The fact that the new requirements for truck and bus manufacturers are less strict than those for cars is due to the fact that buyers of trucks and buses generally pay much more attention to low fuel consumption than those of cars in order to maximize profits.
DE_073	15	This in turn means that commercial vehicle manufacturers tend to produce vehicles with optimized fuel consumption and therefore do not have quite as much savings potential.
DE_073	16	Nevertheless, the EU Parliament had actually called for more ambitious targets for heavy commercial vehicles as well.
DE_073	17	It wanted a 35 percent reduction in CO2 levels by 2030 and an interim target of 20 percent by 2025.
DE_073	18	Bas Eickhout, the Dutch Green politician and responsible rapporteur of the European Parliament, criticized the member states on Tuesday.
DE_073	19	"""Germany, Italy and some central European countries in particular have blocked stronger climate targets,"" he said."
DE_073	20	In the long term, this would not only harm the climate, but also European industry.
DE_073	21	Nevertheless, Eickhout described the agreement as a great success.
DE_073	22	The regulation will help to reduce pollution on the roads and improve air quality, he commented.
DE_073	23	The responsible EU Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete also welcomed the agreement.
DE_073	24	This completes the legal framework that should enable the EU climate protection targets to be achieved, he said.
DE_073	25	They envisage a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.
DE_103	1	Nightmares in neo-noir
DE_103	2	"""It's hard to be so precise about something so crazy."""
DE_103	3	The script that director Alice (Ayelet Zurer) has in her hands is quite something.
DE_103	4	The scenes described in it are obviously explicitly overwhelming and threatening.
DE_103	5	Alice had ignored the script in her email inbox for two weeks, until on the train home - was it really a coincidence?
DE_103	6	- got to know the author.
DE_103	7	The young Sophie (Lihi Koronowski) has outed herself as an admirer of her work and was allegedly even on one of Alice's earlier writing courses.
DE_103	8	Now Room 209, as the title suggests, is to be made into a movie.
DE_103	9	Once home, she tells her husband David (Gal Toren), a popular actor, about the strange encounter with the stranger on the train.
DE_103	10	He knows the book because he is already engaged as the male lead.
DE_103	11	"""Pretty perverse,"" he says."
DE_103	12	It is the story of a young woman who begins an S&M relationship with the father of her best friend - with fatal consequences.
DE_103	13	Alice finishes reading Room 209 the same night.
DE_103	14	Can you make something like that up?
DE_103	15	Alice is in her late forties, has three daughters and a beautiful house on the outskirts of the city.
DE_103	16	A normal, well-off family life, you might think - but why is the mother-in-law constantly visiting and making unsubtle claims of ownership over her son?
DE_103	17	At one point, she wears her daughter-in-law's silk nightgown.
DE_103	18	Alice goes through a creative crisis, shoots television commercials, can no longer write.
DE_103	19	She knows that Room 209 would save her as a director.
DE_103	20	What she doesn't know is that Sophie has long since chosen her.
DE_103	21	Because the young author is suddenly always there, appears at the children's birthday party and paints Alice's little daughter deep red lips.
DE_103	22	She secretly meets the actress who is to play the lead role on the eve of the audition, whereupon she bursts into tears during the audition.
DE_103	23	Positions herself for the role and - like the young woman in her own book - has an older boyfriend.
DE_103	24	And like Room 209, Losing Alice is about desire right from the start.
DE_103	25	About obsession.
DE_103	26	It's about playing with the power you have over other people.
DE_103	27	Perhaps also about the girlfriend, when she no longer knows how to help herself and - as can be seen in the first few minutes of this series, which is disturbing from the start - seeks redemption in a hotel room.
DE_103	28	Losing Alice is one of the most unusual TV series these days and comes - once again - from Israel.
DE_103	29	Released last summer in Israel and now internationally by Apple TV+, the eight-part thriller is unlike most series productions in that it comes from a single source - and is therefore more reminiscent of classic auteur cinema.
DE_103	30	Sigal Avin, who was born in Florida and emigrated to Israel with her parents at the age of ten, has created a scenario as screenwriter and director in which psycho-horror, neo-noir nightmares and social studies merge into one another.
DE_103	31	It is her own world that becomes a threat to Alice, her own constraints and unfulfilled desires.
DE_103	32	Much of it seems familiar, or at least as familiar as the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma and David Lynch, some of which are even quoted directly.
DE_103	33	But you don't need to be familiar with the numerous allusions to soon feel rather uncomfortable on the false ground on which you are being led: Is this a fiction of an unusual TV series feigned as reality, as usual?
DE_103	34	Are the flashbacks and flashforwards that repeatedly take us by surprise fragments of Alice's past or eerie visions of the future?
DE_103	35	Or is it already footage from Room 209, as Alice imagines this movie to be?
DE_103	36	Sigal Avin's astonishing skill also lies in the way she allows her heroine to walk open-eyed into her doom: Although every suspicion that arises in Alice is subsequently proven to be true, her resistance to the intruder grows weaker from episode to episode.
DE_103	37	Her and David's hallucinations and fantasies intertwine like an endlessly woven ribbon with the story of Sophie, a femme fatale with a pageboy head who sets one trap after another for them.
DE_103	38	At least that's what they think.
DE_103	39	Until you realize that you have landed in one yourself while watching.
DE_104	1	Cosmetics are the beginning of all boosters
DE_104	2	"This choice is the best choice of an ""Anglicism of the Year""."
DE_104	3	This decision makes it easy to forget how unsatisfactory the outdated word choices of all kinds have long been.
DE_104	4	In their efforts to be correct, they stand in the way of anything that could lead to some kind of insight through originality or exposure.
DE_104	5	Because criticism suffices in pointing to something that is either very right or very wrong.
DE_104	6	"This is no different with ""boosters""."
DE_104	7	Nevertheless!
DE_104	8	Unlike the noun, which is clearly borrowed from English, the verb is probably a German creation of its own, according to the press release issued by the jury headed by linguist Anatol Stefanowitsch.
DE_104	9	"The noun booster shot stands for ""booster vaccination"", and that really doesn't sound catchy."
DE_104	10	"The corresponding verb is actually ""to boost"", but since the beginning of January ""to booster"" has been used more frequently in English."
DE_104	11	"What a booster for the self-confidence of the ""German language community"", because they ""recognized the potential of English well before the English language community and used it for themselves""."
DE_104	12	Too woke to be clear.
DE_104	13	For yourself?
DE_104	14	More for an idea.
DE_104	15	"A look at the finalists reveals this: ""Long Covid"", ""QR code"", ""cringe"", ""woke""."
DE_104	16	All somehow just the green around the flower.
DE_104	17	"""Boosting"" is exclusively for the good and sounds only half as infantile as ""spades"" and nowhere near as pretentious as ""pimping"" or - you're already looking at a smart person with a smart hairstyle: ""spicing up""."
DE_104	18	The Digital Dictionary of the German Language would boost when it comes to stimulating, reinforcing, magnifying, just for example an immune reaction.
DE_104	19	Cosmetics were the beginning of all boosters.
DE_104	20	Lips and eyelashes can be boosted for a long time.
DE_104	21	"Products such as ""Natucollagen Boost Volume Lip Serum"" and ""Mascara med Ultra Boost"" boost business and well-being in general, as long as this is fed by the kind of plumping and puffing that invigorates all linguistic fashions."
DE_104	22	Language criticism as a campaign booster.
DE_104	23	The message can be even more important than the text, the resonance even more important than the sound.
DE_104	24	"In contrast to the word ""booster vaccination"", the jury said that ""booster"" enables ""concise yet clear communication"" in the ""ongoing pandemic""."
DE_104	25	Because things have to move quickly if the laboratories can no longer keep up, not to mention the federal and state governments.
DE_104	26	"Secondly, the emphasis is - attention, message: ""on the transience of vaccination protection - we are only boosted as long as the protective effect of the booster vaccination is still sufficiently high."""
DE_104	27	Language criticism as a campaign booster.
DE_104	28	Thirdly, such a beautiful word is a mirror to itself.
DE_104	29	"It has ""an optimistic and dynamic connotation"", the reasoning goes, ""which the refresh simply cannot match""."
DE_104	30	It would not be fair to accuse the jury of voluntary satire at this point.
DE_104	31	Because the fun naturally stops when it comes to vaccination, which leads to interesting effects.
DE_104	32	Since what must not be said cannot be funny, the comic is concentrated in the overtones of what is said.
DE_104	33	Or as they say today: the joke boosts the joke.
DE_110	1	"Culture ""Dangerous"" art: Rosemarie Trockel in Frankfurt"
DE_110	2	The entrance hall of Frankfurt's Museum of Modern Art features a circumferential frieze of a blue, knitted-looking pattern that appears strangely regular despite its perforated stretching.
DE_110	3	Like a delicate barrier that could rise into the air in the next moment.
DE_110	4	"""Prisoner of yourself"" is the title of this work, which has been screen-printed directly onto the museum wall."
DE_110	5	Rosemarie Trockel seems to say that my image as a knitting artist has haunted me for a long time; I am a victim of my success.
DE_110	6	But it's not that bad.
DE_110	7	"Could be a leitmotif for us all, says Susanne Pfeffer, director of the house: ""That we are all caught up in ourselves, in our own identity, in our gender, in our culture."
DE_110	8	"That it is actually a lifelong task to break out of these structures, which are often very rigid and violent."""
DE_110	9	Stove top reliefs and knitting pictures.
DE_110	10	"In a nearby film, Rosemarie Trockel has captured herself and interrogates her doppelganger with the question: ""Who is the best artist?""."
DE_110	11	"And it takes a long time, forced by physical and psychological abuse, before the interviewee finally answers: ""Rosemarie Trockel""."
DE_110	12	The artist has been walking this fine line between prejudice, self-observation, social values and defiant self-assertion for many decades: sleepwalkingly confident and delightfully humorous.
DE_110	13	Naturally, many of her knitting pictures with the wool seal ornament can be seen in Frankfurt.
DE_110	14	Or her stove-top reliefs, which mock the expected sphere of female creativity.
DE_110	15	"Two of them are connected to a socket, the plates become hot and start to glow, creating a whole new dimension of ""dangerous"" art."
DE_110	16	In the course of her career, Rosemarie Trockel has developed a wide range of tools to undermine and satirize social roles.
DE_110	17	Perpetrator?
DE_110	18	Victims?
DE_110	19	"""There is a work called 'Misleading Interpretation', where you can see her, a photo of her, but her eyes are covered with a black bar and her nose is bleeding and her hair is all wet,"" says Susanne Pfeffer."
DE_110	20	Ask yourself: has she just been a victim of violence or has she herself been violent?
DE_110	21	And she believes that this is also a fundamental question posed by Rosemarie Trockel: that it is sometimes impossible to tell when we are perpetrators and when we are victims.
DE_110	22	Large ceramic wall reliefs are particularly impressive.
DE_110	23	They look strangely metallic and are actually reminiscent of the surface texture of vegetable graters that women love to cut their fingers on.
DE_110	24	"""That's what makes her very unique formal language, that she always tries to go against the mainstream and use a material about which the experts say: that's not how it works,"" says Pfeffer."
DE_110	25	Room for ambivalence.
DE_110	26	At a time when the gender debate is becoming increasingly rigid, this extremely comprehensive exhibition of Rosemarie Trockel's work is delightfully liberal.
DE_110	27	Of course, the artist fights against the grandiose pathetic gestures of the male world of artists, but her work has truly not exhausted itself in this.
DE_110	28	If you allow ambivalences, says Susanne Pfeffer, you cannot look at people solely from the gender context.
DE_110	29	"""A person is not just a woman, not just a man, not just a child."
DE_110	30	So that's also very important for her.
DE_110	31	A person is also always many things.
DE_110	32	And you can also see and perceive it in very different ways.
DE_110	33	But allowing that to happen is really important to her.
DE_110	34	The magnificently presented exhibition ends with a glass cube in which square-cut pieces of knitted pictures are layered on top of each other.
DE_110	35	An ironic cross-reference to the pathos of minimal art, but also a relieved farewell to its clichéd reputation.
DE_110	36	When you see the display cases in which Rosemarie Trockel celebrates natural art forms - leaves, seed pods, dried flowers - then you finally realize that this artist keeps her eyes wide open and always knows how to find new ways to find inspiration.
DE_115	1	Fast with a pen: 17-year-old creates films and comics
DE_115	2	Drawing, writing, designing animated films, making music and recording albums - David Wiechert's talents would be enough for several creative minds.
DE_115	3	Maisach - The 17-year-old devotes himself to his many projects from morning to night.
DE_115	4	His biggest dream is to one day earn real money with his drawing and design skills - and ideally to combine them all.
DE_115	5	The first client contacted David Wiechert via the school.
DE_115	6	Those responsible at the Hans Stangl Foundation in Jesenwang found out about the young artist from a report in the Tagblatt newspaper.
DE_115	7	David was only 13 at the time, but had already produced his first comic book, taken part in comic festivals, sold pictures at markets and won second place in the district's youth art competition.
DE_115	8	For the Hans Stangl Foundation, he was asked to create a 2D animated film with a self-designed bee to illustrate the foundation's work.
DE_115	9	PC from the recycling center.
DE_115	10	A huge task for which the teenager did not even have the right equipment.
DE_115	11	Because his old PC from the recycling center was not equipped with the appropriate software, the foundation gave him a new device.
DE_115	12	David taught himself the elaborate animation program.
DE_115	13	He spent months drawing one picture after another on paper - because every tiny movement of the figures required a new picture - and finally filmed everything with his camera.
DE_115	14	The film can still be seen today on the foundation's homepage.
DE_115	15	"The ""KorBienian"" bee buzzes around children, senior citizens and athletes or stands at the blackboard as a teacher - because the foundation supports youth and elderly care, sport, education, art and culture."
DE_115	16	The movie is even accompanied by an appropriate whirring sound.
DE_115	17	Comic book.
DE_115	18	The 17-year-old now owns a drawing tablet and creates small animated films within a day - that's how fast he is with the pen.
DE_115	19	"""If we didn't see it with our own eyes, we wouldn't believe it,"" say his parents Thomas and Anja Wiechert."
DE_115	20	But some things do take longer - David's latest comic book, for example.
DE_115	21	It is his fifth and, at almost 200 pages, his largest project.
DE_115	22	"""I've been working on this for several months,"" he says."
DE_115	23	It's a story about wolves, archaic and a little dark.
DE_115	24	By the way: Everything from the region is now also available in our regular inspiration the young author gets from the Internet or from his great role model H.P..
DE_115	25	Lovecraft, an American writer who is considered the most important representative of fantastic horror literature of the 20th century.
DE_115	26	century.
DE_115	27	David also makes music on the side.
DE_115	28	"""I play guitar, flute and harmonica,"" he says."
DE_115	29	Using real DJ programs, he mixes the sounds together and creates his own animation for each one. He has already recorded 60 songs.
DE_115	30	Animation studio?
DE_115	31	But how do you turn all this into a sustainable career?
DE_115	32	David has already completed an internship at a film editing company.
DE_115	33	But it was boring, because he only had to optimize the colors and tones of foreign films.
DE_115	34	That's not for him in the long term.
DE_115	35	"He does not want to work on the brainchildren of others, but rather create things ""that arise from my mind""."
DE_115	36	David graduated from Dorothea-von-Haldenberg-Schule in Mammendorf last year as one of the best students.
DE_115	37	He could now attend the Fachoberschule (FOS) for design - he has already passed the entrance exam.
DE_115	38	"""But I don't actually want to go to school anymore,"" he says."
DE_115	39	"""I would like to learn something else, but the FOS is too unspecific for me."" He would much rather work in an animation studio, where he would like to be as artistically and technically challenged as possible."
DE_115	40	And preferably also write screenplays.
DE_116	1	"40 years of ""I want fun"" ""Petrol for three marks ten"""
DE_116	2	"Millions can sing along to it: the Neue Deutsche Welle song ""Ich will Spaß"" by Markus."
DE_116	3	The song was a number one hit 40 years ago.
DE_116	4	In June 1982, the song about an enthusiastic car driver entered the charts, and in August it spent two weeks at the top position in Germany.
DE_116	5	"The lyrics read, among other things: ""And even if gas costs three marks ten, it won't matter, it'll be fine!"
DE_116	6	"I want to drive!""."
DE_116	7	40 years later, the fuel price that was sung about as a horror back then would have felt like a bargain.
DE_116	8	Right?
DE_116	9	"The vocal ego of ""Ich will Spaß"" fills up on super: ""Will nicht spar'n, will nicht vernünftig sein, tank nur das gute Super rein""."
DE_116	10	"He drives an Italian luxury sports car and is against any speed limit: ""My Maserati goes two hundred and ten; poof, the police didn't see it""."
DE_116	11	"And at the petrol station, the man from ""I want fun"" is a welcome customer: ""The petrol station attendant is my best friend; ooh, when I come, how happy he is""."
DE_116	12	Consumer prices have doubled According to the ADAC, a liter of Super cost an average of 1.40 marks in 1982.
DE_116	13	Today, the price board at the filling station shows an average of around 2.20 euros for a liter of E10.
DE_116	14	However, price comparisons between the DM era and today's euro era are difficult, partly because the conversion rate fixed on New Year's Eve 1998 (1 euro = 1.95583 Deutschmarks) was based exactly on the value of the German currency at that time in relation to the other euro currencies.
DE_116	15	But this much can already be said: the price defined as a horror vision in the song has not yet been reached, even after the price jumps following the start of the war in Ukraine.
DE_116	16	Considering that the consumer price level has roughly doubled since 1982, the 3.10 marks accepted by singer Markus back then would correspond to a price of around 6.20 marks today ?
DE_116	17	or the equivalent of 3.17 euros.
DE_116	18	Nevertheless, the high price of fuel naturally hurts many drivers, especially as it is largely made up of taxes.
DE_116	19	"""Ich will Spaß"" singer Markus has a clear opinion on the current fuel prices."
DE_116	20	"He is ""actually in favor of a fuel price brake"", as he said when asked by dpa."
DE_116	21	"""For me personally, it should be 1.55 euros, because that would be 3.10 DM divided by two,"" says the singer, who was born in Bad Camberg in Hesse and is now 62 years old."
DE_116	22	"He appeals: ""Dear Federal Government, at least temporarily reduce ?"
DE_116	23	"Similar to the coronavirus crisis - taxes."""
DE_116	24	Then there will still be enough money for the state, he says.
DE_116	25	"A song describes an attitude to life Markus' ""Ich will Spaß"" is one of the biggest Neue Deutsche Welle hits ever."
DE_116	26	Time and again, it is also used as a general motto for the attitude to life of (male) youth.
DE_116	27	"Another success for Markus was the duet ""Kleine Taschenlampe brenn'"" with Nena."
DE_116	28	"Markus played the leading role alongside Nena in the movie ""Gib Gas, ich will Spaß"" (1983)."
DE_116	29	In recent years, Mörl has appeared repeatedly as a singer and also on television.
DE_116	30	"Five years ago, he and his partner Yvonne König, now 50, took part in the RTL reality show ""Das Sommerhaus der Stars ?"
DE_116	31	"Battle of the Celebrity Couples""."
DE_116	32	"In summer 2020, Markus and Yvonne got married on a Rhine boat live on television (RTLzwei). In 2021 he released the single ""Helden"" and in 2022 the hit ""Herzschlag""."
DE_116	33	"A new album is due to be released in the summer - entitled: ""Life loves me... and I love life""."
DE_126	1	"""New target of pro-Kremlin propagandists"": Russian campaign is likely to turn Germans against Ukrainians"
DE_126	2	The war in Ukraine is also an information war in which the warring parties want to achieve their goals with propaganda.
DE_126	3	Russia has now apparently identified German internet users as the cause.
DE_126	4	According to the Russian media, Ukrainian refugees are causing downright chaos in the host countries.
DE_126	5	Vandalized trains, arson, targeted benefit fraud, terror.
DE_126	6	At first glance, such reports seem authentic.
DE_126	7	That has a system.
DE_126	8	The Kremlin has been using targeted propaganda for years.
DE_126	9	A video recently circulated claiming that Ukrainian refugees had torched a house in an attempt to set fire to a Russian flag.
DE_126	10	"The video showed the ""Bild"" logo."
DE_126	11	But it had nothing at all to do with the clip.
DE_126	12	A similar story was reported by t-online in the summer.
DE_126	13	Pro-Russian videos using the portal's logo circulated on the internet.
DE_126	14	Codes from German media were technically integrated and even entire websites were copied.
DE_126	15	"""After clicking on a link, the environment appears deceptively real,"" the report said."
DE_126	16	"""The articles you read there and the videos you can watch with the logo of the media brands are clearly pro-Russian propaganda."" This type of disinformation is most likely part of a larger Russian strategy."
DE_126	17	"""We are in times of hybrid warfare,"" Austrian EU politician Lukas Mandl (ÖVP) recently told IPPEN.MEDIA ."
DE_126	18	This refers to a type of war that involves not only traditional military means, but also attacks via the internet, be it hacker attacks or targeted disinformation campaigns.
DE_126	19	The Federal Ministry of Defense is aware of this danger.
DE_126	20	"As early as 2016, it warned of ""disinformation as a means of hybrid warfare"" - and saw a targeted Russian campaign."
DE_126	21	"""Through so-called internet trolls and politically controlled media campaigns, the Kremlin is trying to influence the media, politics and public opinion in Western societies."" This was demonstrated six years ago when Russian media reported on a 13-year-old girl from Berlin."
DE_126	22	The daughter of German-Russian parents returned home the day after she was reported missing and told her parents that she had been raped by three southern men.
DE_126	23	As it soon turned out, this was a lie.
DE_126	24	Nevertheless, Russia-affiliated media such as RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik picked up the story, embellished it as they saw fit and accused the German authorities of a cover-up.
DE_126	25	Russian propaganda is currently directed primarily against Ukrainians who have fled to Europe.
DE_126	26	"Officially, there are 7.9 million people. from a ""new target of pro-Kremlin propagandists"": Turning Europeans against Ukrainians who have fled."
DE_126	27	"Germany is ""at the center of Moscow's information campaign""."
DE_126	28	"Russia is relying on fake internet posts, which Mark Zuckerberg's tech giant Meta describes as ""the largest and most complex Russian operation since the beginning of the war""."
DE_126	29	It is not yet clear whether this goal will be achieved.
DE_126	30	"""Lies about Ukrainian refugees and attempts to capitalize on Europeans' fears have not yet successfully polarized or shaped public discourse,"" according to a recent study by the European Policy Center supported by the European Parliament."
DE_126	31	"But the proportion of information hostile to Ukrainian refugees ""is increasing and generating greater engagement on social media,"" the study warned."
DE_126	32	Some false claims can be quickly refuted.
DE_126	33	For example, it quickly became clear that it was not Ukrainian refugees who were rioting on a regional train, but FC Augsburg fans.
DE_126	34	Fact checks help to clear up fake news, but are by no means the last word in wisdom: studies show that a) they are read by significantly fewer people than the original false claim, which in turn b) is also so successful because fake news in social media actually benefits from the algorithm.
DE_126	35	This also benefits Russian propaganda.
DE_127	1	"Germany prepares for scenarios in the Ukraine conflict: ""Should it come to an invasion ..."""
DE_127	2	"The German security authorities are preparing for ""every scenario"" in view of the Ukraine-Russia conflict."
DE_127	3	You are looking to exchange ideas with other EU countries.
DE_127	4	Berlin - What impact will the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have on Germany?
DE_127	5	The German security authorities are also concerned about this.
DE_127	6	"""The situation is extremely tense,"" the Federal Minister of the Interior told the Funke Mediengruppe newspapers."
DE_127	7	"And the SPD politician is also a little more specific: ""That's why we are preparing for every scenario and are very vigilant."
DE_127	8	"This applies to the protection of facilities in Germany, to the defense against cyber threats and to possible refugee movements towards our neighboring countries."""
DE_127	9	In view of the Russian troop deployment in the border region with Ukraine, the West fears that the deployment of tens of thousands of soldiers could serve to prepare for war.
DE_127	10	Russia has vehemently rejected this for weeks.
DE_127	11	The current conflict is also the dominant topic at the Munich Security Conference - even though Russia, of all countries, is staying away this year.
DE_127	12	Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock gave a remarkable speech on Friday in which she also got personal.
DE_127	13	The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung also quotes security circles: Should an invasion occur, migration movements, initially within Ukraine, but also in particular to neighboring countries, cannot be ruled out.
DE_127	14	"At present, however, there are still no indications of increased migration movements to Germany."" Conflict over Ukraine: wave of refugees to the EU possible."
DE_127	15	"In view of the growing tensions, the EU has already warned of possible refugee flows into the countries of the European Union: ""It is estimated that between 20,000 and more than one million refugees could arrive,"" said the Vice-President of the EU Commission, Margaritis Schinas, with a view to a possible military escalation in the world."
DE_127	16	Since Poland, for example, has a long border with Ukraine, many people are looking there.
DE_127	17	"""We are monitoring the situation in Ukraine very closely and are in close contact with the federal government, the federal states, the EU Commission and the other EU member states,"" continued Interior Minister Faeser."
DE_127	18	Ukraine conflict: Biden convinced of Putin's decision to invade.
DE_127	19	US President Joe Biden said on Friday (18.
DE_127	20	"February), he was ""convinced"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made the decision to invade neighboring Ukraine."
DE_127	21	"""We have reasons to believe that the Russian military is planning and intending to attack Ukraine in the coming week, in the coming days."" He added: ""We believe they will attack the Ukrainian capital Kiev, a city of 2.8 million innocent people."""
DE_128	1	Biden remains skeptical - USA plays out Russian invasion on the drawing board
DE_128	2	There is movement in the Ukraine showdown - and in the struggle between war and peace in Europe, there has recently been hope of a last-minute diplomatic solution.
DE_128	3	The Russian Ministry of Defense recently announced the end of the manoeuvre in Crimea.
DE_128	4	Nevertheless, US President Joe Biden remains skeptical and warned of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine in a televised address on Tuesday evening.
DE_128	5	"""We are ready to respond decisively to a Russian attack on Ukraine, which is still very clearly a possibility,"" Biden made clear."
DE_128	6	Biden responded cautiously to an announcement by the Russian Ministry of Defense to withdraw some troops.
DE_128	7	"""That would be good, but we haven't verified it yet,"" said the US President."
DE_128	8	"""We have not yet verified that Russian military units are returning to their bases."" Rather, US analysts have concluded that the Russian armed forces are still in a ""threatening position""."
DE_128	9	And Washington is obviously prepared for this.
DE_128	10	As has now become known, the White House had set up a separate advisory group to draw up strategies and plans for multiple war scenarios and their consequences.
DE_128	11	"Name of the group: ""Tiger Team""."
DE_128	12	At the table were experts, military advisors and government representatives, including from the State Department and the Departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security.
DE_128	13	War scenarios should have been played out in every detail - from strategic, limited troop advances to a complete war of conquest by Russian forces following a possible order to attack by Kremlin ruler Vladimir Putin.
DE_128	14	These included the occupation of the country and the removal of the elected President Volodymyr Selensky.
DE_128	15	The team sat together for hours and played out an invasion of the Eastern European country day by day.
DE_128	16	"The ""Tiger Team"" was set up within the National Security Council, the most important advisory body to US President Joe Biden, back in October, when the first troop movements towards the Ukrainian border were observed by intelligence services."
DE_128	17	Reason for the planning games: The White House wanted to avoid a fiasco similar to the one in Afghanistan, when the US withdrawal in the midst of the Taliban victory campaign turned into bloody chaos and 13 US soldiers died in a terrorist attack.
DE_128	18	"""Our hope is still that there is a diplomatic way to avoid all of this so that we never have to implement our concepts, our playbook,"" Jonathan Finer, Biden's deputy national security adviser, told The Washington Post."

DE_129	1	"Discussion on the war in Ukraine: ""We Europeans are stronger than Putin because we are democracies"""
DE_129	2	There are anniversaries that should not exist.
DE_129	3	One such date is 24.
DE_129	4	February, when the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine began.
DE_129	5	To mark the occasion, the city of Saarbrücken organized a discussion in the town hall with participants Lesya Matiyuk from the citizens' initiative UkraineFreundeSaar, Alexander Friedman from the Chair of European Contemporary History at Saarland University and Lord Mayor Uwe Conradt (CDU).
DE_129	6	Sabine Dengel (SPD), Head of Cultural Affairs, introduced and moderated the event.
DE_129	7	"It initially condemned Russia's invasion as a ""war of aggression without reason""."
DE_129	8	The whole situation has also presented the city of Saarbrücken with major challenges.
DE_129	9	Before the discussion, Friedman gave a keynote speech and began with the victims of the war, the youngest of whom was only two days old.
DE_129	10	There are now around 200,000 Russian soldiers killed and around 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers.
DE_129	11	"""This is the price for the phantom pains and imperial dreams of Soviet Union nostalgics,"" the Belarusian historian noted."
DE_129	12	The invasion of Ukraine is a prologue to an even bigger war, possibly a world war.
DE_129	13	"From Friedman's point of view, the talk of ""Putin's war"" has been a Western and especially German wishful thinking from the very beginning, which unfortunately has little to do with reality."
DE_129	14	The majority of Russians are still firmly behind their president, either out of conviction or indoctrinated by propaganda.
DE_129	15	"""So this is Russia's war,"" said Friedman."
DE_129	16	Demands for a renunciation of arms deliveries and compromises at the expense of Ukraine were evidence of political naivety.
DE_129	17	"He ended his short lecture with the exclamation ""Slava Ukrajini"", ""Glory to Ukraine"", which was popularized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj."
DE_129	18	Dengel then wanted to know from Friedman whether Russia would use nuclear weapons.
DE_129	19	This cannot be ruled out, as Putin has his back to the wall.
DE_129	20	On the other hand, Russian propaganda is deliberately threatening to stir up fear in the West.
DE_129	21	Matiyuk, who comes from southern Ukraine and holds a doctorate in German studies, was asked about the situation of Ukrainian refugees in Saarland.
DE_129	22	There are around 15,000 to 16,000 of them and they often feel very torn between their old and new homes.
DE_129	23	"""How do they perceive the German aid services?"
DE_129	24	""", Dengel wanted to know."
DE_129	25	Matiyuk stated that the Ukrainians could not understand the hesitant attitude of the German government, especially after masses of girls had been raped shortly after the start of the war.
DE_129	26	Of course, the image that the Russians get of the Germans through their state media is far worse, said Friedman.
DE_129	27	It describes the continuity of Germany from the Third Reich to the current Federal Republic.
DE_129	28	Calling others Nazis is a trademark of Russian propaganda.
DE_129	29	"""The world is very simple from their point of view."
DE_129	30	It consists of good people who are not Nazis.
DE_129	31	"But those who condemn Russia's policies are all Nazis."""
DE_129	32	Political broadcasts discuss in which German city it would be best to deploy nuclear weapons.
DE_129	33	Saarbrücken is not mentioned, but the US base at Ramstein is.
DE_129	34	According to Friedman, Putin is not interested in negotiations, which is why he thinks little of the appeal by Sarah Wagenknecht and Alice Schwarzer calling for them.
DE_129	35	However, Russia needs a breather in order to modernize its own army.
DE_129	36	The scientist from Saarland University said that we were probably dealing with a long, bloody war and compared it to the eight-year Iran-Iraq war 40 years ago.
DE_129	37	Matiyuk reported on the aid deliveries that she organizes from the Saarland with her association.
DE_129	38	Ukrainians are very self-critical and know that there is still a lot of corruption in the country, she said.
DE_129	39	For this reason, they are looking very closely at where the aid, such as power generators, is going.
DE_129	40	In addition, the company makes targeted enquiries with institutional partners in order to be able to supply what is actually needed.
DE_129	41	Mayor Conradt gave the closing speech.
DE_129	42	He called for more financial support for local authorities to help refugees.
DE_129	43	Less bureaucracy is also needed.
DE_129	44	As far as Russia was concerned, one had to ask oneself whether we had not collectively looked the other way for a long time, especially with regard to economic relations.
DE_129	45	"""What was so unimaginable on 24."

DE_129	47	""", asked the mayor, referring to Georgia, Crimea and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine."
DE_129	48	With regard to China as a trading partner, Conradt also said that we could not go on like this.
DE_129	49	For Ukraine, it is about peace and freedom.
DE_129	50	"""I think we all need to make another effort."
DE_129	51	Life in freedom is a permanent battle against the forces that fight against freedom.

DE_130	22	The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is dominated by Saudi Arabia, warned of an escalation of the situation.
DE_130	23	"""Threats on land or sea borders and on transportation and trade routes against any member of the Arab League are an unacceptable violation of Arab national security."""
DE_130	24	The Arab League comprises 21 Arab states in the Middle East and Africa as well as the Palestinian territories.

DE_137	1	Bosnia and Herzegovina: Parties agree on government formation
DE_137	2	An important point of contention between the parties was Bosnia and Herzegovina's attitude towards NATO.
DE_137	3	While the Croatian and Bosnian sides were in favor of joining NATO, the Serbian representation was against it.
DE_137	4	The government agreement now contains a vague promise to deepen the relationship with the Western defense alliance.
DE_137	5	The cabinet must now be formed within 30 days.
DE_137	6	Otherwise the government agreement would lose its validity, said the pro-Russian Serb leader Milorad Dodik (SNSPS) after the meeting.
DE_137	7	"The European Union welcomed the agreement as an ""important step forward""."
DE_137	8	The formation of a government is also necessary in order to drive forward the country's integration process into the EU.
DE_137	9	An EU spokeswoman called on the party representatives to ensure functioning institutions without delay.
DE_137	10	Bosnia and Herzegovina's political system is highly complex.
DE_137	11	It goes back to the Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the Bosnian war in the 1990s.
DE_137	12	It is particularly complicated because the democratic state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is made up of the Muslim and Croatian Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the one hand and the Serbian Republika Srpska on the other.
DE_137	13	Half of the country's 3.5 million inhabitants are Muslims, while around 30 percent are ethnic Serbs.
DE_137	14	The majority Catholic Croats, who make up 15 percent of the population, feel dominated by the Muslims.
DE_137	15	Nobody has taken the time here, which is why nothing works.
DE_137	16	No major project was carried through, at best it was started, then undone again because there was a lack of courage, or people realized that they had been making a mess of things the whole time.
DE_137	17	Since the state was founded, governments in Bosnia-Herzegovina have achieved virtually nothing.
DE_137	18	The major parties of the population groups are blocking each other in foreign and domestic policy.
DE_137	19	Even if they formally form a government.
DE_137	20	In terms of language, Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats are at most speakers of very close dialects and their religions (Orthodox, Islam, Catholic) differ only in the details.
DE_137	21	But the hatred resulting from the civil war and mafia structures keep bringing populists to power who work against each other and paralyze the state.
DE_137	22	"""The formation of a government is also necessary in order to advance the country's integration process into the EU."""
DE_137	23	The EU has long since exceeded its critical mass.
DE_137	24	And yet, instead of finally tackling the overdue internal renewal, it continues to burden itself.
DE_137	25	The British are already out, and now more Balkan states are joining them.
DE_137	26	They came together under pressure from the EU and the leading Serbian politician is directly threatening not to allow the government to come into being after all (if he doesn't get his preferred candidates through).
DE_137	27	Since he and his people will have the goals of the other two heads of state, such as rapprochement with the EU and NATO, torpedoed wherever possible, I estimate that the government will implement little or nothing this time either.
DE_137	28	Without agreement between the representatives in the presidency and the most important representatives of the two federal states, no important reforms will succeed in the state.
DE_137	29	This was all too rarely the case and will unfortunately remain rare.
DE_144	1	Abuse in war Maas and Jolie fight together against sexual violence
DE_144	2	With a UN Security Council resolution, Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas wants to give the global fight against sexual abuse in war more clout.
DE_144	3	dpa.
DE_144	4	Prior to the opening of the debate on Tuesday (today), Maas and the US actress Angelina Jolie, UN Special Envoy for Refugees, addressed the public together.
DE_144	5	Jolie has been campaigning against sexual violence in crisis areas for years and works for the UN refugee organization UNHCR.
DE_144	6	"In a joint guest article for the ""Washington Post"" on Monday, Maas and Jolie described examples of the fates of women in crisis countries."
DE_144	7	Among other things, they complained that the international community had been unable to prevent the atrocities in Syria and Myanmar.
DE_144	8	The Congolese doctor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege, who has treated three generations of raped women and girls from one family in his clinic in Congo, will report on his experiences to the UN Security Council.
DE_144	9	Jolie and Maas want the perpetrators to be brought to justice.
DE_144	10	To this end, crimes are to be systematically recorded and investigations facilitated.
DE_144	11	Victims should also be given more support and their complaints heard.
DE_144	12	"""Rape and other forms of sexual violence are used as a tactic of war and terror worldwide,"" Maas and Jolie wrote."
DE_144	13	All too often, perpetrators get away with it.
DE_144	14	"""This impunity has devastating consequences."" They added: ""We have both met survivors in countries such as Iraq, Bosnia and Sierra Leone who have urged us to address the lack of prosecution that allows sexual violence to continue."" Maas wants to use Germany's current presidency of the UN Security Council to advance the issue."
DE_144	15	For example, the Security Council is to adopt a resolution that outlines the consequences for supporters of sexual violence against women.
DE_144	16	Targeted sanctions against perpetrators and their leaders are also being considered.
DE_144	17	An informal working group is to deal with the issue.
DE_144	18	Back in 2000, at Namibia's initiative, the Security Council called in Resolution 1325 for women to be protected, included on an equal footing in peace negotiations and reconstruction and prosecuted for criminal offenses.
DE_144	19	In 2008, Resolution 1820, initiated by the USA, called for more action by states against sexual violence as a method of warfare and brought sexual violence into play as a deciding factor for sanctions.
DE_144	20	Pramila Patten, the UN Special Representative on Combating Sexual Violence in Conflict, has not seen any significant reduction in the number of cases despite years of efforts by the United Nations.
DE_144	21	She said in New York that one of the problems was that violence was often caused by non-state actors over whom the UN had no influence.
DE_154	1	Complaint to federal states ARD and ZDF allegedly waived funds
DE_154	2	This week, the collecting society Corint Media (formerly VG Medien) sent a nine-page complaint to the 16 heads of the German state chancelleries.
DE_154	3	It is about the fact that the public broadcasters do not take care of their ancillary copyrights.
DE_154	4	According to Corint, they lost tens of millions of euros as a result.
DE_154	5	However, this is only of secondary importance, because above all ARD and ZDF are distorting the German media market with this negligence and weakening the negotiating positions of German broadcasters and publishers vis-à-vis the digital groups in the long term.
DE_154	6	This will become important this summer when Germany implements the EU directives on copyright in a legislative package that was approved by the Bundestag last week and will be put to the vote in the Bundesrat on Friday.
DE_154	7	Corint Media is for private television and radio broadcasters and a number of publishers something like Gema for musicians and composers or VG Bildkunst for photographers and filmmakers.
DE_154	8	It ensures that royalties are paid and distributed.
DE_154	9	Corint Managing Director Markus Runde has long been struggling with the problem that ARD and ZDF simply give away a lot of their content and associated rights.
DE_154	10	"""This gives them a competitive advantage over others in the newly emerging rights licensing markets, which also have to finance themselves by enforcing their copyrights and ancillary copyrights."
DE_154	11	"Why should Facebook and Google pay appropriate remuneration for zeit.de when they can use the press product tagesschau.de for free?"""
DE_154	12	Especially now that the digital groups have reduced the advertising markets for traditional media to a fraction of their former revenues.
DE_154	13	"""You can only afford this generous attitude if you are not dependent on such financing options."""
DE_154	14	Like the public broadcasters, who earn billions every year through license fees.
DE_154	15	"""At the time, the public broadcasters had seven years to make efforts to obtain their ancillary copyrights"" It still seems a little early to complain about the squandering of a right that has not even come into force yet."
DE_154	16	Round finds it rather too late.
DE_154	17	There was already an ancillary copyright for the press.
DE_154	18	This was issued in August 2013, but withdrawn in 2019 due to legal formal errors.
DE_154	19	"""The public broadcasters had seven years to enforce their ancillary copyrights, but simply failed to do so and did nothing to secure advantages in the presentation of their content on these large platforms."
DE_154	20	"We want to avoid increasing this distortion of competition to the detriment of private press products and broadcasters on the one hand and license fee payers on the other when the new law comes into effect."""
DE_154	21	The complaints in the letter, which is available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, are very detailed.
DE_154	22	Corint has calculated that the ARD and ZDF radio and television stations have foregone around 4.3 million euros per year.
DE_154	23	Because this concerns the use of the stations in commercial and public facilities such as hotels, fitness centers, hospitals, retirement and nursing homes, this is still low compared to the license fees that the stations' news portals on the Internet could have demanded for licenses.
DE_154	24	Corint would generate between 37 and 54 million euros per year for tagesschau.de alone.
DE_154	25	This waiver is a problem for private-sector media such as RTL, Pro 7, but also Der Spiegel and Süddeutsche Zeitung (which is not a member of Corint Media) primarily because the digital groups could in future be more likely to use content from providers who do not exercise their performance rights.
DE_154	26	ARD headquarters has not yet received the complaint.
DE_154	27	Nevertheless, a reaction comes from the WDR headquarters in Cologne.
DE_154	28	"""Public service broadcasting is subject to different restrictions and requirements than commercial broadcasters and press companies represented by Corint Media,"" it says."
DE_154	29	"""From ARD's point of view, it is particularly wrong that the state broadcasters could claim the ancillary copyright of the press publisher for themselves."
DE_154	30	You are not a protected producer of press products.
DE_154	31	They were therefore not entitled to the ancillary copyright introduced into German copyright law in 2013.
DE_154	32	We also informed VG Media of this at the time upon request.
DE_154	33	The same applies to the new European ancillary copyright law, the implementation of which has just been passed by the Bundestag.
DE_154	34	This is also only granted to press publishers for press publications.
DE_154	35	"At this point in time, we can therefore only take note of the accusations with irritation."""
DE_154	36	"Markus Runde is concerned about the rifts in the German media industry: ""On the user side, there are monolithic blocks like Google and Facebook, tightly organized global corporations that have completely different options."
DE_154	37	On the rights provider side, there is a fractured field of publishers and other content providers.
DE_154	38	"Content providers will only overcome the asymmetry between publishers, broadcasters and exploiters if they jointly enforce their rights against the exploiters, ideally even at European level."""
DE_162	1	Guaidó courts the military: Power struggle in Venezuela: Maduro relies on the military
DE_162	2	"In the power struggle in Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has called on the armed forces to be ready to defend themselves against an ""imperialist conspiracy""."
DE_162	3	In the state of Cojedes, he visited a maneuver on Saturday in which 5,000 soldiers took part.
DE_162	4	"""A handful of traitors who sell out to the US will not stain the honor of our armed forces,"" Maduro said at the El Pao military base."
DE_162	5	According to the Colombian television station NTN24, all seven people on board died in the crash of a military helicopter that was accompanying Maduro's flight to the garrison.
DE_162	6	The cause of the accident was initially unknown.
DE_162	7	In a failed military uprising on Tuesday, some of those in uniform joined the self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
DE_162	8	On Friday, the public prosecutor's office issued 18 arrest warrants for military personnel and civilians on charges of treason.
DE_162	9	No arrest warrant has been issued for Guaidó.
DE_162	10	Maduro has so far avoided a direct confrontation with his challenger.
DE_162	11	Guaidó called on the population to march to army barracks and bases in order to persuade the military to change sides.
DE_162	12	Demonstrators read out a statement by Guaidó in front of the naval command in Caracas and other military units.
DE_162	13	"The military has a decisive role to play in the reconstruction of democracy in Venezuela, according to the appeal to the military, as reported by the newspaper ""El Nacional""."
DE_162	14	However, the military leadership, which occupies important positions in the economy, has so far stood by Maduro.
DE_162	15	Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is planning talks with his Venezuelan counterpart Jorge Arreaza on the future of the Latin American crisis country.
DE_162	16	At the meeting in Moscow on Sunday, possible solutions to the power struggle within the framework of the Venezuelan constitution will be discussed, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Saturday.
DE_162	17	The economic situation following the US sanctions against Maduro's leadership was also to be discussed, according to reports.
DE_162	18	Russia and the USA accuse each other of exacerbating the crisis in Venezuela.
DE_162	19	Washington supports Guaidó.
DE_162	20	Russia, for its part, has sent military advisors to Venezuela to support the pro-government armed forces and is backing Maduro.
DE_162	21	On Friday, Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump spoke on the phone about the escalation in the conflict, among other things.
DE_162	22	On Monday, Lavrov is due to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the margins of the Arctic Council in Finland.
DE_162	23	The situation in Venezuela will also be discussed.
DE_162	24	On Saturday, Pompeo accused Maduro's government of serious misconduct.
DE_162	25	"""The repression perpetrated by Nicolás Maduro is limitless,"" Pompeo wrote on Twitter."
DE_162	26	Government forces attacked a Catholic church service, drove into the church on motorcycles, used tear gas and injured many people.
DE_162	27	"""We stand with the Venezuelan people and with Interim President Juan Guaidó,"" Pompeo wrote."
DE_163	1	Terror in Vienna puts Nehammer under pressure
DE_163	2	Possible omissions by the authorities in the run-up to the Islamist attack in Vienna are putting Interior Minister Karl Nehammer (ÖVP) under increasing pressure.
DE_163	3	In the National Council session on Thursday, the FPÖ tabled a motion of censure against Nehammer on the occasion of the attack, which was also approved by the SPÖ.
DE_163	4	"The NEOS did not go along ""today"", but threatened to do so next time."
DE_163	5	A call to resign came from the ranks of the Green coalition partner.
DE_163	6	Martin Margulies, local councillor and budget spokesman for the Vienna Green Party, vented his anger on Twitter.
DE_163	7	"""Why is @karlnehammer still in office?"
DE_163	8	He doesn't have his departments under control.
DE_163	9	A recognizable terrorist attack was not prevented.
DE_163	10	Four people died.
DE_163	11	And all this becomes known within 48 hours.
DE_163	12	"What's next?"""
DE_163	13	Nehammer himself, the Vienna Police Commissioner Gerhard Pürstl and the Director General for Public Security, Franz Ruf, appeared in public again this afternoon and announced new details about the ongoing investigations.
DE_163	14	According to the report, eight of the 15 suspected Islamists arrested after the terrorist attack in Vienna have already been convicted of various crimes, two of them for an attempted honor killing in Linz.
DE_163	15	Investigations outside Austria.
DE_163	16	It was also announced that one line of investigation leads to Switzerland and another to another country.
DE_163	17	Which country this is was not revealed.
DE_163	18	At the same time as the press conference in Vienna, however, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced from Germany that the Viennese assassin had links to Germany.
DE_163	19	"""Due to the case in Vienna, we also have links to Germany to dangerous individuals who are monitored around the clock,"" said the CSU politician in the Bundestag on Thursday."
DE_163	20	Read also: Kurz calls for a new approach to dealing with dangerous people Nehammer, Pürstl and Ruf also had to explain their massive criticism of the authorities, according to which they had failed to prevent the attack.
DE_163	21	"Pürstl rejected these accusations and said that ""we have done a good job""."
DE_163	22	However, it emerged from his statements that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT) did not take offensive action against the assassin in Slovakia following indications of an attempted purchase of ammunition by him, but only initiated a risk assessment.
DE_163	23	Sharp criticism from the opposition.
DE_163	24	In parliament, the three opposition parties gave the Minister of the Interior a good talking to and demanded a complete investigation.
DE_163	25	"The leader of the Freedom Party and former Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) said to his successor: ""What you call a communication error was the death sentence for four innocent people."""
DE_163	26	The attack could have been prevented if he had known what to do as Interior Minister, Kickl suggested to Nehammer that he should resign.
DE_163	27	The Social Democrats were not sparing with their criticism either.
DE_163	28	It is not about obfuscation, distraction and platitudes, it is also about taking personal responsibility, recommended party and club leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner to the ÖVP minister.
DE_163	29	Now the events must be dealt with honestly and with the courage to admit mistakes.
DE_163	30	The commission of inquiry announced by Nehammer does not appear to be the appropriate instrument for this, according to Jörg Leichtfried, deputy chairman of the parliamentary group.
DE_163	31	Parliamentary control is needed, he demanded.
DE_163	32	"Also interesting: Terror in Vienna - What's behind ""Schleich di, du Oaschloch""?"
DE_163	33	NEOS leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger is in favor of the commission, but she wants the opposition to have a say, including in the question of the chairmanship.
DE_163	34	Overall, it took a much more moderate approach than the SPÖ and FPÖ, although it also disliked Kurz and Nehammer's attacks on the judiciary.
DE_163	35	"She called them ""shabby""."
DE_163	36	The ÖVP, for its part, pushed for more powers for law enforcement authorities in the pursuit of terrorism.
DE_163	37	Chancellor Kurz stated that the legal means to monitor and sanction Islamic extremists and other dangerous individuals were not always available at present.
DE_171	1	St. Martin: soldier against his will, pacifist by conviction
DE_171	2	Almost every child knows that St. Martin shares his coat with the poor beggar.
DE_171	3	It is probably less well known that the Roman soldier did not actually want to be a soldier - but that he was effectively a conscientious objector.
DE_171	4	"""No one may be forced to do military service with a weapon against their conscience."""
DE_171	5	The young Martin of Tours would probably also have referred to this sentence from the Basic Law.
DE_171	6	However, in his time in the Roman Empire, there was of course no constitutional right to conscientious objection as there has been in Germany since 1949.
DE_171	7	One of the first conscientious objectors?
DE_171	8	So the future churchman initially followed in his father's footsteps as a Roman soldier, explains Protestant theologian Uwe Metz.
DE_171	9	Martin's father was a tribune, and according to the custom of the time, it was customary for the son to follow in his father's footsteps.
DE_171	10	"""But he really only did it against his will - because he was a soldier and he was baptized."
DE_171	11	"And he then made up his mind to say: ""The military and the Christian - that's not compatible, so he actually resigned from the service very early on."" He became a gun refuser - citing the Christian faith: ""Thou shalt not kill."
DE_171	12	Not the first conscientious objector, but certainly one of the best known.
DE_171	13	At that time, in late antiquity, Christian pacifism was very widespread, according to the theologian Metz.
DE_171	14	"""All things military and soldierly were not a matter for the church or the Christian faith, they were left to the rulers."""
DE_171	15	Reach for the sword to divide the coat.
DE_171	16	After all, Jesus also called for non-violence and love of enemies.
DE_171	17	Martin, who later became Bishop of Tours, only took up arms once during his short time as a soldier.
DE_171	18	And that is what he is best known for today, says Metz.
DE_171	19	"""The only time St. Martin wielded a sword was when he divided the cloak."""
DE_171	20	"The theologian Metz deduces from this: ""As a true Christian, you can only be a pacifist."""
DE_171	21	"For a long time, the idea of a ""just war"" was the order of the day. However, the churches have not always remained as faithful to their pacifist beginnings as St. Martin."
DE_171	22	"For centuries, the doctrine of ""just war"", which was introduced into the tradition of the Church by the Doctor of the Church, Augustine, a contemporary of St. Martin of all people."
DE_171	23	Today, both major churches have military bishops who see themselves primarily as pastors for soldiers.
DE_171	24	Andreas Quirin is a soldier and a Catholic.
DE_171	25	No contradiction for him.
DE_171	26	In principle, all people, including soldiers, love peace.
DE_171	27	"""There is no one who is just waiting with a knife between their teeth to finally be allowed to go to war and then use violence,"" says Quirin."
DE_171	28	"Nevertheless, it is also clear: ""Of course, we are not an armed, technical aid organization that is only sent out to drill wells or build houses."""
DE_171	29	Being a faithful soldier - no contradiction?
DE_171	30	And that is the right thing to do in cases where soldiers take up arms.
DE_171	31	He also has the support of the community of Catholic soldiers, of which Quirin is the chairman.
DE_171	32	"In such cases, the devout soldier does not believe in pacifism without violence or weapons: ""I think that's an absolutely naive idea."
DE_171	33	"The beginnings in Afghanistan have shown that military force is of course needed to put those who are aggressively trying to assert their interests in their place and then to make it possible to provide civilian reconstruction aid."""
DE_171	34	However, the use of weapons is always the last resort because everyone knows that this would have devastating consequences that nobody wants.
DE_171	35	St. Martin as a role model for soldiers today.
DE_171	36	So has St. Martin and his Christian pacifism become obsolete as a role model?
DE_171	37	Not at all, says Quirin.
DE_171	38	After all, even soldiers do not act unethically, but rather - like Martin - they must always put their actions to the test before their conscience and God.
DE_171	39	"""Of course, that's something that should actually be standard for us soldiers in this day and age, that we take a critical view of certain things and question certain things."
DE_171	40	"And in that respect, I think it's a good example that could also apply to us today."""
DE_174	1	"Venus was probably always a hostile ""hell"""
DE_174	2	Venus, Earth's sister planet, may never have harbored oceans.
DE_174	3	This is presumably what new computer simulations suggest.
DE_174	4	The climate therefore did not allow water vapor to condense there.
DE_174	5	The new findings contradict earlier estimates that there may once have been oceans on young Venus.
DE_174	6	By comparison, there have been oceans on Earth for almost four billion years.
DE_174	7	Experts are divided as to whether liquid water has ever eaten its way into Venus.
DE_174	8	"A team led by astrophysicist Martin Turbet from the University of Geneva has now added another piece to the puzzle in the journal ""Nature""."
DE_174	9	"""We simulated the climate of Earth and Venus at the very beginning of their evolution, more than four billion years ago, when the surfaces of the planets were still molten,"" Turbet is quoted as saying in a press release from the University of Geneva."
DE_174	10	At that time, the celestial bodies resembled a gigantic pressure cooker.
DE_174	11	And according to the researchers, the temperatures on Venus were never low enough for the water vapor in the atmosphere to condense and pour down on the planet in the form of rain.
DE_174	12	This is because clouds, which preferentially formed on the night side of the planet, created an enormous greenhouse effect that prevented Venus from cooling down sufficiently - and thus the formation of oceans.
DE_174	13	Several missions to Venus planned Over the next ten years, the European and American space agencies ESA and NASA will send three missions to Venus.
DE_174	14	And the United Arab Emirates also want to launch a probe in 2028 to orbit the planet and collect data.
DE_174	15	"The observations obtained will be crucial ""to confirm - or refute - our work,"" said Geneva professor and co-author of the study, David Ehrenreich."
DE_174	16	"""If the authors are correct, Venus has always been a hellhole,"" write US researchers James Kasting and Chester Harman in an article accompanying the study."
DE_174	17	"In fact, Venus today is a ""hellhole"": the thick atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, the air pressure is incredibly high and temperatures are around 470 degrees Celsius day and night."
DE_174	18	The astrophysicists also showed in their simulations that the Earth only narrowly avoided the same fate as Venus.
DE_174	19	If the Earth had orbited the sun just a little more closely or if our central star had shone as brightly as it does today, it would now be just as inhospitable a planet as Venus.
DE_174	20	Third smallest planet in our solar system Venus - with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers almost as large as our Earth - is the second innermost and third smallest planet in the solar system with an average distance to the sun of 108 million kilometers.
DE_174	21	Earth's inner neighbor orbits our central star in just under 225 days.
DE_174	22	However, because the planet rotates very slowly on its own axis, a Venus day is longer than a Venus year at 243 Earth days.
DE_174	23	The planet is enveloped by a closed, opaque cloud cover, its atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of nitrogen, water vapor and sulfur dioxide as well as traces of gases.

DE_192	8	Boris Becker was sentenced to two and a half years in prison at Southwark Crown Court in London.
DE_192	9	In addition to fans and supporters of the six-time Grand Slam champion, many of Becker's companions also spoke out after the verdict.
DE_192	10	Among them is Lilly Becker , to whom the 54-year-old has been married since 2009.
DE_192	11	"Lilly Becker, who has been living separately from Boris Becker since the couple separated in 2018, expressed her surprise at the severity of the ruling in an interview with RTL's ""Exklusiv Weekend""."

DE_192	15	Lilly Becker (here at the recording of a TV show in 2017) was shocked by the prison sentence against Boris Becker.
DE_192	16	"Daughter Anna Ermakova - ""I'm really in shock, Boris Becker's daughter Anna Ermakova , who was born out of a brief relationship with Angela Ermakova, was also visibly shocked by her father's prison sentence."
DE_192	17	"""I'm really in shock that my father has been sentenced to two years and six months,"" the 22-year-old told Bild ."
DE_192	18	"""I helped as much as I could."
DE_192	19	I wrote a letter to the court to express my concerns about my little half-brother Amadeus.
DE_192	20	He is only twelve and will now have to do without a father figure, who he will miss during a difficult phase of his development.
DE_192	21	It's not fair to him.
DE_192	22	"It will be hard for Amadeus,"" Ermakova continues."
DE_192	23	But just like her half-brother's mother, Anna Ermakova continues to stand behind Boris Becker and wants to support her father even in his most difficult times.
DE_192	24	Among other things, she wants to visit him in prison as often as she can to help him get through this time.
DE_192	25	Boris Becker is said to have transferred even larger sums of money after his insolvency in 2017 and failed to fulfill his duty to provide information in other areas.
DE_192	26	The 54-year-old was found guilty on four of the 24 charges.
DE_193	1	Tennis player Novak Ðjoković: lifted off and landed hard
DE_193	2	Novak Ðjoković, number 1 in men's tennis, is currently probably the second most famous prisoner in the world behind Julien Assange.
DE_193	3	"Although ""detainee"" is an exaggeration, at least according to the Australian government, under whose authority the Serbian is being held. After all, the ""Djoker"" is ""only serving a temporary sentence"" in a deportation hotel in Melbourne and ""can leave again at any time"", according to Australian Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews."
DE_193	4	The fact that the Serb ticks differently than most is nothing new.
DE_193	5	"The 20-time Grand Slam champion had phases in which he was coached by a ""guru""; during the first lockdown, he thought it was a good idea to organize a series of tournaments on the Adriatic, where several professionals and he himself were infected with corona."
DE_193	6	"He did an egg dance around his participation in the Australian Open and his ""vaccination status"" because he knew that the tournament was to take place under 2G conditions."
DE_193	7	An egg dance that has brought him to where he is now.
DE_193	8	However, this impressive case of an unruly megastar offers so many twists and turns that the use of tennis metaphors seems obvious.
DE_193	9	It's a drama, a five-set match; or smaller: Ðjoković was passed hard, gave up his serve, but now, after a short break, still has every chance.
DE_193	10	Although it doesn't look good for him.
DE_193	11	There are so many levels and sides to this case that you can't keep up.
DE_193	12	On the one hand, there is the parallel world of top-class sport and one of its richest and most headstrong representatives; on the other, there is a harsh state that does not like to show itself to be cosmopolitan and foreign-friendly.
DE_193	13	We have corona entry rules that apply to everyone, which means that the other world formula, according to which the rich and people with influence can go anywhere, is suspended for a brief moment in history.
DE_193	14	We have a father who stands up for his son, from a nation that almost traditionally feels disadvantaged and does not shy away from conflict; we have protesters here and there.
DE_193	15	And in the middle of it all is Ðjoković, who is stuck in Melbourne alongside countless asylum seekers, waiting for the next court decision.
DE_193	16	Yet everything could be so simple.
DE_193	17	"Even people like Rafael Nadal and Boris Becker, two other greats of ""white sport"", say so."
DE_193	18	"But ""Novax"" prefers to remain unvaccinated ""in the best tradition of Balkan idiocy"" (according to the Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji List) and play against windmills."
DE_193	19	Because as this case makes clear: the times when your own state of health was a private matter are unfortunately over.
DE_205	1	Brexit: Government seeks way out in marathon meeting
DE_205	2	The British government met on Tuesday for crisis consultations on a way out of the Brexit impasse.
DE_205	3	A longer cabinet meeting is planned into the afternoon with different members.
DE_205	4	On Monday evening, Parliament once again failed to reach an agreement in a vote on alternatives to May's Brexit agreement.
DE_205	5	According to reports, the head of government could now present the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the EU to MPs for a fourth time.
DE_205	6	Parliament will try again on Wednesday.
DE_205	7	However, a further round of votes in the House of Commons on alternatives to May's Brexit deal was initially planned for Wednesday.
DE_205	8	According to speculation, however, parliament could also try to force the government to extend the withdrawal deadline further.
DE_205	9	British Education Secretary Damian Hinds continues to back Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal.
DE_205	10	"""The deal negotiated by the government is the most balanced and I hope and expect that's where we'll end up,"" Hinds said on BBC television."
DE_205	11	"""It's still by far the best option."""
DE_205	12	Negotiations with the EU will come one way or another.
DE_205	13	"The EU wants to insist on the clarification of outstanding Brexit issues even in the event of a ""no deal"" scenario."
DE_205	14	However, if no agreement is reached, the atmosphere will be different, EU Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier told the European Parliament on Tuesday.
DE_205	15	"""A no deal is a breach of trust."""
DE_205	16	Even in the event of a disorderly, hard Brexit, it would not take long for the UK to request negotiations with the EU on trade, transport and other issues, Barnier said.
DE_205	17	The outstanding issues that were actually supposed to be settled in the withdrawal agreement, such as the Irish border, the final Brexit bill of around 39 billion pounds (45.44 billion euros) and the rights of EU citizens, would then come back into play.
DE_205	18	"""We will then put these questions back on the table,"" said Barnier."
DE_205	19	ECB sees financial sector well prepared.
DE_205	20	According to the head of the French central bank, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the European financial sector is prepared for a hard Brexit.
DE_205	21	"""We have made all preparations at European and national level, including in the event of a no-deal exit, to ensure that contracts continue to be honored and that customers in the financial sector are protected,"" the ECB Governing Council member told ""France Inter Radio""."
DE_205	22	As things stand at present, Great Britain will enter the EU on 12.
DE_205	23	April from the European Union.
DE_205	24	If neither the withdrawal agreement nor an alternative is agreed by then, there is a threat of a no-deal exit with drastic consequences for the economy and many other areas of life.
DE_223	1	Revocation of patent protection for vaccines: What industry and patent lawyers have to say
DE_223	2	Pfizer boss Albert Bourla is strictly opposed to the removal of patent protection, not least because this would not increase production.
DE_223	3	The difficult production process in mRNA technology is time-consuming and especially now, when time is of the essence, cannot be mastered simply by making changes to patent law.
DE_223	4	In order to process the 280 components currently used from 86 suppliers from 19 countries, complex special systems and trained personnel are required.
DE_223	5	Moderna boss Stéphane Bancel takes a similar view.
DE_223	6	The head of the US biotech company, which produces the second mRNA-based drug approved in the USA and the European Union, believes that patent approval this year or next will not really speed up availability.
DE_223	7	"There is simply ""not enough talent in the world and not enough production facilities that can reliably guarantee complex production."""
DE_223	8	"Even if all patents were indeed freely available, others would ""first have to develop their own manufacturing processes and have their product approved""."
DE_223	9	This also takes many months.
DE_223	10	BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin believes that patents are not a limiting factor for the global vaccine supply.
DE_223	11	He is even thinking of granting licenses to selected producers.
DE_223	12	His Moderna competitor Bancel takes a similar view.
DE_223	13	He does not want to sue other companies that use his patents during the coronavirus crisis, but will certainly grant licenses afterwards.
DE_223	14	The pharmaceutical industry, on the other hand, takes a different view: it sees vaccines more as a commodity.
DE_223	15	"Han Steutel, President of the German Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies ( ), told Handelsblatt: ""The manufacturers of mRNA vaccines have done more than ten years of groundwork to be able to help the world now."
DE_223	16	"Where are saving ideas supposed to come from in the next pandemic and who is supposed to finance their implementation until they are ready for production when everyone knows that the inventors' patents will be taken away anyway?"""
DE_223	17	Patent law experts take a similar view.
DE_223	18	"Tim Reinhard, partner at the international commercial law firm Osborne Clarke, says: ""It is dangerous if pharmaceutical and biotech companies have to fear that the fruits of their research will be confiscated in the future and that they will be forced to disclose their research results without adequate compensation."""
DE_223	19	"Patent lawyer Ralph Nack from the commercial law firm Noerr points out: ""However, we will also need courageous and well-funded investors in future crises, and they will rely in particular on patent protection when making their investment decisions."""
DE_223	20	Claudia Milbradt from the law firm Clifford Chance sees yet another possibility to remedy the vaccine shortage through state intervention.
DE_223	21	It is calling for an obligation to hand over the raw materials, but the Americans are currently refusing to do so - as can be seen from the example of India.
DE_223	22	This could at least remedy the lack of raw material supplies for vaccines.
DE_223	23	According to the Chatham House think tank, there is also a lack of glass vials, bioreactor bags for cell cultures, fetal calf serum as a medium for cell cultures and nanoparticles in which some vaccines have to be stored in order to increase production capacity.
DE_223	24	The problem of how long the high demand will continue to determine the price will not last much longer anyway, as the established coronavirus vaccine manufacturers are pursuing gigantic production plans: BioNTech and Pfizer together are planning to produce around 2.5 billion doses in 2021 and Moderna wants to produce up to one billion units.
DE_230	1	Supply Chain Act: The question of liability
DE_230	2	The German government has been at odds over the Supply Chain Act for months.
DE_230	3	It is intended to oblige German companies to comply with human rights due diligence obligations with their suppliers around the world.
DE_230	4	The biggest point of contention is the question of companies' liability if they violate these duties of care.
DE_230	5	Employment Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) and Development Aid Minister Gerd Müller (CSU) are in favor of a liability mechanism and have the backing of civil society, trade unions and churches.
DE_230	6	Economics Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) is against this, as are the leading German business associations.
DE_230	7	However, there are also companies and associations that are in principle in favor of liability.
DE_230	8	The European brand association AIM, which represents around 2,500 companies such as Beiersdorf, Nestlé and Puma, stated with regard to a European supply chain law: companies should be able to be held liable for not having established and applied sufficient due diligence procedures.
DE_230	9	The three ministries want to try again this week to resolve the dispute over the issue.
DE_230	10	It is necessary to finally talk about what liability could look like in order to find a compromise, says Cornelia Heydenreich from the Supply Chain Act Initiative.
DE_230	11	In fact, the impression that only a supply chain law provides a liability basis for lawsuits is wrong.
DE_230	12	In fact, Section 823 of the German Civil Code already provides such a basis for liability, which generally applies to all companies, whether large or small.
DE_230	13	However, Ministers Heil and Müller actually want to define civil liability more precisely in a supply chain law and thus simplify the legal options for those affected.
DE_230	14	This is what the original but unpublished key points of the law envisage.
DE_230	15	Companies could protect themselves - without solving a problem.
DE_230	16	Even companies that are generally committed to a supply chain law with enforcement mechanisms have their doubts about the usefulness of civil liability.
DE_230	17	"There is a danger that companies will then act in such a way ""that they are as well protected as possible against lawsuits"", said Tchibo manager Nanda Bergstein last week at a hearing in the Bundestag's Human Rights Committee."
DE_230	18	Companies could, for example, rely on private auditing companies to check suppliers.
DE_230	19	In the past, problems have not been solved in this way.
DE_230	20	"""In the worst case, there are even incentives to conceal the actual conditions so that they are not held accountable,"" said Bergstein."
DE_230	21	In contrast, the human rights organization ECCHR, which has supported lawsuits against KiK or TÜV Süd in German courts, considers civil liability in the Supply Chain Act to be indispensable.
DE_230	22	"Liability for injury to life, limb, property and other rights within the meaning of Section 823 of the German Civil Code (BGB) is not sufficient, said lawyer Miriam Saage-Maaß at the hearing: ""What is needed is an expansion of the protected goods to include the recognized catalog of human rights."""
DE_230	23	Nevertheless, a compromise by the German government could include waiving extended civil liability within a supply chain law.
DE_230	24	If companies fail to comply with due diligence obligations, fines of up to ten percent of turnover could be imposed and the company could be excluded from public procurement procedures or foreign trade promotion.
DE_230	25	With strong enforcement by the authorities, the focus would be on prevention, i.e. preventing damage from occurring in the first place.
DE_230	26	However, some of those involved wonder whether an authority could fulfill this task effectively.
DE_230	27	Those in favor of a compromise believe that the creation of a supply chain law alone will make it easier for those affected to take legal action.
DE_230	28	However, according to negotiating circles, it was previously considered a red line of the SPD to waive civil liability in the Supply Chain Act.
DE_230	29	Christian Socialist Development Minister Gerd Müller is considered more flexible on this point.
DE_230	30	He is primarily concerned with the introduction of a regulation for supply chains.
DE_230	31	So far, Economics Minister Altmaier has made little progress on the issue of liability.
DE_233	1	German companies in Russia: Square, practical, angry
DE_233	2	German companies in Russia Square, practical, angry.
DE_233	3	German companies such as Ritter Sport are still active in war-torn Russia.
DE_233	4	There are many reasons for this.
DE_233	5	For weeks, companies that continue to do business in Russia have been harshly criticized.
DE_233	6	"The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, shared a picture on Twitter of a bar of Ritter Sport chocolate and a variation of its slogan - ""Square."
DE_233	7	Practical.
DE_233	8	"Blood."" - because the company continues to sell chocolate in Russian supermarkets."
DE_233	9	In the weeks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, some companies, including VW, Continental and Obi, shut down their operations.
DE_233	10	However, many companies have decided to remain in Russia for the time being.
DE_233	11	It is not known how many of the approximately 3,500 German companies that still existed at the beginning of the war have since frozen their production or left the country altogether.
DE_233	12	Both large companies and medium-sized enterprises for which Russia is a large sales market, such as the machine manufacturers Liebherr and Grimme, the Globus supermarket chain and Ritter Sport, have remained.
DE_233	13	The chocolate manufacturer's main reason for remaining in its second most important market is that it would have to discontinue some of its production in Germany and Austria and its cooperation with cocoa farmers and their collectives if they withdrew.
DE_233	14	They promise to donate all their profits from Russia to aid organizations and have already stopped all investments and advertising measures.
DE_233	15	Whether the company makes profits transparent and to which organizations donations are made was not disclosed to taz.
DE_233	16	"Henkel also stated that it had stopped all investment, sponsorship and advertising expenditure and was only producing and supplying ""everyday goods"" such as cleaning agents."
DE_233	17	Like most companies, Henkel defends its decision by saying it has a responsibility to its employees.
DE_233	18	The Russian government had threatened executives of companies that had left the country with legal consequences.
DE_233	19	However, no such cases are known to date.
DE_233	20	Companies fear being expropriated.
DE_233	21	The reluctance of companies is also due to the fact that a law is being prepared in Russia with the help of which foreign companies can be expropriated if they withdraw from the Russian market, even temporarily.
DE_233	22	The law is intended to secure jobs and production capacities.
DE_233	23	This would make a return after the war very expensive at the very least.
DE_233	24	Pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer and Fresenius in particular also argue that they sell essential medicines and services.
DE_233	25	Fresenius operates more than 100 dialysis centers for kidney and liver patients.
DE_233	26	"At the request of the taz, Bayer writes that it will only continue to sell ""indispensable"" products, but would not comment on the criteria it uses to select these and whether, for example, the headache tablet Aspirin is also meant."
DE_233	27	In addition to medical products, Bayer also supplies seeds to Russian farmers.
DE_233	28	"""Depriving the civilian population of essential health and agricultural products would only multiply the death toll of this war,"" they wrote in a statement."
DE_233	29	Food wholesaler Metro, which generates 240 million euros, or ten percent of its turnover, in Russia, also argues that it is supplying the Russian population.
DE_233	30	According to its own information, it mainly supplies restaurants, intermediaries and caterers - so it is questionable whether the loss of its 93 markets would jeopardize the food supply.
DE_233	31	Apart from their symbolic value, the financial consequences of German companies leaving the country would be manageable for the Russian state treasury in most cases.
DE_233	32	The sales, income and capital gains taxes of all Russian companies and individuals account for less than 10 percent of annual revenues.
DE_237	1	Despite weak sales figures, Tesla surprises with profit and is worth more than GM
DE_237	2	Tesla surprisingly returned to profit in the third quarter, sending the US electric car manufacturer's share price soaring along with good news from China.
DE_237	3	After two quarters in the red, the company posted a profit of 143 million dollars (128.6 million euros) between July and September.
DE_237	4	Analysts had expected the worst in view of the recent weak sales figures for the vehicles and had assumed a loss.
DE_237	5	Tesla's turnover in the third quarter amounted to 5.4 billion dollars.
DE_237	6	The car manufacturer's share price rose by over 20 percent in electronic after-hours trading.
DE_237	7	US investors' delight at this quarterly profit made Elon Musk's company the most valuable American car manufacturer on Thursday.
DE_237	8	Tesla shares rose by 17 percent on Wall Street to 298 dollars (268 euros), giving them a market capitalization of 53 billion dollars.
DE_237	9	The electric car manufacturer thus overtook the long-established company General Motors (GM), which has 51 billion dollars.
DE_237	10	Delivery target remains.
DE_237	11	"Investors thus also acknowledged statements by company boss Elon Musk, who expressed ""complete confidence"" that the annual delivery target of 360,000 to 400,000 new cars could still be achieved."
DE_237	12	Tesla has recently managed to significantly reduce its costs, which is why it has returned to profitability, the company announced.
DE_237	13	Tesla also announced the start of production on a trial basis at its new factory in China.
DE_237	14	"The so-called Gigafactory in Shanghai was built in just ten months and is now ""ready for production""."
DE_237	15	The factory is expected to reach an annual capacity of 500,000 cars.
DE_237	16	Tesla hopes that this will give it a significant boost in production and direct access to the dynamic Chinese market for electric vehicles.
DE_237	17	Focus on energy sector.
DE_237	18	The difficulties in meeting demand have long been a problem for the US company.
DE_237	19	Last year in particular, Tesla had to repeatedly adjust the production target it had set itself.
DE_237	20	The company is now confident that it will remain profitable throughout the second half of the year.
DE_237	21	The company also referred to other areas outside of electric car production: Tesla has needed all its resources for the Model 3 for the past two years, Musk said.
DE_237	22	Now sales of this model, which is so important for the company, have increased by 50 percent in the past quarter compared to the previous year and the pressure is easing.
DE_237	23	Tesla can therefore now focus more on the energy sector again, Musk said.
DE_237	24	The company also manufactures solar panels and electricity storage solutions.
DE_241	1	"A municipality wants to become ""energy self-sufficient"": How can Iffeldorf get rid of oil and gas?"
DE_241	2	Iffeldorf is not in a particularly good position when it comes to renewable energies.
DE_241	3	Their share of electricity and heat is only 17 and 18 percent respectively.
DE_241	4	The citizens' meeting now focused on how the municipality can get rid of oil and natural gas.
DE_241	5	Solar systems, groundwater pumps and district heating islands were discussed, as well as wind power.
DE_241	6	Iffeldorf - Around 270 people came to the citizens' meeting in the Iffeldorf community center, far more than a few days earlier in Penzberg.
DE_241	7	The main topic was the energy transition.
DE_241	8	"Mayor Hans Lang (SPD) had announced in advance that it was ""about our path to becoming an energy self-sufficient village"" based on renewable energies."
DE_241	9	In Iffeldorf, their share is currently 30 percent below the national average and 35 percent below the state average.
DE_241	10	According to Lang, the majority of energy, namely 85 percent, is used for heating and hot water in Iffeldorf.
DE_241	11	"The invited speaker was Andreas Scharli from ""Energiewende Oberland"", which aims to make the four participating districts independent of fossil fuels by 2035."
DE_241	12	He began by making it clear that this goal could not be achieved without making savings, for example with the help of building insulation or control technology.
DE_241	13	As a quick measure, Scharli recommended lowering the hot water temperature and the heating limit temperature on the boiler.
DE_241	14	"""There is a lot of potential."""
DE_241	15	Groundwater heat pumps and district solutions for local heating.
DE_241	16	Scharli also had some special advice for Iffeldorf.
DE_241	17	"Groundwater heat pumps could work well ""because the groundwater is not far away here,"" he said."
DE_241	18	The energy consultant considers a district heating network with a central heating plant like the one in Penzberg to be impractical for Iffeldorf due to the costs and high heat losses over long distances.
DE_241	19	However, Scharli believes it is conceivable to supply individual areas or residential districts, i.e. to rely on neighborhood solutions.
DE_241	20	"According to him, so-called ""cold local heating"" could be an option, in which water at a temperature of ten to twelve degrees is transported into the building via a network of pipes to a heat pump."
DE_241	21	This could also be used for cooling in summer.
DE_241	22	"Photovoltaics: ""There are still enough roofs available in Iffeldorf"" Scharli also promoted photovoltaics."
DE_241	23	"""There are still enough roofs available in Iffeldorf,"" he said and recommended taking a look at the district's solar register."
DE_241	24	According to him, solar systems on south-facing facades are also a possibility.
DE_241	25	"""It works extremely well in winter."" Perhaps there is also a corner for an open-air facility in Iffeldorf, said Scharli."
DE_241	26	Mayor Lang confirmed that an area was urgently needed.
DE_241	27	According to him, a solar park could be operated by an energy cooperative in which the population is involved.
DE_241	28	Question about wind power potential in Iffeldorf.
DE_241	29	The subsequent discussion was very lively.
DE_241	30	"For example, questions were asked about the wind power potential, which, according to Scharli's assessment, is ""not very high"", especially as it would also need an investor who ultimately wants to earn money."
DE_241	31	One Iffeldorfer recommended taking a closer look at the wind atlas because of an area near the highway.
DE_241	32	Regarding wind power, Mayor Lang explained that there is the possibility of participating in a wind turbine in another region, for example in the Allgäu, through a cooperative that is yet to be founded.
DE_241	33	"One question at the citizens' meeting was what the municipality meant by ""energy self-sufficiency""."
DE_241	34	"Scharli and Lang explained that the aim was to achieve ""balance sheet self-sufficiency""."
DE_241	35	This means that the municipality generates as much energy over the year as it consumes during this period, which is not true self-sufficiency.
DE_241	36	"Mayor has high hopes for the new ""Energy Working Group"" The mayor also addressed energy issues in his report."
DE_241	37	He reported that a PV system had been installed on the roof of the children's house, that the building yard now had an electric car and that a second one was about to be delivered. The plan is to install four e-charging points in 2023.
DE_241	38	There are also plans to offer a car for e-car sharing.
DE_241	39	In response to the suggestion that street lamps should be switched off at night, Lang said that all 250 lamps had already been converted to LED and that a good 70 percent of them could be dimmed.
DE_241	40	"He also has high hopes for the new ""Energy Working Group"", which consists of 14 people."
DE_241	41	He hopes that the working group will one day also be able to advise private individuals, especially in times when energy consultants are so busy that it is almost impossible to get an appointment.
DE_242	1	"Höhle der Löwen: Ankerkraut deal with Nestlé causes a disastrous response - ""Soul sold to the devil"""
DE_242	2	Nestlé acquires a majority stake in the Hamburg-based spice manufacturer Ankerkraut.
DE_242	3	But customers and cooperation partners are not at all enthusiastic about this.
DE_242	4	On Wednesday, the spice company Ankerkraut announced that the food group Nestlé is now the majority shareholder.
DE_242	5	"While the founders describe this move as ""a great opportunity"", the deal has largely fallen flat with most observers and fans."
DE_242	6	"On social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, many users are not happy about the ""Lion's Den"" start-up's deal."
DE_242	7	And even on the job platform LinkedIn, which is otherwise known for its predominantly positive comments, the deal has been met with unusually harsh criticism.
DE_242	8	The comments under the company's announcement post are clear.
DE_242	9	"""You have sold your soul to the devil"", ""When greed eats the brain - never ever more Ankerkraut in my kitchen"" or ""Unfortunately, I took a wrong turn and hit the wall with momentum"" are just a few of the hundreds of comments from disappointed customers."
DE_242	10	But consumers are not the only ones who are disappointed.
DE_242	11	A major cooperation partner has also made it clear in a public statement what it thinks of the news.
DE_242	12	YouTube star LeFloid, who regularly inspires several million subscribers with his videos, actually had a cooperation with Ankerkraut.
DE_242	13	But since the Nestle deal, this is now history.
DE_242	14	"On Instagram, he writes: ""Since a cooperation with Nestlé is out of the question for us, we see no other option than to end the cooperation with Ankerkraut as soon as possible."""
DE_242	15	LeFloid receives a lot of encouragement from his fans.
DE_242	16	"One user writes: ""The right decision."
DE_242	17	"Too bad about the store, but there are certainly alternatives with more backbone."" Another says: ""Hats off to this decision."
DE_242	18	"I personally think it's absolutely right and exemplary of you, especially given the 'scope' of the decision for you."" In fact, LeFloid had even launched his own spice called ""Holy Smokes"" with Ankerkraut."
DE_242	19	It is not yet known what will happen with the YouTuber's spice mix.
DE_242	20	But why do so many consumers resist the food giant Nestlé?
DE_242	21	The company gained its dubious reputation through numerous scandals.
DE_242	22	Former Nestle Chairman of the Board of Directors Peter Brabeck-Letmathe probably caused the greatest damage to the company's image in an interview in 2005.
DE_242	23	At that time, he spoke about water and explained that this raw material has a market value and is therefore not a public good.
DE_242	24	Most of the audience concluded from this that Brabeck-Letmathe did not see water as a human right.
DE_242	25	"On its website, however, the company backtracks: ""At Nestlé, we firmly believe that access to water is a fundamental human right."
DE_242	26	"We fully recognize the human right to water, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010."" Regarding the interview in question, it says: ""The interview in the video is an excerpt from a documentary from 2005 that has been taken out of context."
DE_242	27	This excerpt misrepresents the view of our Chairman Emeritus.
DE_242	28	"He has repeatedly said that all people have the right to clean water to meet their hydration and basic hygiene needs."""
DE_242	29	Nestlé is also heavily criticized for buying water rights.
DE_242	30	The problem: where Nestlé taps the water, it becomes a scarce commodity.
DE_242	31	This is a major problem in the French village of Vittel* .
DE_242	32	The groundwater level continues to fall - the villagers protest.
DE_242	33	In addition, there are further scandals involving milk powder for babies, criticism of the excessive sugar content in the products and the mountains of waste generated by Nespresso coffee capsules.
DE_242	34	So there are many reasons why consumers may decide not to buy Nestlé products.
DE_242	35	The bad reputation of the large corporation is now also becoming the undoing of the originally small start-up Ankerkraut.
DE_249	1	Study: Bitcoin environment changed massively in 2021
DE_249	2	2021 was not only characterized by extreme price movements in the crypto sector, but also by important events - including China's ban on Bitcoin mining and the introduction of Bitcoin as a means of payment in El Salvador.
DE_249	3	"In its ""Crypto Outlook 2022"", crypto service provider Bitcoin Suisse is convinced that these events will have far-reaching consequences - both this year and in the years to come."
DE_249	4	The exodus of Bitcoin miners from China has clear geopolitical implications, as Bitcoin Suisse Head of Research Markus Dapp emphasized on Friday at the presentation of the new report.
DE_249	5	After China took itself out of the game, the USA now provides over a third of the computing power for validating Bitcoin transactions.
DE_249	6	Mining activities have also increased significantly in Kazakhstan, Russia and Canada.
DE_249	7	However, an even broader diversification would certainly be desirable, admitted Dapp.
DE_249	8	Bitcoin official means of payment in first country The adoption of Bitcoin by a first country is also likely to have been of geopolitical significance.
DE_249	9	With this step, El Salvador in Central America has gone against the explicit recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Bitcoin Suisse recalls.
DE_249	10	It remains to be seen whether other countries will join in the current year.
DE_249	11	El Salvador's move has also put the spotlight on Lightning technology, which is based on the Bitcoin network and enables fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions.
DE_249	12	The inhabitants of El Salvador, 70 percent of whom have no bank account, would now have a safe and cheap way to receive vital foreign remittances.
DE_249	13	"Dapp also pointed out that criminals in El Salvador had specialized directly in robbing people as they left money transfer offices such as ""Western Union""."
DE_249	14	For the crypto expert, the positive social contribution of Bitcoin is generally underestimated in the discussion about its ESG impact.
DE_249	15	For countries with functioning banking systems such as Switzerland or Western Europe, this is likely to play less of a role, Dapp conceded.
DE_249	16	However, the low entry threshold to the Bitcoin system could change life for the 1.7 billion unbanked people worldwide.
DE_249	17	Experts put Bitcoin's energy requirements into perspective Bitcoin Suisse economists also put the accusations that cryptocurrencies are highly damaging to the environment into perspective.
DE_249	18	They consider the frequent comparisons of Bitcoin's energy consumption with that of a country such as Argentina to make little sense.
DE_249	19	According to estimates, Bitcoin consumes 188 terawatt hours (TWh) of global energy production per year, which is around 0.12 percent - less than gold production (571 TWh), computer games (214 TWh) or annual Christmas lighting (201 TWh), for example.
DE_249	20	"Ethereum faces ""open-heart surgery"" Meanwhile, the second most important cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has an important year ahead of it, as its ""smart contract"" blockchain has seen an explosion of applications in areas such as DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in the past year."
DE_249	21	"At the same time, the Ethereum ecosystem is in strong competition with fast-growing and extremely ""agile"" competitors such as Solana, Cardano and Polkadot."
DE_249	22	"Ethereum is now about to take the next technical step towards the much more complex ""Ethereum 2.0"" this year, which includes switching to the much less energy-intensive ""Proof of Stake"" process."
DE_249	23	"The complex undertaking is like ""open heart surgery"", said Dapp - the chances of success are around 50:50."
DE_249	24	"Meanwhile, Ethereum's competitors are not sleeping: ""If there are delays, the competition will continue to grow."""
DE_254	1	The transformation of Bitcoin - We are living through a monetary revolution - and Bitcoin is on the road to victory
DE_254	2	One should be careful with these words - too often they have been punished dearly on the stock market.
DE_254	3	But with Bitcoin, everything could really be different this time.
DE_254	4	Because something has fundamentally changed.
DE_254	5	During the first Bitcoin hype, the dream was that the cryptocurrency really could one day replace the euro.
DE_254	6	There were also many small private investors in the market.
DE_254	7	"But this time, investing in Bitcoin is about something else: ""We are living through a currency revolution so multifaceted that few of us realize its full extent,"" wrote economic historian Niall Ferguson in a recent guest article."
DE_254	8	"""The technological transformation of the Internet is driving this revolution."
DE_254	9	"The 2020 pandemic has accelerated it."""
DE_254	10	Bitcoin has more than doubled in 2020 - and the prospects for a further rise are good.
DE_254	11	Find out from Bitcoin expert Jörg Hermsdorf on December 8 what the drivers of the rally are and how best to invest in Bitcoin.
DE_254	12	Click HERE to register!
DE_254	13	In view of the growing money supply, investors are trying to protect their assets against possible inflation.
DE_254	14	Distrust of paper currencies is growing.
DE_254	15	In the past, money flowed into real estate, shares and gold during such phases.
DE_254	16	It is doing so again - only now some of the assets are also going into Bitcoin.
DE_254	17	"""This rally is being driven by smart and institutional money and is not built on speculation alone,"" said Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at eToro."
DE_254	18	"""Many individuals and asset managers are now buying in."""
DE_254	19	Bitcoin could take the place of gold.
DE_254	20	Bitcoin is also scarce and cannot be multiplied at will - two fundamental characteristics that asset protection needs.
DE_254	21	Bitcoin offers built-in scarcity in a virtual world characterized by limitless abundance.
DE_254	22	"""Do I believe that bitcoin is a permanent fixture that could largely take the place of gold?"
DE_254	23	"Yes, I do, because it's so much more functional than passing around a gold bar,"" said Rick Rieder, chief fixed income strategist at Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, recently."
DE_254	24	"If this thesis proves true, then the rise of Bitcoin is far from over: ""If the world's millionaires shift just one percent of their assets into Bitcoin, the price will rise to 75,000 dollars,"" calculates Ferguson in his guest article."
DE_254	25	"""It may even rise higher if you consider that many bitcoins have disappeared."" However, it is also clear that the further establishment of Bitcoin will not be a one-way street."
DE_254	26	There will be setbacks and bumpy passages.
DE_254	27	It is therefore important to invest with caution and prudence.
DE_254	28	Because even if many things change, some things remain the same.
DE_255	1	Surveillance with Apple Airtags: Apple, listen to the signals
DE_255	2	Data protectionists can warn about security gaps as often as they like.
DE_255	3	They are rarely heard by the companies.
DE_255	4	Airtags are designed to make the annoying search for or loss of keys or wallets a thing of the past Privacy advocates like Lothar Wieler and Christian Drosten have been feeling the same way for years.
DE_255	5	They warn, repeat themselves, provide evidence for their warnings and repeat themselves.
DE_255	6	And when case XY occurs, nobody wants to have known anything about it.
DE_255	7	The story of the new Airtags added to the Apple range in the summer can be summarized in a similar way.
DE_255	8	Stories of misuse are now piling up.
DE_255	9	The airtags, which are about the size of a 2-euro coin, are designed to make searching for or losing keys or wallets a thing of the past.
DE_255	10	The standard version of the Apple Airtag costs 35 euros.
DE_255	11	Apple has also thought of design lovers: Airtags are available in the exclusive Hermès version, from 300 euros upwards.
DE_255	12	The waterproof air tag contains a U1 chip with ultra-wideband technology that can be tracked via Bluetooth.
DE_255	13	Apple has of course not invented a new product with this; location tags have been around for a long time from various companies.
DE_255	14	Apple has improved the proximity search in particular to get an even more precise location.
DE_255	15	In addition, owners can now send a message to potential finders.
DE_255	16	Basically, all locating tags work according to the same principle: at regular intervals, they send out an identifier via Bluetooth that can be used to identify them.
DE_255	17	If a nearby smartphone receives the transmission, it links the data with its own current position and forwards it to the manufacturer.
DE_255	18	"And now comes the Apple twist: While other manufacturers rely on as many users as possible downloading their app in order to get enough data, Apple has integrated the function directly into iOS: Every Apple mobile device that has the ""Where is?"
DE_255	19	""" app forwards the airtags to Apple."
DE_255	20	This function is activated by default on all Apple mobile devices.
DE_255	21	Instructions for espionage.
DE_255	22	Apple asserted that it had considered everything when it came to data protection.
DE_255	23	There are now videos on Tiktok in which people discover foreign airtags on their cars, for example.
DE_255	24	Others explain how best to use the tags for spying - from a quick microphone removal to the perfect hiding place.
DE_255	25	Although the tags constantly change their Bluetooth Mac address and encrypt their data, only the owner can then identify them.
DE_255	26	It is practically impossible to identify the perpetrators.
DE_255	27	A warning signal, which is intended to draw attention to secret tracking, only sounds when the tag has been out of reach of its owner for three days.
DE_255	28	However, if the airtag reappears in the vicinity of its owner, the warning does not appear.
DE_255	29	The warning signals to Apple did not fail to materialize back then, and now they are getting louder again.
DE_255	30	Perhaps the company is simply trying to ride out the second wave of outrage.
DE_268	1	Can the coronavirus be eradicated?
DE_268	2	Researchers present mathematical model
DE_268	3	Theoretically, the global eradication of Covid-19 would be possible, as the study in the journal BMJ Global Health states
DE_268	4	According to the researchers, eradicating Covid-19 would be even easier than eradicating polio, but more difficult than eradicating smallpox.
DE_268	5	Success depends on various factors - technical, socio-political and economic.
DE_268	6	Eradicating Covid-19 - researchers answer this important question.
DE_268	7	"""The analysis shows that the eradication of Covid-19 is within the realms of technical feasibility,"" said Professor Nick Wilson from the University of Otago and author of the study in a press release."
DE_268	8	In his opinion, the combination of vaccination programs, public health measures and global interest in combating the disease are helping to make eradication possible.
DE_268	9	The scientists used a complex mathematical model to evaluate the eradication of three diseases - Covid-19, polio and smallpox. 17 variables - including the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, the possibility of lifelong immunity, public health measures and infection control - were taken into account in the model.
DE_268	10	Smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, received the highest average score for the feasibility of eradication, according to the scientists.
DE_268	11	On a three-point scale with the 17 variables, smallpox was rated with an average of 2.7.
DE_268	12	In comparison, Covid-19 had an average score of 1.6 and polio an average score of 1.5.
DE_268	13	Coronavirus: eradication of Covid-19 possible according to researchers
DE_268	14	Vaccination programs were largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox, the researchers explain.
DE_268	15	In the case of Covid-19, a combination of vaccination programs, public health measures and global interest in combating the disease could help to eradicate the coronavirus.
DE_268	16	"Some parts of the world - New Zealand, for example - have been ""corona-free"" for a long period of time without vaccinations."
DE_268	17	According to Wilson, this already points to a technical possibility of eradicating Covid-19 worldwide.
DE_268	18	In order to defeat Covid-19, Prof.
DE_268	19	Wilson to rely on so-called ring vaccination programs, as in the fight against smallpox.
DE_268	20	These programs were aimed primarily at the contact persons of the infected persons and thus ensured the eradication of smallpox.
DE_268	21	Herd immunity was therefore not necessary.
DE_268	22	According to the scientists, the biggest challenges would be to achieve a high vaccination coverage rate against Sars-CoV2 and to adapt the vaccine to the corona mutations.
DE_268	23	According to the researchers, the acceptance of the coronavirus vaccine is low compared to smallpox and polio.
DE_268	24	A vaccination quota necessary for eradication would fail in many rich countries due to vaccination refusals.
DE_268	25	In poorer countries, on the other hand, there are still too few vaccines to achieve the necessary vaccination rates.
DE_268	26	"The scientists are calling for close international cooperation in the face of ""vaccine nationalism"" and ""anti-science movements""."
DE_268	27	Wilson and his team point out that their analysis still needs to be peer-reviewed.
DE_268	28	An investigation into the benefits and costs of eradicating Covid-19 is also necessary.
DE_268	29	Moreover, it is important to distinguish between eradicating a disease and reducing the infection rate in a particular geographical region.
DE_268	30	Polio and smallpox.
DE_268	31	Polio - poliomyelitis - polio.
DE_268	32	There have been no cases of polio (infantile paralysis) in Germany for many years.
DE_268	33	But the virus has still not been eradicated.
DE_268	34	There is still a risk of contracting polio abroad.
DE_268	35	Vaccination against polio is therefore important.
DE_268	36	Smallpox - leaf blisters, called Variola major, Variola vera or smallpox.
DE_268	37	Smallpox has been officially eradicated since the 1980s.
DE_268	38	Global vaccination programs have been terminated.
DE_268	39	Only two WHO reference laboratories in the USA and Russia still have smallpox strains, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).
DE_268	40	For centuries there were repeated outbreaks of smallpox, and in the 18th century, the disease was spread to the whole country.
DE_268	41	In the 20th century, 400,000 people in Europe died from it every year.
DE_273	1	Denmark | Elections in Denmark: Narrow majority for left-wing alliance
DE_273	2	The left-wing alliance around Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's Social Democrats has won the parliamentary elections.
DE_273	3	According to the final result published on Wednesday night, Frederiksen's red bloc won a total of 90 out of 179 seats in the Danish parliament - and thus a narrow government majority.
DE_273	4	After the result was announced, Frederiksen announced the formal resignation of her government and coalition negotiations for a broad coalition for Wednesday. Frederiksen's red bloc won 87 seats, plus three seats in Greenland and on the Faroe Islands.
DE_273	5	The alliance of liberals, conservatives and right-wing populists, known as the blue bloc, won a total of 73 seats in the elections.
DE_273	6	Former Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen's Moderate Party enters parliament for the first time with 16 MPs.
DE_273	7	Frederiksen's Social Democrats are the clear winners of the election: 27.5 percent of voters voted for the party, giving it 50 seats in the parliament in Copenhagen.
DE_273	8	Compared to the 2019 election, the party gained 1.6 percentage points.
DE_273	9	Opinion polls, on the other hand, had pointed to a historically poor result for the Social Democrats, while the post-election surveys published on Tuesday evening suggested that neither of the two blocs had achieved a majority.
DE_273	10	On Wednesday, Prime Minister Frederiksen spoke of the Social Democrats' best result for over 20 years and held out the prospect of coalition negotiations starting soon.
DE_273	11	"When the Social Democrats say something, we stick to it,"" said the 44-year-old, referring to her proposal during the election campaign to lead a cross-party government alliance."
DE_273	12	The Social Democrats are a party for the whole of Denmark.
DE_273	13	In addition to the fight against inflation, the main topics in the election campaign were climate issues and healthcare policy.
DE_273	14	On Sunday, around 50,000 people, including Frederiksen, took part in a climate march through Copenhagen.
DE_273	15	Immigration did not play a role; in the EU country, there has been cross-party agreement on a restrictive immigration policy for a good 20 years.
DE_273	16	Frederiksen has embodied the new course of the Danish Social Democrats since taking office as head of government.
DE_273	17	The party combines a restrictive immigration policy with the promise to protect the welfare state.
DE_273	18	Frederiksen's overall management of the country during the coronavirus pandemic was praised, but the 44-year-old prime minister has been dogged by the mink scandal for some time: in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, her government ordered the killing of all 15 million farmed mink in the country in November 2020.
DE_273	19	The aim was to prevent the spread of a mutated form of Sars-CoV-2 that could be transmitted to humans and was feared to impair the effectiveness of future vaccines.
DE_273	20	As it turned out later, there was no legal basis for the measure; it was only created after the fact.
DE_273	21	Both left-wing and right-wing parties then called for new elections.
DE_273	22	The next parliamentary elections were not actually due to take place until June 2023.
DE_279	1	"PNP interview: Hofreiter: ""Shameful that politics is failing in climate protection"""
DE_279	2	"Anton Hofreiter, parliamentary party leader of the Greens, criticizes the German government's environmental policy as ""shameful"" in an interview with the PNP."
DE_279	3	"""It is shameful that politicians are failing to protect the climate and are not taking the necessary measures to ensure that young people have a secure future,"" says Hofreiter about the ""Fridays for Future"" movement, in which tens of thousands of schoolchildren demonstrate week after week for climate protection."
DE_279	4	It is telling that pupils now have to fight to ensure that their own livelihoods are not destroyed.
DE_279	5	"When young people's commitment and protests for their own future ""are then criticized and dismissed by politicians, as the FDP does, I lack any understanding for it"". ""50,000 e-cars - that's an indictment of poverty"" Hofreiter has a bad opinion of the ""Concerted Action on Mobility"" planned by the coalition committee."
DE_279	6	"Above all, ""more meetings with the bosses of the automotive industry are planned."
DE_279	7	"This has little to do with a ""concerted action on mobility"","" the Green politician pointed out, noting that the Federal Minister of Transport had met the car bosses 15 times last year, but not at all with the environmental associations."
DE_279	8	"""This clearly shows that there is a need to catch up on climate and environmental protection, not the corporate bosses."""
DE_279	9	"The Merkel government had set the target of putting one million electric cars on the roads by 2020, Hofreiter recalled, referring to the intentions to promote e-mobility. ""In 2019, we are only at 50,000."
DE_279	10	"That is an indictment."""
DE_279	11	"On the climate cabinet: ""You don't need a working group"" On the climate cabinet that the coalition committee wants to set up, Hofreiter said: ""Nobody would be happier than me if the federal government finally protected the climate."
DE_279	12	But the Grand Coalition works according to the motto, if you don't know what to do, set up a working group.
DE_279	13	In order to make progress on climate protection, the expansion of renewable energies must be driven forward again.
DE_279	14	"""Wind power slumped by half last year."
DE_279	15	Something has to happen here.
DE_279	16	"You don't need a working group for that."""
DE_279	17	"""The Bavarian state government has systematically ensured that the Free State is left behind when it comes to wind power"" According to Hofreiter, the fact that consumers have to pay such high electricity prices is due to the exemptions and subsidies for the industry."
DE_279	18	He believes that another reason why cheap wind power, for example, is not reaching Bavaria is the Bavarian state government, which has long delayed and blocked the expansion of power lines and the grid.
DE_279	19	"Hofreiter complains: ""The state government has systematically ensured that the Free State is being left behind here."
DE_279	20	"It sabotaged the expansion of wind power and fought against every single wind turbine that the municipalities wanted to build."""
DE_285	1	The next president: How Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump
DE_285	2	It is not known how many of the 3,500 court cases that Donald Trump has conducted directly or indirectly during his lifetime have ended favorably for him.
DE_285	3	As far as the legal rearguard action with which America's president wants to turn the defeat around five minutes after 12 is concerned, a preliminary figure has already been set: towards zero.
DE_285	4	All attempts by the Trump campaign to have the election results qualified as fraudulent by the competent courts of the states concerned have so far failed.
DE_285	5	In Michigan, Trump wanted to stop the counting of ballots until his own election observers were allowed to supervise the procedure - judges rejected this as unfounded.
DE_285	6	Moreover, the result was already clear: Biden.
DE_285	7	In Wisconsin, Trump claimed voting was hindered by queues and faulty voting machines and demanded a recount - rejected.
DE_285	8	In Georgia, Trump cited a poll worker who claimed to have observed that 53 ballots arrived late and were counted - rejected.
DE_285	9	"Because ""hearsay"", according to the judge."
DE_285	10	In Nevada, Trump's former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, went on the record and announced a lawsuit because several thousand people had allegedly voted illegally.
DE_285	11	Asked by journalists for evidence, Grenell fled into a bus.
DE_285	12	Later, state election officials declared that it is legitimate to vote in Nevada even if you don't live there.
DE_285	13	In Detroit, Trump filed a lawsuit because Republican election observers had been denied access during the count - in the judicial hearing, it embarrassingly turned out that 100 observers from both parties were present.
DE_285	14	The judge rolls his eyes.
DE_285	15	"Renowned constitutional lawyers make it clear on US television that Trump has so far only made allegations garnished with imprecise terms such as ""irregularities"" and ""lack of transparency"", which no court will be impressed by."
DE_285	16	On the contrary.
DE_285	17	"The more often Trump talks about a ""stolen"" election, the less judges would ""take it seriously"", said law professor Jonathan Turley, who is sympathetic to Trump."
DE_285	18	"Ben Ginsberg, who spent many years as a lawyer for the Republicans, speaks of ""Hail Mary"" lawsuits, in reference to a play in American football that is supposed to turn around a game that is already as good as lost at the last minute."
DE_285	19	As recently as Friday, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ruled that absentee ballots received by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania could not be used.
DE_285	20	The votes received before 8 p.m. on November 3 and bearing the postmark 3.11. must be counted and stored separately.
DE_285	21	But: Alito deliberately rejected the Trump camp's demand to declare these votes invalid now.
DE_285	22	Local election officials signaled that the order of the highest court would not have any major consequences.
DE_285	23	Timothy O'Brien, once Trump's biographer and (unsuccessfully) sued by the New York businessman in 2006, sees Trump's legal smokescreens as an attempt to knit a stab-in-the-back legend.
DE_285	24	"This is intended to suppress the ""loser image"" (the first president in almost 30 years not to get a second term in office) in the public eye."
DE_285	25	Hundreds of Trump fans have already bitten the bullet and are demonstrating for their president.
DE_285	26	According to O'Brien, America can expect a long-term Trump narrative that starts something like this: If I hadn't been cheated in the 2020 election...
DE_295	1	"Culture ""Verbal artillery"": Andrij Melnyk defends his PR tactics"
DE_295	2	He is once again present on all channels, which is highly remarkable for a Deputy Foreign Minister.
DE_295	3	But Andrij Melnyk (47), Ukraine's ambassador to Germany until October last year, apparently enjoys public attention more than almost any other diplomat and even welcomes criticism.
DE_295	4	"The ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"", for example, wrote about him under the commentary heading ""Noise instead of debate"" that he had strongly influenced German Russia policy with his demands ""from the outside"": ""The former Ukrainian ambassador was a master at this, he once blamed Germany for many deaths in his country due to a lack of arms deliveries."""
DE_295	5	"""They think that's it"" Melnyk tweeted his thanks for this editorial, which he described as a ""compliment"", and replied: ""Without this noise, there would never have been a debate about arms deliveries in Germany."""
DE_295	6	At the same time, he tried to put further pressure on Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
DE_295	7	"The Germans ""leaned back too soon"", the diplomat said in a recent interview with the Ukrainian portal NV: ""They think, well, that's it, it was a difficult birth, to put it that way, it took more than nine months, these tank births took almost a year, and now it turns out that you can breathe out, relax and put your feet up, we shouldn't expect anything else."""
DE_295	8	"However, this was ""wrong"", said Melnyk, adding that Ukraine could expect ""larger quantities"" of weapons from Germany: ""I know that they are available."""
DE_295	9	"In a tweet, the Deputy Foreign Minister assured that he was not constantly demanding more weapons from his allies ""just for fun"", but was determined to initiate debates, even if he did not achieve his goals ""tomorrow"" and was sometimes subjected to scorn and ridicule."
DE_295	10	"In a further interview with the public television station in Ukraine, Melnyk now explained in detail why he is so present in the media: ""This is a forced step."
DE_295	11	We are all well-mannered, polite and no one has given up on classic diplomacy.
DE_295	12	But the war came to our country.
DE_295	13	Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world.
DE_295	14	A country that is one of the top 5 arms exporters.
DE_295	15	The Germans exported weapons worth nine billion euros in the year before the war.
DE_295	16	"Then they tell us that they can supply 5,000 helmets, and that's after long discussions."""
DE_295	17	"""It was a cry for help"" He is ""not sure"" whether he will maintain his sometimes polemical style of communication."
DE_295	18	"He described his tweets as an ""experiment that was and is fraught with risk""."
DE_295	19	"He is fully aware that he has outraged some people in Germany, but the results are more important than taking this into account: ""In this situation, it seemed less risky to go on the offensive."""
DE_295	20	"The ex-ambassador compared himself to a drowning man searching for a lifebuoy: ""I regret and regret that I had to use such heavy verbal artillery, but in hindsight it was the only possible method."
DE_295	21	The point is not that any politician there might feel attacked, but that German society understands: If the Ukrainians are using such methods, then the situation there is pretty bad.
DE_295	22	"It was a cry for help,"" says Melnyk."
DE_295	23	"""They call it coordination"" In peacetime, an ambassador usually has no access to Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz."
DE_295	24	The usual official business would be handled at the level of state secretaries.
DE_295	25	"This made his Twitter messages all the more important: ""I knew that every message I sent would be read by Scholz's office manager within a second."
DE_295	26	This is [Chancellery Minister] Wolfgang Schmidt.
DE_295	27	"I know he won't like it, that he'll probably let out a few quiet or even loud curses, but I also know that the message will arrive in a matter of seconds and within an hour someone will comment on it and there will already be a discussion."""
DE_295	28	Incidentally, Melnyk says that he is currently no longer responsible for Germany, but for Latin America, the USA and Canada.
DE_295	29	"But even in this role, he wants to influence political Berlin, because Germany often orients itself towards allies: ""They call it coordination."
DE_295	30	"This means that we can use these levers both via Latin America and via the United States to promote some processes in Europe."""
DE_295	31	"""Russia must be de-Nazified"" Asked how he envisioned a ""victory"" for Ukraine, Melnyk replied: ""Russia must go through what the Germans went through on 8 September."
DE_295	32	May 1945.
DE_295	33	Not only complete and unconditional surrender without [prior] negotiations, because nobody negotiated with Hitler either, although he had tried in the last few months.
DE_295	34	But what happened after that?
DE_295	35	"Germany was occupied by the Allies and there was a process of so-called denazification, which the Russians wanted to carry out in our country."""
DE_299	1	Mega deal officially announced - Bayern make Nagelsmann world record coach!
DE_299	2	Officially confirmed!
DE_299	3	Bayern brings in Nagelsmann.
DE_299	4	The coach and the record champions had previously agreed on a five-year contract.
DE_299	5	"President Herbert Hainer (66) in Bayern's official statement: ""Julian Nagelsmann represents a new generation of coaches."
DE_299	6	Despite his young age, he already has an impressive career to his name.
DE_299	7	"We are convinced that with Julian Nagelsmann we will build on the great successes of recent years."""
DE_299	8	And the departure of coach Hansi Flick has also been completed as he wished.
DE_299	9	According to information from BILD and SPORT BILD, he will succeed Jogi Löw (61) as national coach after the European Championship in the summer.
DE_299	10	"Hainer: ""I would like to expressly thank Hansi Flick on behalf of FC Bayern."
DE_299	11	He took over our team in 2019 during a difficult phase and went on to win six titles, with a seventh hopefully coming soon.
DE_299	12	He will always have a place in the FC Bayern history books.
DE_299	13	"We wish him all the best for the future."""
DE_299	14	Also historic: Nagelsmann's move to Bayern makes him the most expensive coaching appointment in soccer history!
DE_299	15	Bayern are transferring a sum in the double-digit millions to Leipzig, which could rise to up to 25 million euros including bonuses.
DE_299	16	"Bayern board member Oliver Kahn (51), who takes over the chairmanship from Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (65) at the end of the year: ""Julian's contract term of five years alone shows how much he identifies with FC Bayern."
DE_299	17	"I am convinced that we will shape the sporting future of FC Bayern very successfully together with Julian Nagelsmann."""
DE_299	18	"He continued: ""My thanks go to Hansi Flick."
DE_299	19	He has led FC Bayern to great successes with great soccer.
DE_299	20	We have now fulfilled his wish to leave FC Bayern before the end of his contract.
DE_299	21	All the best, Hansi!
DE_299	22	""" And sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic (44), whose internal friction with Flick was one of the main reasons for the coach's wish to leave, also had his say in the announcement about his successor."
DE_299	23	"Salihamidzic: ""The talks with Julian were very cooperative, very constructive."
DE_299	24	"I am convinced that we will have a lot of fun with him."" And on Flick: ""I would like to thank Hansi Flick very much."
DE_299	25	After he took over as head coach just over a year and a half ago, we have celebrated numerous victories and titles, with the treble in 2020 being the highlight.
DE_299	26	These successes will remain associated with his name.
DE_299	27	"I wish him all the best for the future."" Flick himself also expressed his thanks in the statement."
DE_299	28	"""The past two years will remain unforgettable for me."
DE_299	29	"I really enjoyed the emotions, the victories, the titles, but also the daily work on the pitch - it was an outstanding time."""
DE_299	30	"And further: ""You can only be successful together!"
DE_299	31	A coach is nothing without his team and I was lucky enough to meet fantastic players here in Munich and a staff and coaching team that did an incredible job.
DE_299	32	Thanks guys, thanks Kathleen!
DE_299	33	"Special thanks also go to President Herbert Hainer, as well as the entire board around Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidzic, for giving me the opportunity to coach this great team."" And to the fans, he added: ""There is still one fly in the ointment: We weren't able to celebrate the greatest successes during this time with the fans."
DE_299	34	I missed them in every game.
DE_299	35	I wish the FC Bayern family only the very best for the future.
DE_299	36	"It's no empty phrase when I say: 'It was a great honor for me'."" Now the next Bayern chapter will begin next season under Nagelsmann ..."
DE_301	1	Golden times for employees?
DE_301	2	Whether around Hamburg, Halle, Stuttgart or Cologne, it's not just individual trains that are being canceled with increasing frequency, but entire train lines and S-Bahn routes.
DE_301	3	"Sometimes for days, according to announcements on the platform ""due to short-term illness of staff"" - even long after the corona waves have subsided."
DE_301	4	Sickness can often no longer be compensated for, especially in signal boxes and control centers.
DE_301	5	The employees have already worked countless hours of overtime.
DE_301	6	Staffing levels are tight.
DE_301	7	Employers must entice with benefits.
DE_301	8	Because traffic has been increasing for years, Deutsche Bahn actually needs additional staff.
DE_301	9	It also hires far more than 20,000 new people every year.
DE_301	10	But almost as many leave the company.
DE_301	11	Not just into retirement, as the Chairman of the DB-Regio Works Council reports.
DE_301	12	"According to Ralf Damde, they are ""leaving DB for new jobs in the catering trade, at discount stores and in all kinds of other sectors, where you can now often earn even better with more regular working hours""."
DE_301	13	Turning your back on a crisis-proof job without fear of unemployment?
DE_301	14	Unthinkable in the past, hardly a problem today.
DE_301	15	On the contrary.
DE_301	16	There are naturally limits to wage demands.
DE_301	17	But many employers have to entice employees with other benefits: company childcare, flexible working hours, working from home or affordable housing.
DE_301	18	All sectors, all qualifications.
DE_301	19	Headhunter Marcus Reinhard used to mainly look for highly paid specialists for management positions.
DE_301	20	Today, he searches for even simple unskilled workers in practically all sectors.
DE_301	21	He is currently looking for professional drivers for a family business with special vehicles for the semi-automatic cleaning of waste garbage cans.
DE_301	22	There are regular working hours, more pay than is usual for truck drivers and even continued payment of wages if the machines and their drivers are unable to work in winter when it freezes.
DE_301	23	Nevertheless, the expensive trucks are often at a standstill due to a shortage of labor, existing orders cannot be processed and can no longer be accepted.
DE_301	24	According to Enzo Weber from the Institute for Employment Research, this is just the beginning.
DE_301	25	The baby boomers are gradually retiring, and by 2035 there will be around seven million fewer workers in Germany.
DE_301	26	With a shrinking population, jobs are being lost in the service sector in particular, but the shrinkage will not only hit companies hard.
DE_301	27	"""If we look at how our economy has actually grown so far, growth has been through employment expansion, and that can no longer be the strategy,"" says Weber."
DE_301	28	Language competence takes time.
DE_301	29	The German government wants to attract workers from non-EU countries through better integration and faster naturalization.
DE_301	30	In professions that require a high level of language competence, however, this can only have a long-term effect.
DE_301	31	And: Skilled workers must also feel welcome in Germany, they must find a place to live.
DE_301	32	Headhunter Reinhard, for example, knows of the case of a computer specialist who fled from Iran and was presented with a 300-page employment contract by an employer - a barely legible amount of paper.
DE_301	33	Thanks to Reinhard's mediation, he now works in a medium-sized company that presented him with an employment contract of just three pages.
DE_301	34	Targeted further training at an advanced age.
DE_301	35	The headhunter also refers to other methods.
DE_301	36	Older employees, who are hardly supported by some employers shortly before retirement, often really blossomed after a job change with new tasks and held out until retirement.
DE_301	37	Women who may have worked in an office or part-time while raising children could often take on higher-skilled and better-paid jobs at an older age through targeted further training.
DE_301	38	"Expert Weber also considers both areas to be crucial: ""If someone installs a combustion engine but loses their job due to the switch to electric vehicles, then they also have enough qualifications to install heat pumps or solar systems."""
DE_301	39	A short training course of a few months is often sufficient.
DE_301	40	However, our education system and the practice of job advertisements are not designed for this.
DE_301	41	Germany must exploit all potential - to promote immigration and integration as well as full-time employment for women and to activate older workers before they retire.
DE_M_007	1	Economic and innovation policy for Germany
DE_M_007	2	The AfD stands for a market-based economic policy: the protection of property, freedom of contract, the unity of action and liability, freedom of occupation and a competitive economic order are elementary components of a free and prosperous civil society.
DE_M_007	3	We want to preserve these and correct undesirable developments.
DE_M_007	4	In recent years, the conditions for increasing prosperity have deteriorated.
DE_M_007	5	The global economy has lost momentum.
DE_M_007	6	"Politically initiated upheavals such as the ""climate rescue"" require enormous investments and restructuring and hit some sectors hard."
DE_M_007	7	This weakens the core of the German economy.
DE_M_007	8	At the same time, according to a study by the European Central Bank, Germany ranks at the bottom of various prosperity indicators in Europe.
DE_M_007	9	In this situation, the coronavirus pandemic largely paralyzes the international economy for a time and leads to a dramatic decline in value creation.
DE_M_007	10	The German economy is export-oriented and dependent on the international division of labor.
DE_M_007	11	That is why our country is particularly affected by the global impact of the coronavirus crisis.
DE_M_007	12	The AfD therefore wants to return the economy to a normal development path.
DE_M_007	13	Relieving the burden on SMEs
DE_M_007	14	German SMEs not only provide the majority of jobs, they also form an anchor of stability for our economic structure with their flexibility and inventiveness.
DE_M_007	15	It often achieves this without state subsidies and tax breaks, from which large corporations in particular benefit.
DE_M_007	16	However, it cannot cope with the double burden of politically initiated structural breaks and pandemic-related restrictions.
DE_M_007	17	"Bailout packages worth trillions cannot replace a recovery of the real economy or bring it about overnight; instead, they will only promote redistribution in the spirit of the ""Great Transformation"" and to the detriment of our competitiveness on the global market."
DE_M_007	18	Suspend politically induced burdens
DE_M_007	19	We want to completely free the economy from politically induced burdens.
DE_M_007	20	To this end, we also want to adapt the legal situation where necessary.
DE_M_007	21	Irrespective of this, we are campaigning at national level for compensation for the economic sectors affected by
DE_M_007	22	are particularly affected by the coronavirus measures.
DE_M_007	23	"Technology leadership with ""Blue Deal"""
DE_M_007	24	The German inventive spirit is legendary.
DE_M_007	25	Today, however, inventors are mobile and often emigrate, as they are subject to restrictions here and do not find the development support and financial backers that promote the establishment of a company.
DE_M_007	26	We must reverse this trend.
DE_M_007	27	We want to unleash investment in technology leadership with a blue deal development plan by:
DE_M_007	28	Focus school education, higher education and research more strongly on STEM subjects,
DE_M_007	29	promote the translation of scientific findings into products, encourage independence and inventiveness and thus utilize the dynamics of small innovative units.
DE_M_007	30	We see technological and economic opportunities for the future, for example
DE_M_007	31	in the reconstruction of a national pharmaceutical-medical competence cluster,
DE_M_007	32	in drawing up and implementing a quantum computing development plan,
DE_M_007	33	in the development of technologies and business models for space utilization.
DE_M_007	34	To this end, we want to improve the framework conditions for domestic investment,
DE_M_007	35	bring the infrastructure up to a modern standard, end state intervention in the energy market so that Germany remains internationally competitive as a business location.
DE_M_007	36	We want to reduce bureaucracy and make the state more efficient by streamlining labour law and making it more flexible, ending the discrimination of SMEs compared to large multinational corporations, ensuring a reliable legal and regulatory framework, reviewing and, if necessary, amending labour law.
DE_M_007	37	Dismantling resp.
DE_M_007	38	Limitation of regulations and subsidies, review and reduction of economically relevant areas of law with regard to their susceptibility to disputes.
DE_M_007	39	"Social market economy instead of socialist ""industrial policy"""
DE_M_007	40	Our understanding of a social market economy includes a prosperous cooperation between entrepreneurs and employees.
DE_M_007	41	They are not opponents, but cooperate in the spirit of social partnership in order to achieve company goals and balance conflicting interests.
DE_M_007	42	As the AfD, we are committed to the participation and co-determination of employees in companies and to generally binding collective agreements.
DE_M_007	43	In contrast, we firmly reject demands for expropriation, the abolition of private property and freedom of contract, inflammatory class war rhetoric or deliberately induced conflicts by representatives of left-wing parties.
DE_M_007	44	They jeopardize social peace and cooperation based on trust.
DE_M_008	1	Courage to perform instead of academization mania
DE_M_008	2	A performance-oriented, differentiated education system is the basis of our prosperity and an essential part of our culture.
DE_M_008	3	However, while the proportion of high school graduates has been rising steadily for decades, trainees and first-year students lack basic knowledge and skills.
DE_M_008	4	Since the PISA shock 20 years ago, one reform has followed the next, with a constant lowering of standards.
DE_M_008	5	The educational standards of all types of schools and educational institutions must be raised to the level of a leading scientific and industrial nation.
DE_M_008	6	We are calling for a move away from an exclusive focus on skills and a stronger academic orientation of teaching.
DE_M_008	7	Maintaining the multi-tier school system
DE_M_008	8	Educational equity requires differentiation, not egalitarianism.
DE_M_008	9	Efficient teaching and learning is only possible if the differences in performance between pupils within a school type remain limited.
DE_M_008	10	We therefore advocate a differentiated but permeable school system that does justice to the different talents of pupils.
DE_M_008	11	The Abitur must once again become a certificate of eligibility to study, and the Hauptschule or Realschule certificate must qualify students for qualified vocational training.
DE_M_008	12	Independent schools
DE_M_008	13	Strengthening vocational training: Master craftsman instead of master
DE_M_008	14	Dual training in companies and vocational schools is a successful model.
DE_M_008	15	However, the pursuit of ever higher rates of school-leavers with a university entrance qualification is jeopardizing the next generation of trainees in the training professions.
DE_M_008	16	Numerous apprenticeship positions cannot be filled due to a lack of sufficiently qualified applicants.
DE_M_008	17	We want to strengthen the vocational education and training system.
DE_M_008	18	The value of vocational training must be emphasized more strongly.
DE_M_008	19	Digitization is not an end in itself
DE_M_008	20	Schools always need modern, up-to-date IT equipment.
DE_M_008	21	This is particularly necessary for computer science lessons and for vocational training in technical subjects.
DE_M_008	22	However, digitalization must always be viewed under the premises of meaningfulness and making work easier.
DE_M_008	23	To this end, binding criteria for framework curricula and internal school curricula must be defined as to how digital media can be used within the teaching-learning process in a didactically methodical and age-appropriate manner and in compliance with data protection regulations.
DE_M_008	24	The first four years of school should be predominantly digital-free spaces, as they serve to acquire the basic cultural techniques of reading, arithmetic and writing.
DE_M_008	25	No ideologically motivated inclusion: maintain special needs and special schools
DE_M_008	26	The United Nations' demand to guarantee disabled children participation in the education system has already been met in Germany.
DE_M_008	27	Children with special needs receive comprehensive support at special schools that mainstream schools cannot provide.
DE_M_008	28	The AfD is therefore committed to the preservation of special schools.
DE_M_008	29	Special schools must once again become the norm for pupils with special educational needs.
DE_M_008	30	Education and migration
DE_M_008	31	The integration of migrants is a challenge for the German education system, as many of them come from other cultural backgrounds and often from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.
DE_M_008	32	In many cases, a lack of previous education and language skills prevent successful qualification for the German labor market.
DE_M_008	33	These people are at risk of failing personally in Germany and becoming a permanent burden on the welfare state.
DE_M_008	34	The AfD is urging that the level of education be taken into account as a key decision-making criterion in any future rationally managed immigration policy.
DE_M_008	35	The experience gained in Japan can be groundbreaking in this respect.
DE_M_008	36	The aim of schooling for school-age asylum seekers must be to prepare them for the possibility of returning to their home country.
DE_M_008	37	The learning progress of local pupils must not be
DE_M_008	38	be impaired.
DE_M_008	39	As long as the migrants do not speak enough German to take part in regular lessons, lessons in their mother tongue are an option.
DE_M_008	40	Restoring the neutrality of the school
DE_M_008	41	The classroom must not be a place of political indoctrination.
DE_M_008	42	German schools often do not promote the formation of an independent opinion, but rather the uncritical adoption of ideological guidelines.
DE_M_008	43	The guiding principle of school education must always be the independently thinking citizen.
DE_M_008	44	Competence orientation devalues education
DE_M_008	45	Initiated largely by lobby groups, the reduction of educational requirements to a meaningless concept of competence has led to an empirically verifiable lowering of standards.
DE_M_008	46	Verbose competence grids displace teaching content.
DE_M_008	47	Education and the pursuit of knowledge take a back seat.
DE_M_008	48	We call for the influence of lobby groups on our education system to be reduced.
DE_M_008	49	Teaching German cultural heritage in the classroom
DE_M_008	50	German cultural assets, traditions and history are an intrinsic part of German identity.
DE_M_008	51	The AfD will oppose all efforts to remove, distort or reduce this from the curriculum.
DE_M_008	52	This content must be part of the compulsory curriculum from elementary school onwards.
DE_M_008	53	This promotes a love of home and a sense of tradition.
DE_M_008	54	Bologna has failed: reintroduce diploma and master's degree
DE_M_008	55	The EU-wide harmonization of courses of study (Bologna Process) has led to an increase in schooling.
DE_M_008	56	Academic freedom was curtailed and it became more difficult to change university.
DE_M_008	57	Employers criticize the low qualifications of Bachelor's graduates.
DE_M_008	58	The AfD wants to move away from modularization and competence orientation and reintroduce the tried and tested Diplom and Magister degree courses.
DE_M_016	1	Our energy concept for the future
DE_M_016	2	A secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy supply is an obligation for our industrialized country, not an optional extra.
DE_M_016	3	Ensuring an intelligent energy mix
DE_M_016	4	We will decisively advance the expansion of renewable energies and therefore expand them much faster in order to meet the sharp rise in energy demand.
DE_M_016	5	Only in this way will the energy transition succeed in all areas, and only in this way will the Paris climate targets be achieved.
DE_M_016	6	We rely on an intelligent and diversified energy mix that is sustainable and secure.
DE_M_016	7	This includes energy generation from the sun and wind as well as sustainable biomass, hydropower and geothermal energy in rural areas.
DE_M_016	8	Public acceptance will be just as crucial for the expansion of renewable energies as planning security and less bureaucracy.
DE_M_016	9	Promoting energy efficiency
DE_M_016	10	To increase efficiency, we focus primarily on technological development and innovation - for both products and processes.
DE_M_016	11	This includes neighborhood approaches,
DE_M_016	12	heat efficiency, the expansion and modernization of heat and electricity grids, the
DE_M_016	13	Digitalization and operational optimizations as well as the expansion of storage capacities and energy-efficient building standards.
DE_M_016	14	We will make the KfW programs even more attractive in order to promote the energy-efficient refurbishment of residential and commercial properties.
DE_M_016	15	We want to extend tax incentives for building refurbishment to rented properties and commercial properties.
DE_M_016	16	We will favor commercial investments that contribute to energy efficiency and CO2 reduction through faster depreciation.
DE_M_016	17	Making Germany the No. 1 hydrogen country
DE_M_016	18	Many of the technologies required for the transformation already exist.
DE_M_016	19	CO2-neutral hydrogen plays an important role here - as a versatile energy source, flexible energy storage medium and important raw material for chemical processes.
DE_M_016	20	Hydrogen enables decarbonization even where renewable energy cannot be used directly.
DE_M_016	21	Major industrial processes, such as in the steel and cement industries, can only be made climate-neutral with hydrogen.
DE_M_016	22	And we can also make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 in the area of mobility, in the short and medium term for truck and ship transportation, by using hydrogen.
DE_M_016	23	The task now is therefore to establish a comprehensive value chain for hydrogen production, including the necessary network infrastructure.
DE_M_016	24	We will strengthen the national hydrogen agency in order to implement the hydrogen strategy and promote international cooperation on the import of hydrogen, the expansion of infrastructure and the conversion of existing systems.
DE_M_016	25	We want to accelerate innovation cycles, promote Power-to-X technologies in a targeted manner and create a market framework for climate-neutral gases with the necessary infrastructure based on existing gas pipelines and storage facilities as well as CO2 transparency in Europe.
DE_M_016	26	We will expand Germany's position with research into the series production of electrolyzers and fuel cells and by setting up hydrogen technology and innovation centers.
DE_M_016	27	By establishing a European hydrogen network, we want to ensure that
DE_M_016	28	meets future demand on the European and global hydrogen market
DE_M_016	29	can be used.
DE_M_016	30	"To this end, we want to further develop the ""H2 Global"" funding concept."
DE_M_016	31	We will produce hydrogen from renewable energies.
DE_M_016	32	In addition to this so-called green hydrogen, we will also accept blue hydrogen in the transition period.
DE_M_016	33	By establishing a strong European domestic market for sustainable hydrogen technologies, we are not only promoting Germany as an industrial location.
DE_M_016	34	We are also helping to create major international application opportunities for hydrogen technologies so that a global hydrogen market can emerge.
DE_M_016	35	We will expand the gas grids in Germany more quickly and upgrade them for the feed-in of hydrogen.
DE_M_023	1	We stand for a humanitarian and solidarity-based asylum and refugee policy in the European Union.
DE_M_023	2	That is why we will promote a functioning European asylum system with the necessary balance between responsibility and solidarity, which includes a reform of the Dublin system towards a solidarity-based distribution mechanism and fully respects and grants the right to asylum.
DE_M_023	3	The asylum system is to be further Europeanized and the European Asylum Support Office is to be expanded into a fully-fledged European asylum agency.
DE_M_023	4	We will defend the Geneva Refugee Convention.
DE_M_023	5	Pushbacks are a blatant violation of international law.
DE_M_023	6	Sea rescue is an obligation under international maritime law and must not be criminalized, but should also be guaranteed by the EU.
DE_M_023	7	As part of a comprehensive approach, legal migration routes should be created and the causes of flight and displacement combated.
DE_M_023	8	We will build a bridge to local actors and promote and support the willingness of European municipalities and cities to receive refugees.
DE_M_023	9	"This is to be made possible by federal quotas and thus also take up the willingness of many municipalities as part of the ""Safe Ports"" initiative."
DE_M_023	10	In addition, the European Union is to set up a vaccination quota for
DE_M_023	11	Set up refugees.
DE_M_023	12	People in need as a result of conflicts, epidemics or natural disasters need our help.
DE_M_023	13	As a rich industrialized country, we will continue to gear our commitment to humanitarian aid to the growing humanitarian needs and work to strengthen and expand the base of international donors.
DE_M_023	14	Furthermore, we continue to believe that it is more important to fight the causes of flight than refugees.
DE_M_023	15	Together with partner countries, we will therefore work to ensure that the Global Compact for Migration is fully implemented.
DE_M_023	16	The basic prerequisite for living together in a society of respect is the certainty that you belong, that you are accepted regardless of your family migration biography and that you belong.
DE_M_023	17	Germany is no stranger to migration.
DE_M_023	18	Our country has always welcomed people from other regions - just as Germans have found a new home in other countries around the world.
DE_M_023	19	This makes us richer as a society and helps us move forward.
DE_M_023	20	Our aim is to ensure that this naturalness and sense of togetherness is visible and tangible in all areas of society.
DE_M_023	21	It is about guaranteeing that all citizens have the same opportunities and possibilities - free from discrimination.
DE_M_023	22	To this end, we will strengthen the work of the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency and modernize the General Equal Treatment Act.
DE_M_023	23	At the same time, we will take strong action against racism, right-wing extremism, anti-Semitism, antiziganism, Islamophobia, anti-feminism, sexism and LGBTIQ* hostility.
DE_M_023	24	A better exchange and a coordinated approach, for example through the creation of a federal-state commission, is an important step.
DE_M_023	25	Crimes in this area must also be recorded and punished more consistently.
DE_M_023	26	Integration is a permanent social and state task.
DE_M_023	27	We want to guarantee all new arrivals the right to integration and participation opportunities.
DE_M_023	28	We are strengthening the integration and language courses for all immigrants in Germany, to which they should have access from day one - regardless of their nationality and residence status.
DE_M_023	29	All children must have the immediate opportunity to attend a daycare center; compulsory education also applies directly to all children.
DE_M_023	30	We want to give well-integrated people without a secure residence permit a permanent right to stay.
DE_M_023	31	Families belong together.
DE_M_023	32	Integration also works best with the family.
DE_M_023	33	We therefore want to bring the regulations on family reunification for beneficiaries of subsidiary protection back into line with those for refugees.
DE_M_023	34	We will also create regulations for the reunification of siblings of unaccompanied minor refugees.
DE_M_023	35	Everyone who lives with us should have the right to earn a living.
DE_M_023	36	We will therefore abolish work bans.
DE_M_023	37	The situation of years of chain toleration is also an obstacle to integration and must be ended by means of a deadline regulation in order to give people a perspective.
DE_M_023	38	We reject the forced repatriation of people to countries where they are at risk to life and limb.
DE_M_023	39	Nevertheless, our ability to integrate must encompass far more than the financing of language and integration courses.
DE_M_023	40	And it's not just about new arrivals.
DE_M_023	41	"The children and grandchildren of the so-called ""guest workers"" and contract workers of the 1960s still experience discrimination in their everyday lives."
DE_M_023	42	The public sector must be a role model when it comes to integration.
DE_M_023	43	In the interests of equal opportunities, care must be taken to ensure that marginalized groups of people also have access to jobs in the public sector and that all employees have the same opportunities for further training and promotion.
DE_M_023	44	In addition to target group-specific wording in job advertisements, recognition of diversity skills, recognition of qualifications acquired abroad and equal pay, we therefore also need a Participation and Integration Act that commits state institutions to a process of intercultural openness.
DE_M_023	45	Our society of respect needs a modern citizenship law.
DE_M_023	46	Now that we have already ensured that all children born in Germany are also German citizens at birth, we will also enshrine the general possibility of multiple citizenship in law.
DE_M_023	47	We want to abolish existing hurdles to naturalization and also shorten the current standard residence period of eight years.
DE_M_023	48	The fight against racism in German society requires a critical examination of our colonial past.
DE_M_023	49	We must deal responsibly with our historical guilt.
DE_M_031	1	Our program for consistent climate protection and climate justice:
DE_M_031	2	We are accelerating the energy transition and switching completely to renewables as quickly as possible.
DE_M_031	3	We want to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest.
DE_M_031	4	We want to disempower the energy companies and achieve an energy transition in the hands of citizens, in public or cooperative ownership.
DE_M_031	5	For a climate-neutral society, the phase-out of nuclear and coal must be followed by a phase-out of fossil natural gas.
DE_M_031	6	DIE LINKE wants a natural gas phase-out law with a binding phase-out path and social protection for affected employees and regions.
DE_M_031	7	We want Germany to be climate-neutral by 2035.
DE_M_031	8	By 2030, emissions must be reduced by at least 80 percent compared to 1990 levels.
DE_M_031	9	The target must be enshrined in the Climate Protection Act.
DE_M_031	10	Emissions trading does not offer effective climate protection.
DE_M_031	11	We reject emissions trading as a key instrument in climate protection.
DE_M_031	12	Primarily, binding climate targets and emission limits must set clear guidelines for companies.
DE_M_031	13	Subsidy programs and state infrastructure programs must support the conversion.
DE_M_031	14	Electricity, gas, water and heating may not be switched off.
DE_M_031	15	We want to ban energy cuts that affect low-income households and introduce a low-cost basic quota for electricity, water and heating fuel.
DE_M_031	16	We call for environmental and climate protection to be included in the constitution as an extension of fundamental rights.
DE_M_031	17	All political decisions and the disposal of property must be geared towards the common good, including climate protection and the reduction of social inequality.
DE_M_031	18	Binding climate targets and emission limits must set clear guidelines for companies.
DE_M_031	19	The state must not continue to support climate destruction with taxpayers' money.
DE_M_031	20	We therefore call for divestment, i.e. the withdrawal of the state from financial assets, investments and subsidies that flow into projects that serve the fossil and nuclear energy industry.
DE_M_031	21	Invest in renewable energy, disempower energy companies
DE_M_031	22	The energy transition will only be successful if it is socially just and shaped by the citizens themselves.
DE_M_031	23	The supremacy of large corporations in energy supply must come to an end.
DE_M_031	24	We want to organize the energy supply close to the people and as part of public services of general interest.
DE_M_031	25	Energy supply must serve the common good and be removed from the profit motive.
DE_M_031	26	Unjustified industrial rebates in eco-tax, grid fees, emissions trading and the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) must be abolished.
DE_M_031	27	They prevent the necessary structural change.
DE_M_031	28	Renewable energies must be expanded in such a way that imports of fossil fuels can be dispensed with.
DE_M_031	29	Electricity and heating grids must be transferred to public ownership and democratically controlled.
DE_M_031	30	Large energy companies are being socialized.
DE_M_031	31	If the coal phase-out is accelerated and a decentralized energy supply with storage systems is promoted, significantly less grid expansion will be required than is currently planned - driven by the profit interests of transmission grid and coal-fired power plant operators.
DE_M_031	32	We want a structural reform of the EEG.
DE_M_031	33	The proportion of green electricity must be increased to 100 percent as quickly as possible.
DE_M_031	34	Tendering systems are expensive, risky and complex for community energy projects; we reject them for projects up to 18 megawatts or five turbines.
DE_M_031	35	The expansion of renewable energies must be steadily increased in the next legislative period and in subsequent years.
DE_M_031	36	In the years up to 2025, we want to install at least 10 gigawatts (GW) of photovoltaics per year, as well as 7 GW of wind energy on land and 2 GW at sea.
DE_M_031	37	DIE LINKE supports a regionally oriented energy transition that is anchored in the population, for example energy cooperatives and bioenergy villages.
DE_M_031	38	Institutions, facilities, companies, cities and municipalities are to be given the legal right to purchase the grids they use for energy generation and self-supply.
DE_M_031	39	Ecological energy generation and affordable energy prices can best be achieved in municipal utilities with direct democratic participation of the population.
DE_M_031	40	At the same time, this creates the basis for promoting regional economic structures.
DE_M_031	41	Investors must be obliged to offer the local communities a stake in new wind turbines, photovoltaic power plants and energy storage facilities.
DE_M_031	42	The municipalities thus become co-owners.
DE_M_031	43	They must participate in the financial earnings of the green electricity operators in this way or through operator levies to local authorities.
DE_M_031	44	In order to drive forward the energy transition, we want to improve the legal framework for homeowners, tenants' associations, businesses and local authorities who want to take control of their own energy supply.
DE_M_031	45	DIE LINKE supports tenant electricity concepts for in-house power supply through photovoltaic systems on the roof.
DE_M_031	46	We want a solar obligation for new buildings as well as for existing buildings after a comprehensive roof renovation and if there is a technical suitability for solar power generation.
DE_M_031	47	Bioenergy from specially cultivated energy crops or newly felled wood should no longer generally be considered ecological and should not receive state subsidies as renewable energy.
DE_M_031	48	Green hydrogen in the energy transition
DE_M_031	49	With the help of hydrogen, coal and natural gas can also be replaced there,
DE_M_031	50	where the direct use of green electricity is not possible.
DE_M_031	51	Strategies to also run cars and building heating systems on hydrogen in the future are neither socially nor ecologically sound: its production consumes too much energy.DIE LINKE demands that hydrogen and its derivatives should in future only be produced on the basis of green electricity and only be used where there are no more efficient alternatives, such as in the decarbonization of the steel industry, parts of the chemical industry, in air and sea transport and for reconversion to electricity during dark doldrums.Where electrolysis plants are publicly funded, they must be operated at least proportionately by the public sector, and we reject the import and promotion of hydrogen from nuclear power or fossil sources.
DE_M_032	1	Tax relief for employees and companies
DE_M_032	2	"Austrian companies and the ""labor factor"" must be relieved of tax burdens."
DE_M_032	3	This ensures fair wages and creates jobs.
DE_M_032	4	Furthermore, employees and employers should not be played off against each other, as they are dependent on each other.
DE_M_032	5	This makes it clear that those who rely on class warfare from past centuries in today's world have no sensible answers for the future.
DE_M_032	6	It's about working together and not against each other.
DE_M_032	7	This is the only way we can secure a good future for Austria that benefits everyone.
DE_M_032	8	The economy creates work
DE_M_032	9	Only the economy can create jobs - this must be clear to everyone.
DE_M_032	10	Small and medium-sized companies in particular are taking on this task.
DE_M_032	11	The task of a government, on the other hand, is to guarantee optimal framework conditions so that companies settle in the country.
DE_M_032	12	It must also be a central task of economic policy to better equip domestic companies for international competition.
DE_M_032	13	Train skilled workers in Germany
DE_M_032	14	However, poorly trained or untrained migrants cannot compensate for a shortage of apprentices and skilled workers.
DE_M_032	15	At best, they result in wage dumping for Austrian workers and young people.
DE_M_032	16	Tax reform for the benefit of Austrian employees must come
DE_M_032	17	Instead, our main focus is on Austria and therefore also on working Austrians.
DE_M_032	18	Tax relief must be provided for them.
DE_M_032	19	The FPÖ had already taken the first steps towards this in the government before it was blown up by ÖVP Chancellor Sebastian Kurz for no apparent reason.
DE_M_032	20	As a result, the tax reform, which would have brought significant relief to Austrian employees, has also been delayed due to the fault of the ÖVP.
DE_M_032	21	However, the FPÖ will continue to push for implementation.
DE_M_032	22	We guarantee it!
DE_M_037	1	Education is one of the most important issues for our society.
DE_M_037	2	Education creates the conditions for all people in Austria to develop their talents, make a contribution and lead a self-determined life.
DE_M_037	3	However, the Austrian education system also has its challenges, particularly in the area of school education.
DE_M_037	4	International and Austrian studies have repeatedly shown that many pupils now lack important basic skills.
DE_M_037	5	We cannot accept these and similar developments, as they are to the detriment of both those affected and the general public.
DE_M_037	6	In a rapidly evolving world of work, where flexibility and lifelong learning are increasingly in demand, we need to ensure that every young person has the basic skills they need to make a contribution and lead an independent life, because we are living in times of change - technological progress is accelerating and economic competition is becoming ever more global.
DE_M_037	7	These developments harbor great opportunities as well as serious challenges.
DE_M_037	8	In order for Austria to be able to play an effective role here, we must once again catch up with the international innovation pioneers.
DE_M_037	9	We must build on our existing strengths in science, research and digitalization and ensure that innovations continue to come from Austria in the future.
DE_M_037	10	This secures jobs, prosperity and social participation.
DE_M_037	11	Advancing the digitalization of teaching.
DE_M_037	12	Austria's schools have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to digitalization.
DE_M_037	13	We want to develop and implement a master plan for digitalization in education.
DE_M_037	14	By implementing the plan, new teaching and learning content is to be introduced into lessons at our schools.
DE_M_037	15	The necessary technical equipment in our schools should be brought up to a standardized level by the end of the next legislative period and all pupils should have the opportunity to work with digital devices (tablets or laptops).
DE_M_037	16	For teachers, new content from the field of digitalization should become a mandatory part of initial, further and continuing training.
DE_M_037	17	And we want to create a standardized Austrian platform on which digital content is accessible to all Austrians.
DE_M_037	18	Create 5,000 new IT training places.
DE_M_037	19	The demand for skilled workers in the STEM and IT sectors will continue to rise.
DE_M_037	20	In the area of vocational secondary schools, colleges, universities of applied sciences and beyond, we want to focus on these subjects and create additional training places throughout Austria.
DE_M_037	21	Only well-trained specialists will make us attractive to the companies that create the jobs of the future.
DE_M_037	22	Introduce compulsory education.
DE_M_037	23	No pupil should leave the school system without sufficient basic knowledge.
DE_M_037	24	We therefore want to introduce compulsory education: Compulsory schooling can therefore only be completed once the minimum standards have been achieved - if this is not yet the case at the end of compulsory schooling, there should be further compulsory support measures,
DE_M_037	25	ensure sufficient basic knowledge in the main subjects.
DE_M_037	26	In this way, we ensure that all young people have the appropriate opportunities on the labor market and prepare them for a future in which they can lead a self-determined life under their own steam.
DE_M_037	27	Strengthen the dual education system, more permeability for apprentices.
DE_M_037	28	Apprenticeships are an important element of the Austrian education system.
DE_M_037	29	Our dual training system is one of the reasons why we have a well-qualified workforce and have fewer problems with youth unemployment than other countries.
DE_M_037	30	Many other countries are envious of our dual training system.
DE_M_037	31	This system must be strengthened and made fit for the future.
DE_M_037	32	Basic digital skills and industry-specific skills need to be taught.
DE_M_037	33	It should also be easier to do an apprenticeship after the Matura.
DE_M_037	34	Apprenticeships should not be the end of the line - permeability towards higher education and other forms of training should be further increased.
DE_M_037	35	Strengthen teachers as the cornerstone of the education system.
DE_M_037	36	Hardly any other profession is as important to our society as our teachers.
DE_M_037	37	We want to ensure that the outstanding achievements of our teachers are increasingly recognized in the future.
DE_M_037	38	In addition to fair pay, the main aim is to once again raise public awareness of what our
DE_M_037	39	teachers do every day.
DE_M_037	40	Our aim is to make becoming an educator one of the most popular and promising career paths for young people - ideally for a lifetime, but also for a certain period at the beginning of a career or at a later stage (e.g. as a career changer).
DE_M_037	41	Support staff for teachers.
DE_M_037	42	In order to meet the need for administrative support staff in the school sector, it should be made possible, in consultation with the federal states and municipalities as well as institutions of the Public Employment Service (AMS), for suitable persons from the AMS programs or
DE_M_037	43	Federal and contract staff can be employed in the administration of schools.
DE_M_037	44	It is also an ever-increasing challenge that many different social problems are being brought into our schools.
DE_M_037	45	To enable our teachers to concentrate on their core tasks, we need to make sufficient numbers of social support staff available in all schools.
DE_M_037	46	In cooperation with the federal states and municipalities, a qualified pool of personnel is to be established for this purpose.
DE_M_037	47	The staff should support the work of the teachers and help pupils who are in a socially or psychologically difficult situation.
DE_M_038	1	Continue to combat illegal migration - reform the asylum system at European level.
DE_M_038	2	Our strict asylum policy is having an impact: 85% fewer asylum applications were submitted in 2018 than three years previously.
DE_M_038	3	Our fight against illegal migration must continue with determination.
DE_M_038	4	Austria was able to achieve a decisive turnaround in European migration policy during its EU Council Presidency: The focus was no longer on the issue of refugee distribution, but on the protection of the EU's external border.
DE_M_038	5	The EU border protection agency Frontex needs to be strengthened quickly here, as well as close cooperation with the countries of transit and origin.
DE_M_038	6	We must continue to take consistent action against illegal people smuggling and minimize the incentives for people to make the life-threatening journey to Europe just for the prospect of a better life and without a reason to flee, as stipulated in the Geneva Refugee Convention.
DE_M_038	7	The consistent line on migration must not be softened again, as is currently being considered in some European capitals.
DE_M_038	8	On the contrary, we are committed to reforming the asylum system at European level: The waving through of illegal migrants must come to an end.
DE_M_038	9	In future, there must be penalties for states that simply wave illegal migrants through, undermine the Dublin Agreement or fail to take action against people smuggling.
DE_M_038	10	A corresponding sanction mechanism should be provided for in a new EU treaty.
DE_M_038	11	Preserving Austrian identity: Commitment to our culture and our tradition.
DE_M_038	12	Austria is a society based on solidarity.
DE_M_038	13	If you want to live here, you have to do your bit, abide by the rules and accept our values.
DE_M_038	14	It is our task to preserve our culture and what makes it special.
DE_M_038	15	As part of our culture, which, alongside Judaism and the Enlightenment, has been shaped for many centuries above all by Christianity.
DE_M_038	16	we see the cross and the Christian festivals.
DE_M_038	17	It is a matter of course for us that we uphold these values and want to bring them closer to the people who immigrate to our country and expect them to take an interest in our culture and respect our way of life.
DE_M_038	18	That is why we have made a clear commitment to the cross in the classroom and to the Christian traditions that we celebrate in Austria.
DE_M_038	19	Strengthen integration through the education system.
DE_M_038	20	The introduction of German support classes last school year was an important step towards improving integration through the education system.
DE_M_038	21	The results throughout Austria also show that the measure was important to bring the immigrant pupils up to a language level so that they can follow the actual lessons in the first place.
DE_M_038	22	The German support classes are to be continued in the future.
DE_M_038	23	While language acquisition is a basic requirement, there are of course many other elements that are important for successful integration.
DE_M_038	24	They also need more knowledge about our society and our legal system in order to be able to adapt to our basic values.
DE_M_038	25	"For this reason, a separate subject ""civics"" is to be created."
DE_M_038	26	In it, the basic features of our constitution and the Austrian constitutional state, the values and traditions that characterize us and the culture on which our country is based should be taught in our schools.
DE_M_038	27	This subject should be taught from Year 5.
DE_M_038	28	school level are offered.
DE_M_038	29	Headscarf ban for female teachers at school and for children up to the age of 14.
DE_M_038	30	Teachers wearing headscarves display a certain ideological attitude and propagate a social system in which women do not have the same status as in our western, enlightened society.
DE_M_038	31	We want school to be a space for the development of children far removed from socio-political constraints.
DE_M_038	32	In addition, we want female teachers to fulfill the state's educational mandate while adhering to the principle of neutrality.
DE_M_038	33	A headscarf is a clearly visible, demonstrative symbol that can influence pupils politically.
DE_M_038	34	This is why all female teachers are to be banned from wearing headscarves at school in future.
DE_M_038	35	The headscarf is a highly visible symbol with ideological and ideological connotations that ascribes certain roles to girls based on their gender.
DE_M_038	36	We want girls to be able to develop free of these stereotypes and for female teachers to be role models for them.
DE_M_038	37	In order to protect girls in the sensitive phase between the ages of 10 and 14, the current headscarf ban is to be lifted until they reach the age of 14.
DE_M_038	38	The age limit should be extended to the age of 18.
DE_M_038	39	Reduction of social benefits in the event of neglect of parenting duties.
DE_M_038	40	Parents play an important role when it comes to violence at school and violations of compulsory school attendance.
DE_M_038	41	However, many families - especially those with a migration background - are often not aware of the problem.
DE_M_038	42	Teachers often even have reservations about summoning the parents of such children, as conflict situations can arise time and again.
DE_M_038	43	The state pays parents certain social benefits for their children - in return, they take responsibility for their children.
DE_M_038	44	If this responsibility is neglected and children become violent at school or are absent for long periods of time without permission, effective measures are needed to demand that parents fulfill their duties.
DE_M_038	45	It should therefore be possible for school authorities and youth welfare services to reduce part of the family allowance if other measures are not effective.
DE_M_038	46	It will also be examined whether other social benefits can be reduced.
DE_M_038	47	The actual legal drafting is to take place in the first year of the new government.
EL_003	1	Μ. Eliades: to stand in solidarity with Europe
EL_003	2	Europe will go through a nightmare winter, with the natural consequence that a large part of its population will be exposed to serious risks, says Marios Iliades, candidate for the Presidency, in a statement.
EL_003	3	As he notes, among other things, in this very difficult time for our European partners, I believe that Cyprus must come in solidarity and help by giving the opportunity to European citizens to spend a large part of the upcoming difficult winter in a country, such as ours, with high temperatures and imperceptible winter for them.
EL_003	4	The announcement itself.
EL_003	5	With the gas shortages in Europe due to the informal embargo imposed by Russia, and the energy saving measures imposed by one European country after another, it is expected that Europe will have a nightmarish winter, with the natural consequence that a large part of its population (pensioners, sick people, children, lower economic strata) will be exposed to serious risks.
EL_003	6	In this very difficult time for our European partners, I believe that Cyprus must come in solidarity and help by giving the opportunity to European citizens to spend a large part of the upcoming difficult winter in a country, like ours, with high temperatures and imperceptible winter for them.
EL_003	7	Therefore, I propose and ask the government to elaborate as soon as possible and submit to the European Union, a programme for hosting European citizens during the winter months, in our hotels and in the rest of our tourist infrastructure, at a very low cost, subsidized by the Republic of Cyprus and by European funds.
EL_003	8	The aim and purpose of this proposal should not be to take advantage or exploit the energy crisis in Europe to increase our tourism revenues, but to demonstrate our practical solidarity with the tested citizens of the EU and to prove that we are not a country that only wants to take from Europe, but knows how to give, when and where it is needed.
EL_003	9	That is why the hosting of European citizens, in the framework of such a programme, should be done either at or below cost prices, provided that the necessary funding is secured.
EL_003	10	Apart from the benefits that such a programme will have for European citizens themselves, it will also contribute decisively to energy savings by European households, which will greatly facilitate the efforts of European governments to reduce energy consumption.
EL_003	11	Therefore, I propose that this proposal be put forward directly by our government to the European institutions, with the parallel proposal that it be extended to other European Mediterranean countries, which have similar or similar climatic conditions and tourist infrastructure to Cyprus.
EL_003	12	At the same time, the Republic of Cyprus should promote this proposal to the Mediterranean European countries, also through the Med 7 institution, of which it is a member.
EL_003	13	A similar programme specifically covering British citizens could be pursued in cooperation with the British government, as a minimum return for their steady preference for the Cypriot tourist market.
EL_003	14	It goes without saying that the implementation of such a programme will bring benefits to the Cypriot society and economy, (expansion of hotel and other tourist units, reduction of the period of unemployment benefit payment to employees of the tourism industry, continuation of air routes to several destinations and more), but I repeat that in no way should it be and is not the intended purpose of my proposal.
EL_003	15	What I propose, what I ask and what I want to see is our small Cyprus to put solidarity and mutual aid between European countries into practice and, at a very difficult time for Europe, to be actively present.
EL_019	1	Who won the Fund Managers' Awards 2018
EL_019	2	The Fund Managers' Awards 2018 were presented by the Panhellenic Mutual Fund & Bondholders' Association (PEMAKO), during the Athens Money Show 2019, to the best performing mutual fund managers.
EL_019	3	"Two prominent personalities of the investment market spoke at the event, on the topic ""Prospects for 2019""."
EL_019	4	The first speaker was Mr. Theodoros Krintas, Founder & CEO of Koubaras Ltd Behavioral Finance, who pointed out the advantages of the Greek economy in addressing the fiscal deficits and in gaining, albeit painfully slowly, stability and transparency in fiscal policy.
EL_019	5	In contrast, Mr. Krindas was categorically negative about the current tax policy.
EL_019	6	"""I don't believe at all in the tax policy that is being pursued now."
EL_019	7	"I think it condemns the country to produce less, since it criminalizes the greatest benefit one can produce from one's salary, or one's business,"" he stressed."
EL_019	8	He stressed that the government that will emerge from the upcoming elections should reduce indirect taxes, which account for 80% of state revenues, and subsidize work and not unemployment.
EL_019	9	Only such drastic interventions will boost savings and attract foreign direct investment, factors that bring growth, which is unknown in Greece today.
EL_019	10	"Finally, Mr. Kridas expressed his admiration for Greek mutual fund managers, as he considers them among the best in the world, as they manage ""in a market that is collapsing, to have positive returns every year""!"
EL_019	11	"He added that the triptych ""Property Management - Tourism - University Education"" could become Greece's ""heavy industry""."
EL_019	12	Then Mr. Alexandros Pappas, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pegasus Securities SA, spoke, who asked the attending mutual fund managers to emphasize the management of emotions.
EL_019	13	"""Good returns and small differences between them will not attract the customer."
EL_019	14	"The investor client will come because the manager is good, makes recommendations with longitudinal simulations of various investment mixes, and communicates regularly with his client in good and bad market times,"" he said."
EL_019	15	Pappas.
EL_019	16	At the same time, Pappas recalled that Aristotle taught his student Alexander the Great the balanced management of knowledge, emotion and will as the fundamental factor of success of every human being.
EL_019	17	Finally, Mr. Pappas congratulated Greek fund managers for their successful performance in a very poor market.
EL_019	18	This was followed by the presentation of the Fund Managers' Awards 2018 by Mr.
EL_019	19	Dinos Kalogeras, former Secretary General of the Association of Institutional Investors and a well-known executive in the field of Mutual Funds in Greece.
EL_019	20	In the top positions of the Best AIFM awards for 2018 and the three-year period 2016-2018 were, in order, Eurobank Asset Management AIFM, Piraeus Asset Management AIFM, Alpha Asset Management AIFM, Evropaïki Pisti Asset Management AIFM, 3K Investment Partners AIFM and Metlife AIFM.
EL_019	21	Awards were also presented to the top three funds, by category, for 2018 and the three-year period 2016-2018.
EL_019	22	It is recalled that the Fund Managers' Awards are based on the published performance data for all categories of funds, one and three years, and serve to provide accurate and reliable information to the investing public.
EL_019	23	They also personalise the trust relationship with successful managers and confirm management competence on an annual basis.
EL_023	1	"Artificial Intelligence predicts whether or not antidepressants will ""work"" on someone"
EL_023	2	Artificial intelligence may soon play a key role in the treatment of depression, as a new 'smart' system developed by scientists in the US is the first in the world that can predict with great accuracy whether or not a patient will respond to antidepressants, in which case they should seek alternatives such as psychotherapy.
EL_023	3	"The computer - with the help of an appropriate machine learning algorithm that analyses the activity in the brain scans of a person with depression (particularly the so-called ""alpha waves"") - is able to predict the effectiveness of drug treatment."
EL_023	4	The use of antidepressants has increased dramatically internationally over the last decades, but the drugs do not work for many patients.
EL_023	5	Many patients do not respond to antidepressants at all, while others experience side effects and even a worsening of their condition.
EL_023	6	Only about a third of patients (around 30%) react positively to the first antidepressant and experience a relatively rapid remission of their symptoms.
EL_023	7	It takes at least two months for the doctor to assess whether an antidepressant is working.
EL_023	8	Sometimes it takes years to find a drug that a patient will respond to.
EL_023	9	The researchers, led by psychiatry professors Madukar Trivedi of UT Southwestern University Medical Center in Texas and Amit Etkin of Stanford University School of Medicine in California, published the paper in the biotechnology journal Nature Biotechnology.
EL_023	10	The psychiatrists studied - as part of the 16-week EMBARC (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response) clinical trial - 309 patients with severe depression, who were randomly divided into two groups, one of which received the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft) and the other a placebo.
EL_023	11	"The ""smart"" SELSER computer system - developed with funding from the US National Institute of Mental Health - successfully predicted which patients would benefit from antidepressants within the next two months and which would not."
EL_023	12	These findings were subsequently confirmed in three other groups of patients.
EL_023	13	The next steps, according to the researchers, will be to complete a larger study that will definitively confirm the reliability of the new technique and eventually seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their innovative method and the development of an artificial intelligence interface that will be integrated into the brain scan machines.
EL_023	14	This will allow a more personalised treatment of depression in the future.
EL_023	15	"""It can be terrible for a patient when an antidepressant doesn't 'work'."
EL_023	16	"Our research shows that patients will no longer have to go through the painful process of trying other drugs to see if they work,"" said Dr Trivedi."
EL_023	17	"""I will be surprised if the new method is not widely used by doctors within the next five years,"" Dr. Etkin added."
EL_023	18	Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders and is estimated to affect up to 7% of the adult population, with symptoms that vary greatly from person to person in terms of type and severity.
EL_023	19	Among others, they may include melancholy, hopelessness, low self-esteem, sleep disturbances (too little or too much), low vital energy, physical exhaustion, unexplained body aches, appetite changes (from anorexia to bulimia), etc.
EL_027	1	Fourthiotis case: how the presenter is involved with notorious blackmailers - The weapon, the guilty DNA and the hot questions
EL_027	2	The policemen of the GADA's extortion department turned the house and the office of Menios Fourthiotis into a leaf and a feather after the thunderous developments in the case involving the well-known presenter.
EL_027	3	The Hellenic Police conducted a search at the house of the TV presenter in Dionysos and at the channel he works in Melissia and, according to the information available so far, computers and other data have been seized.
EL_027	4	He was brought along with two other people in the afternoon of Tuesday at the Department for the prosecution of racketeers of Security and this morning he is expected to be brought to the prosecutor as against him have emerged, according to information, incriminating evidence.
EL_027	5	The tangle of revelations about the dark role of the anchorman who has been in the public eye lately began when police officers identified that the shells from the Kalashnikov of the unknown man who shot outside the anchorman's house came from the same gun used by the perpetrators during the armed confrontation and pursuit of motorcycle passengers by officers of the DIA team in Nea Erythraia, in the early morning hours of April 16.
EL_027	6	At the same time, according to police sources, the DNA of one of the two accused was allegedly matched with genetic material found in the backpack abandoned by the perpetrators who escaped the chase.
EL_027	7	The DNA is allegedly matched to a person who was involved in extortionist/graft rings in Piraeus two years ago.
EL_027	8	According to information from the police editor of Vima and NEON, Vassilis Lambropoulos, the shell casings from the shots fired by the unknown persons against the police in Ekali allegedly match the shell casings found a day later outside the house of the presenter.
EL_027	9	"It is recalled that the journalist and publisher Costas Vaxevanis had named Menios Fourthiotis in his complaints as the person who was hiding behind a ""death contract"" against him, while he had accused him of orchestrating the attacks on his own house."
EL_027	10	In addition, by order of the head of the Prosecutor's Office, Sotiria Papageorgakopoulou, an investigation has been launched into the complaint of the journalist-publisher Kostas Vaxevanis that his life is threatened.
EL_027	11	The prosecutor ordered a preliminary examination to investigate the journalist's allegations and to establish whether and by whom the commission of offences is implied.
EL_027	12	Ms Papageorgakopoulou's mandate is to investigate any commission of the offence of provoking and offering to commit a misdemeanour or felony and, if evidence emerges, to identify the perpetrators.
EL_027	13	The video of the attack on the house of Furthiotis:
EL_027	14	The police managed to identify the two Greek perpetrators, from genetic material found in a backpack, which was dropped during the shooting of the police officers in Ekali.
EL_027	15	Indeed, from the evidence available to the police officers, it is alleged that Menios Fourthiotis was communicating with the two perpetrators of the attack against him.
EL_027	16	The perpetrators were known to the racketeering department, as their names had been mentioned in a case file for nightclub protection a few years ago.
EL_027	17	In addition, by order of the head of the Prosecutor's Office, Sotiria Papageorgakopoulou, an investigation has been launched into the complaint of the journalist-publisher Kostas Vaxevanis that his life is threatened.
EL_027	18	The prosecutor ordered a preliminary examination to investigate the journalist's allegations and to establish whether and by whom the commission of offences is implied.
EL_027	19	Ms Papageorgakopoulou's mandate is to investigate any commission of the offence of provoking and offering to commit a misdemeanour or felony and, if evidence emerges, to identify the perpetrators.

EL_039	1	"M. Rubio: ""Serious consequences"" for Maduro if he takes action against Guido"
EL_039	2	U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who visited the Colombia-Venezuela border on Sunday, warned President Nicolás Maduro that there would be very serious consequences if he took action against opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido, or U.S. citizens in the country's territory in crisis.
EL_039	3	During an interview with CNN, Rubio avoided answering when asked if he would support US military action to overthrow the Maduro government in Venezuela, a country in political and economic crisis.
EL_039	4	But the Republican senator stressed that he is confident that the administration of US President Donald Trump will not stand idly by if the Venezuelan government harms or imprisons Guido, who declared himself interim president last month.
EL_039	5	"""There are certain lines and Maduro knows what they are,"" stressed Rubio, a Florida senator who is considered a voice with a major influence on Venezuelan policy in Washington."
EL_039	6	"""The consequences will be very serious and immediate,"" he added."
EL_039	7	Rubio also warned Maduro against turning against US personnel working in the country and that the US government will react if something happens to Americans working in relief organizations.
EL_039	8	The Senator was among the members of a US delegation visiting the Colombian city of Cucuta, where humanitarian aid sent by the US is being stored in preparation for its planned delivery to Venezuela on 23 February.
EL_039	9	Although Maduro refuses to allow the entry of the food, medicine and other supplies sent by the government of.
EL_039	10	Guido pledged again on Saturday that hundreds of tons of aid would enter Venezuela.
EL_039	11	The 35-year-old president of the National Assembly announced that today, Monday, he will give more details on how aid to Venezuela from Colombia, Brazil and Curaçao is planned to enter the country, despite opposition from the government.
EL_039	12	"The February 23 deadline heralds a showdown with Maduro, who denounces a ""show"" as part of the ongoing attempt to stage a coup in Venezuela."
EL_039	13	It is not entirely clear whether the army will allow aid into the country, although its leadership has pledged loyalty to the elected president.
EL_039	14	Dozens of Western governments, as well as those of many of Venezuela's neighbours, have recognised Guido as the legitimate head of state.
EL_039	15	Maduro retains the support of countries such as Russia and China, as well as control of almost all state institutions.
EL_039	16	The US delegation also included Carlos Trujillo, US Ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS), and Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Ballart of Florida.
EL_043	1	EU Summit: what sanctions Nicosia-Athens seek for Turkey - Which countries oppose
EL_043	2	Nicosia and Athens are preparing to fight a tough battle to convince European leaders to decide on specific measures that will hurt Turkey for its provocative actions in Cyprus' EEZ at the Summit next Thursday and Friday in Brussels.
EL_043	3	What measures Cyprus and Athens are seeking.
EL_043	4	The first battle will be fought this afternoon at the EU General Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg, in preparation for the Summit, with the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Cyprus, George Katrougalos and Nikos Christoudoulides, briefing their EU counterparts on the issue of Turkish actions in the Cypriot EEZ.
EL_043	5	Nicosia, following the recent clear pro-Cyprus declaration by Valletta at the MED 7 Summit and France's stance that the EU cannot show weakness and stand idly by, a declaration that provoked the angry reaction of Ankara, is seeking - beyond a strong verbal support - the adoption of measures that will be implemented in a staggered manner based on developments on the ground, i.e: on the one hand, interlinking the chapters on Turkey's accession with the issue of Cyprus' EEZ violations? and on the other hand, specific measures against companies and/or individuals involved in illegal drilling.
EL_043	6	Only that all this means that the European Council should instruct the Foreign Ministers of the EU Member States to consider imposing measures in the light of developments.
EL_043	7	Britain is leading the way against taking action on Turkey.
EL_043	8	But Nicosia's efforts - co-sponsored by Athens - run up against the reluctance of some British-inspired countries - according to Phileleftheros - to support the adoption of measures and sanctions against Turkey, such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania - which holds the EU presidency this semester, arguing that in this sensitive phase relations and cooperation with Turkey should not be shaken - Sofia is even reportedly pointing out the possible impact of a decision on sanctions on energy and transport cooperation -, all the more so as any decisions on sanctions would constitute a 'campaign gift' for Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the eve of the crucial local elections next Sunday in Istanbul, which the Turkish president has declared a referendum.
EL_043	9	They argue that in case sanctions are imposed, it is possible that Erdogan will tear down the bridges with the European Union, with all that this implies for the Ankara-EU agreement on refugees.
EL_043	10	The battle at the summit will be crucial and in a few 24 hours it will be seen whether the diplomatic actions of Greece and Cyprus will have paid off and to which of them - the advancement of the accession negotiation chapters, the abolition of visas or the upgrading of the Customs Union - the Turkish actions in the Cypriot EEZ will finally be linked.

EL_048	9	Attract customers to their businesses - through safe operation certifications that strengthen consumer confidence and free digital media exposure.
EL_048	10	From the platform of the Delphi Economic Forum, Coca-Cola in Greece together with the Bodossaki Foundation issued an open invitation to companies, institutions and foundations to become participants in this initiative, so that together, they can support small businesses in the Ho.Re.CA sector, which is a key pillar of the national economy and is directly linked to the overall prosperity of the country.

EL_050	1	16:38 Maximou for Mitsotakis contacts:
EL_050	2	"""Foreign investors now see Greece differently"""
EL_050	3	The government is satisfied with the contacts that Kir. Mitsotakis' meetings in Davos with a number of economic and political players, as they mark a change of climate for the country in the eyes of the global business community after ten years of crisis.
EL_050	4	In addition to his participation in two events on the official agenda and interviews with foreign media (Bloomberg and Politico), the Prime Minister had more than 17 bilateral contacts with important political and business leaders in Davos in the framework of the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF).
EL_050	5	The Prime Minister, accompanied by his chief economic advisor Alexis Patelis, met, among others, with Microsoft's Chairman Brad Smith, Google's Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa Matt Brittin, ENEL's CEO Francesco Starace, Bloomberg's Chairman Peter T.
EL_050	6	Grauer, Visa Europe CEO Charlotte Hogg, WEF Davis founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) CEO Tadashi Maeda and Heineken CFO Laurence Debroux.
EL_050	7	From these meetings it emerged once again that large foreign investors see Greece differently than before July 7, encouraged by a new government that is reducing taxes and bureaucracy and implementing substantial reforms, but also by the political stability that is far from being a given in other European countries.
EL_050	8	In this context, there has been an increased interest in cooperation in areas such as the digital upgrading of the country, our cultural heritage, the increase of electronic transactions, the development of renewable energy sources, addressing climate change, waste management, the real estate market and other investments that make our country a central investment pillar in the wider Southeastern Mediterranean region.
EL_050	9	Large business groups are preparing on-site visits to Greece for meetings with the relevant ministers and to implement their plans.

EL_053	1	President Anastasiades: Turkey's position on the Cyprus problem is not accepted by the Europeans
EL_053	2	The European partners were adamant that it would never be possible to tolerate or accept as a solution to the Cyprus problem what Turkey is proposing, President Nicos Anastasiades said on Saturday as he briefed the leaders of the EU member states on the developments during the informal meeting on Cyprus that took place on 27-29 April in Geneva.
EL_053	3	According to a Presidency statement, in his statements to the media, on the sidelines of the informal European Council meeting in Porto, Portugal, the President of the Republic said that he had the opportunity during today's European Council meeting to provide a detailed update on what had transpired during the informal meeting in Geneva.
EL_053	4	"""I explained our will and determination to help find the necessary common ground that would lead the UN Secretary General to the decision to resume the talks, in order to find a solution within the framework of the UN resolutions, the mandate of the Secretary-General, but also what has been agreed from time to time, in particular, with reference to the very recent joint communiqué of 25 November 2019 in Berlin, and the letter dated 26 October 2020 sent by the Secretary-General to both leaders following the election of Mr."
EL_053	5	"Tatar,"" the President said."
EL_053	6	"He stressed that unfortunately, and despite the efforts, Turkey came with new claims outside the parameters, proving once again that what it is seeking is nothing but a new aggressive effort, ""with the claim of creating two independent states as a precondition, indeed, for any dialogue, the recognition of the Turkish Cypriot community as an independent entity, and then the two equal independent parties to meet to agree on the future relationship""."
EL_053	7	According to the President, the European partners have listened with great understanding to what he has said.
EL_053	8	"""And of course I have warned that the June European Council, which is crucial for the further relationship between the EU and Turkey, will be greatly affected if Turkey continues to insist on a totally unacceptable and illegal claim,"" he said."
EL_053	9	"""The understanding of the partners, especially regarding the claim for the creation of two states, was vertical."
EL_053	10	"No one argued that it would ever be possible to tolerate or accept as a solution what Turkey is proposing,"" he concluded."
EL_056	1	Scientists in Britain warn of new outbreak of coronavirus
EL_056	2	The UK government's scientific advisers have warned that the latest steps in the roadmap for exiting lockdown could cause a large increase in UK cases of coronavirus.
EL_056	3	Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that the next step of easing restrictions, namely the opening of retail outlets, outdoor catering, hairdressing salons and gyms, among others, will be implemented on April 12.
EL_056	4	He added that for the time being there is no data to make him believe that there will be a deviation from the timetable of the full lifting of the lockdown, i.e. the full opening of the restaurant sector and almost all sectors of the economy on 17 May and the lifting of all other restrictions on 21 June.
EL_056	5	However, published forecasting models from the SAGE scientific committee advising the government on handling the pandemic suggest that although next week's relaxation will not have a major impact on public health, the steps taken in May and June could cause a rise in hospitalisations to the levels seen in January, the peak of the second wave of the pandemic.
EL_056	6	"Another analysis, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), notes that removing all legal restrictions on social contacts in June ""could lead to a greater spike in cases and deaths, comparable to that seen in the first wave""."
EL_056	7	A similar warning of a potential new peak in hospitalisations from the end of July to mid-August is included in an analysis by researchers at Warwick University.
EL_056	8	"However, these scenarios are described by the authors themselves as ""preliminary"" and based on ""pessimistic assumptions""."
EL_056	9	Indeed, the forecast from Imperial College, on whose researchers' estimates many government decisions on the pandemic have been based, says that any future outbreak will result in about 5,000 hospitalizations, well below the nearly 40,000 hospitalized patients in mid-January.
EL_056	10	Prime Minister Johnson's insistence on the gradual and slow lifting of restrictions has provoked reactions from Conservative MPs and the Conservative press, who point out that the pessimistic forecasts of scientists are exaggerated scenarios that are not in line with the clearly improved epidemiological picture in the country and especially the significant progress of the vaccination programme.
EL_056	11	However, LSHTM professor and SAGE committee member Graham Medley explained that his colleagues are cautious because they cannot yet be sure about the effect of vaccines in limiting coronavirus transmission.
EL_056	12	"""The vaccine has only been around since December, so we don't know what effect it will have in three, four months, and that's the big question."
EL_056	13	"So it is a matter of genuine uncertainty,"" he added."
EL_056	14	Mr Johnson is particularly criticised for his admission that vaccination certificates or proof of a negative test will have a significant role in the daily lives of Britons.
EL_056	15	"As an example, former Conservative minister Ian Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail that the country is being driven into ""a semi-lockdown like hell, in which we have to constantly take tests, carry a vaccination passport and are under the constant threat of being locked down again""."
EL_056	16	The British Prime Minister is under pressure to bring the adoption of vaccination certificates to a vote in the House of Commons.
EL_056	17	As things stand today, in such a case he could be threatened with defeat despite a broad parliamentary majority, as more than 40 MPs from his party have voiced their opposition to the measure.
EL_056	18	"Opposition Labour leader Sir Kirk Starmer has also expressed reservations, saying that ""vaccine passports"" would not fit in with British customs."
EL_057	1	WHO: More than 55 hours of work per week increases the risk of premature death - The role of teleworking
EL_057	2	Working more than 55 hours a week increases the risk of death due to cardiovascular problems, according to research by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), a trend that appears to be increasing, with the agencies warning that it may worsen further due to the covid-19 pandemic.
EL_057	3	The first global survey of deaths due to long working hours, published in the journal Environment Intenational, showed that in 2016, 745,000 people died of stroke or heart disease due to long hours at work.
EL_057	4	This is an increase of almost 30% compared to 2000.
EL_057	5	Hours of work and premature death.
EL_057	6	Working 55 or more hours a week is a serious health risk, said Maria Neira, director of the WHO's Environment, Climate Change and Health Division.
EL_057	7	What we want to do with this information is to promote more action, more protection for workers, he added.
EL_057	8	The time has come for everyone - governments, employers and workers - to finally admit that working too many hours can cause premature death, Naira stressed.
EL_057	9	The WHO and ILO study showed that most deaths were among men - 72% - aged 60 to 79 who worked 55 hours a week or more when they were 45 to 74 years old.
EL_057	10	It also concluded that people living in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Ocean region - a region that includes China, Australia and Japan - are most affected.
EL_057	11	Overall, the study, which looked at data from 194 countries, found that those who work 55 hours a week or more have a 35% increased risk of stroke and 17% increased risk of ischaemic stroke compared to those who work 35 to 40 hours a week.
EL_057	12	The survey covered the period 2000-2016 and did not examine working conditions during a coronavirus pandemic.
EL_057	13	However, WHO officials pointed out that the increase in teleworking and the slowdown in the global economy due to the health crisis may have increased the risks.
EL_057	14	The pandemic is accelerating developments that could fuel trends leading to increased working hours, the WHO pointed out, estimating that at least 9% of people work too many hours.
EL_057	15	Increase in working hours in the lockdown.
EL_057	16	"Citing research by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 15 countries, Frank Pega, a WHO expert, commented that ""the number of working hours increased by about 10% during the lockdown""."
EL_057	17	"Teleworking makes it more difficult for workers to disconnect, he added, recommending that ""rest periods"" be organised."
EL_057	18	At the same time, the pandemic has increased job insecurity, which in times of crisis pushes those who have kept their jobs to work longer to prove their competence, Frank Pega pointed out.
EL_057	19	No job is worth taking the risk of a stroke or heart disease.
EL_057	20	Governments, employers and workers should work together to agree on restrictions that will allow workers' health to be protected, the WHO Secretary-General said.
EL_058	1	Kremlin: We plan to cut off oil supplies to countries that support a cap
EL_058	2	Russia plans to stop supplying oil and gas to countries that support a cap on the price of Russian oil, the Kremlin said , but will make a final decision once it has analysed all the evidence.
EL_058	3	The Group of Seven (G7) is considering a cap on Russian oil shipped by sea at $65-70 a barrel, although the governments of European Union member states have not yet decided on the price and talks are expected to continue.
EL_058	4	"So far, we are sticking to President (Vladimir) Putin's position that we will not provide oil and gas to the countries that will set (a cap) and participate in the cap,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in his daily conference call with reporters."
EL_058	5	"But we have to analyse everything before we formulate our position,"" he said."
EL_058	6	"The Kremlin also denied that its attacks on Ukraine's power grid had targeted civilians, but said Kiev could ""stop the suffering"" of its population by meeting Russia's demands to resolve the conflict."
EL_058	7	"The Kremlin spokesman said that ""no strikes have been made on 'social' targets, nor will there be any -- special attention is being paid to this. ""As for targets directly or indirectly related to military personnel, they are therefore subject to strikes,"" he said."
EL_058	8	Asked how the suffering of Ukraine's civilian population is compatible with the positions of President Putin, who has said that Russia does not wish to destroy Ukraine or its people, Peskov said:
EL_058	9	"The leadership of Ukraine has every opportunity to bring the situation back to normal, has every opportunity to resolve the situation in such a way as to meet the demands of the Russian side and, consequently, to put an end to all the suffering of the population,"" the Kremlin spokesman said."
EL_058	10	"The Russian military denied today that it carried out strikes on Kiev yesterday, Wednesday, saying the damage to the Ukrainian capital was caused by ""Ukrainian and foreign"" anti-aircraft missiles."
EL_058	11	No blow was struck in Kiev.
EL_058	12	"All the damage in the city, reported by the Kiev regime, is a consequence of the fall of foreign and Ukrainian anti-aircraft defense missiles, installed in residential areas of the Ukrainian capital,"" said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov."
EL_058	13	"Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that contacts with the UN agency on security at the Russian-owned Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine were ""constructive""."
EL_058	14	The head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) met with a Russian delegation in Istanbul yesterday, Wednesday, to discuss security at the station, the site of which Ukraine and Moscow accuse each other of bombing.
EL_058	15	Sergei Ryabkov also said that Russia does not plan to contact the United States and did not have the initiative to contact Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia.
EL_058	16	Ryabkov added that contacts with Washington are made by telephone, but take place through diplomatic channels and not at the level of presidents.
EL_058	17	In another development, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said today that it had prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it described as sabotage on the South Stream gas pipeline.
EL_058	18	"As a result of a series of investigative measures, the FSB prevented an attempt by Ukrainian special forces to commit an act of sabotage and terrorism on the South Stream gas pipeline that supplies energy resources to Turkey and Europe,"" the FSB said."
EL_058	19	In addition, it is not clear which gas pipeline the FSB was referring to.
EL_058	20	South Stream , which was originally intended to carry Russian gas under the Black Sea to the Bulgarian coast, was abandoned in 2014 in favour of TurkStream , which reaches Turkey and can supply gas to Hungary and Bulgaria.
EL_064	1	"""Cassandra"" Nurielle Rubini... strikes again:"
EL_064	2	"World War III has already begun - ""Sees"" a crisis in the Aegean"
EL_064	3	"The Iranian-American analyst in the new book entitled ""MegaThreats"", while arguing that World War III has already begun."
EL_064	4	"He says the world has changed since he was growing up: ""Growing up I didn't worry about a war between great powers or a nuclear winter, as we had a recession between the Soviet Union and the West."
EL_064	5	I didn't hear the words climate change or global pandemic back then.
EL_064	6	And nobody was worried that robots would take over most of the jobs.
EL_064	7	"""We had freer trade and globalization, we lived in stable democracies, even if they weren't perfect."
EL_064	8	The debt was very low, the population was not in such proportions, the pension and health care systems were working.
EL_064	9	That's the kind of world I grew up in.
EL_064	10	"And now I have to worry about all these things - like everyone else."""
EL_064	11	"These issues, he says, are also of concern to international institutions and explains that the third world war has begun ""At the IMF meeting in New York, economic historian Niall Ferguson said in a speech there that we would be lucky if we had an economic crisis like the 1970s - and not a war like the 1940s"" and stresses that ""the third world war has already begun, certainly in Ukraine and on the internet""."
EL_064	12	In this context, the priorities that world leaders must now have are war in Ukraine and the global recession with soaring inflation.
EL_064	13	"The eurozone, Rubinny says, ""is already in recession, and I think it's going to be a long and nasty one."""
EL_064	14	The major powers will have to decide which alliances to keep.
EL_064	15	"""Europe will not be able to be with both China and the US"", he stresses."
EL_064	16	But Germany, Rubini says, was wrong to rely so much on its energy dependence on Russia and is now repeating the same mistake with China, which is increasing its economic, financial and commercial power around the globe.
EL_064	17	As far as the global economy is concerned, Roubini says that we are in a worse situation than in the 1970s.
EL_064	18	"""Back then we did not have the same public and private debt."

EL_064	20	Today there are more geopolitical shocks, which affects the oil crisis.
EL_064	21	Just imagine the impact of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, which produces 50% of the world's semiconductors and 80% of high-tech semiconductors.
EL_064	22	That would be a real world shock.
EL_064	23	"Today we rely more on semiconductors than on oil."""
EL_064	24	Central banks, he believes, do not have much choice.
EL_064	25	"They can continue to raise interest rates to fight inflation or they can ""disappear"" and cut rates fearing a recession, he says."
EL_064	26	"Finally, on the future of the Republic, Roubini says he is very worried - and makes a reference to Greece ""In times of crisis there is always someone who plays Saviour and blames everything on foreigners."

EL_073	1	"WHO: Calls for ""immediate action"" against adulterated medicines"
EL_073	2	Following the deaths of more than 300 children due to adulterated cough syrups, the World Health Organization today called for immediate and coordinated action to eliminate non-compliant and counterfeit medicines.
EL_073	3	During the last four months, at least seven countries have reported cases of cough syrups for children sold freely without a prescription, the WHO said.
EL_073	4	More than 300 deaths were linked to taking these drugs in three countries including The Gambia, Indonesia and Uzbekistan, the WHO said, adding that most of the deaths involved children under five years old.
EL_073	5	Reported cases include confirmed or suspected contamination from antitussive syrups manufactured in India with high levels of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol.
EL_073	6	"These harmful substances are toxic chemicals used as industrial solvents and antifreezes and can be lethal even if taken in small quantities,"" the WHO warned, adding that these products should never be found in medicines."
EL_073	7	The WHO issued a first warning on child deaths observed in The Gambia in October, followed by another warning a month later focusing on Indonesia and another earlier this month for Uzbekistan.
EL_073	8	The WHO issued warnings against the use of syrups manufactured by Indian companies Marion Biotech and Maiden Pharmaceuticals and called on countries to redouble efforts to identify and withdraw from circulation any contaminated medicine, strengthen surveillance in supply chains and issue a warning if non-compliant products are detected.
EL_073	9	"For the WHO, these are not isolated incidents"" and calls for immediate and coordinated action."
EL_073	10	Regulatory authorities and governments should identify and withdraw any medical product that does not meet the standards identified by the WHO warnings, and ensure that the products come from approved suppliers and that their sale is authorised by the competent authorities.
EL_073	11	Those who manufacture medicines should buy only pharmaceutical-grade excipients and only from trusted suppliers, the WHO insisted.
EL_073	12	They must keep complete records of their purchases and carry out thorough testing of ingredients before using them and issue certificates for the quality of a product.
EL_073	13	Finally, according to the WHO, suppliers and distributors of medical products should always look for signs of falsification and only sell medicines approved by the competent authorities.

EL_094	1	How much oil and gas are hidden in the Ionian and Crete fields
EL_094	2	Crete and the Ionian Sea hold surprises when it comes to hydrocarbons (!).
EL_094	3	"This follows from the statement of the President and CEO of the Hellenic Hydrocarbon Management Company (Hellenic Hydrocarbon Management Company) Yannis Basias, during an event held by the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEEE) on ""Hydrocarbons in the Eastern Mediterranean""."
EL_094	4	As the head of EDEY said during the event, which was supported by the Institute of Energy of Southeast Europe (IENE), there are areas such as west, southwest and south of Crete but also in the Southern Ionian Sea where the possibility of having large deposits, especially of natural gas, is great and that is why large companies have appeared.
EL_094	5	Yannis Basias made it clear, however, that at the moment in Greece there is research work and not mining work, except for Prinos, where 1% of the country's needs are produced daily. 500 million barrels.
EL_094	6	"""This means that if we really want to say that we will enter the period and in the region of the countries that have production, we have to discover deposits that in the period of exploitability are 500 million barrels or 3 trillion cubic feet and nothing less,"" he said."
EL_094	7	According to the speakers, the importance of oil and natural gas in Greece is indispensable, especially if one takes into account the almost absolute dependence of our country on imports and the consequent exorbitant costs they entail - in the last decade, they account for an average of 5.5% of GDP (!).
EL_094	8	"According to Yannis Basias, the research must continue and, as he said, ""after five years we will be talking about significant drilling and probably exploitable production, mining""."
EL_094	9	It is noted that the number of concessions made to date is 13.
EL_094	10	According to the President and CEO of EDYY, the reasons why there is so much interest are the many natural gas discoveries in the region, the new geological model since 2015 in the Mediterranean (deposits in carbonate rocks), the progressive improvement of drilling in deep and shallow waters (over 3,000 meters) and the development of technology.
EL_094	11	Sovereign rights.
EL_094	12	"""Securing sovereign rights now goes through the exploration of hydrocarbons"", argued among others the Executive Director of IENE, Kostis Stambolis."
EL_094	13	"""Not only in Greece, in many countries."
EL_094	14	"Yes, sovereign rights are not limited to hydrocarbons, but they are a key component."""
EL_094	15	Developmental impetus.
EL_094	16	The President of the Technical Chamber of Greece, George Stasinos, highlighted the developmental impetus of energy.
EL_094	17	"""Energy, in all its forms, can give a great boost to the country's growth and many jobs,"" he stressed."
EL_094	18	"Regarding the five new plots, one is adjacent to ""plot 2"" of Total - ELPE - Edison, the second is adjacent to ""plot 10"" of the Cyparissia Gulf, the third is south of the Messinian Gulf and reaches as far as Chania, while the two in Crete are located south of the island, below Gavdos and Lasithi."
EL_094	19	"In a recent interview with the Director of Health, Safety and Environment at HELLENIC PETROLEUM Research and Production of Hydrocarbons SA, George Mykoniatis, who was asked about the expected economic and social benefits from the exploitation of hydrocarbons in Greece, he stressed that the recoverable reserves of Patraikos alone ""will yield 200 million euros. 200 million per year to the state through taxation from the lease contracts and 20 million per year to the local government from the so-called regional tax"", i.e. in the 25-year horizon 5 billion for the state, which through the National Solidarity Fund for Generations will be allocated for the welfare state and the country's social security system, according to the Norwegian model."
EL_094	20	"Similarly, for local communities, he explains that ""a 120-140 million barrel reserve over a 25-year horizon means 300 direct jobs and 900 indirect jobs""."

EL_096	4	The Mansion has already counted the dots, the votes, so that, barring the unlikely event, on Wednesday evening he will have the confidence of the House of Representatives in order to continue in the Prime Minister's chair.
EL_096	5	Panos Kammenos at the press conference basically admitted that he and two other MPs, K.
EL_096	6	Katsiki and Maria Colla Tsarouxa.
EL_096	7	Which means that Thanasis Papachristopoulos, Vassilis Kokkalis, Elena Kountoura and Costas Zouraris will probably give their positive vote.
EL_096	8	Costas Zouraris (in a recent long statement he announced it) and Th.
EL_096	9	Papachristopoulos, who appears to agree with the Prespa agreement.
EL_096	10	In short, Alexis Tsipras needs six more MPs in order not to lose the government.
EL_096	11	"Assuming that Mr Zouraris and Mr Papachristopoulos say ""yes"", four more MEPs are needed."
EL_096	12	The two ladies, Katerina Papakosta and Elena Kountoura are expected to support the government majority.
EL_096	13	The Deputy Minister of Citizen Protection may not have clarified her position, but if the stability of the government depends on their vote, then it is almost certain that she will not bring down the government, which would mean the loss of her chair.
EL_096	14	The Minister of Tourism, who together with V.
EL_096	15	Kokkali is in distant China, far away from political developments.
EL_096	16	Under these circumstances, Yannis Saridis and Spyros Danellis remain to be counted.
EL_096	17	The MP of the Centrist Union recently stressed that if the government, after Mr.
EL_096	18	Tsipras with Mr.
EL_096	19	"Kammenos asks for a vote of confidence before the Prespes agreement comes to parliament, he will not get a vote of confidence from me and let's go to elections so that the people can decide what to do about this issue."""
EL_096	20	However, no one can be sure what he will do at the last minute and since the government is hanging by a thread.
EL_096	21	Finally, there remains the MP of Potami, Spyros Danellis.
EL_096	22	Stavros Theodorakis has already said that his party will not give a vote of confidence, but the attitude of his MP is another story.
EL_096	23	Many in the Maximos building are counting on his vote, something that will be confirmed or not next Wednesday night!
EL_108	1	The oil industry is also heading towards closure due to coronavirus
EL_108	2	The pandemic of the new coronavirus has also led the oil industry to a dramatic turning point, as demand remains low and tankers are waiting full with negative prices.
EL_108	3	As Bloomberg warns, the next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: large parts of the oil industry are about to start shutting down.
EL_108	4	"At the same time, several countries are relaxing the measures as the economic impact is too heavy, even though the World Health Organization warns against so-called ""health passports""."
EL_108	5	Summary The global death toll exceeded 200,000.

EL_108	18	As Bloomberg warns, the next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: large parts of the oil industry are about to start shutting down.
EL_108	19	Now shipping prices have risen to high levels as the industry runs out of tankers, a sign of how badly the market has been hit.
EL_108	20	The spectre of production disruption - and its impact on jobs, companies, banks and local economies - was one of the reasons that prompted world leaders to join forces to reduce production in an orderly manner.
EL_108	21	But as the scale of the crisis overshadows their efforts, failing to stop prices below zero last week, the shutdowns are now a reality.
EL_108	22	It is the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.
EL_112	1	Delivery schedule requested by the EU from AstraZeneca
EL_112	2	The reduction in deliveries of AstraZeneca's vaccine is as high as 75%, according to information from a technical briefing in Brussels.
EL_112	3	"A senior official even says that Europe is ""in the dark"" about what is going to happen in the next quarter."
EL_112	4	At the same time, the EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakidou, with newer statements expressed regret for the continued, as she said, opacity on the part of AstraZeneca and informed that she asked for a clear timetable from the company for the deliveries of vaccines in the first quarter.

EL_112	6	The EU remains united & firm Contractual obligations must be met, vaccines must be delivered to EU citizens - Stella Kyriakides (@SKyriakidesEU) January 27, 2021 Indicative of the problem of shortages that are beginning to appear in the EU, is the case of Madrid which put on ice all new doses of the vaccine for at least ten days, when it became known that vaccine supplies are running out in Catalonia.
EL_112	7	"""Tomorrow, the refrigerators will be empty,"" said Josep Maria Archimon, Spain's top health official."
EL_112	8	In addition, the Czech health ministry on Wednesday recommended that local health officials suspend COVID-19 vaccinations with the first dose for the next two weeks, according to the CTK news agency.

EL_112	10	Escalating confrontation.

EL_112	12	Kyriakidou also said that there are two factories in the United Kingdom from which the European Union has the right to supply AstraZeneca's vaccine.
EL_112	13	The Soriot interview lit a fire.
EL_112	14	"On Tuesday, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot claimed that the EU contract is based on ""best effort"" clauses, but his company is not committed to a specific timeline for deliveries."
EL_112	15	He also said the EU's late decision to sign agreements on vaccines left very limited time to sort out the ups and downs in production.
EL_112	16	Instead, he noted, the company's contract with the UK was signed three months earlier.
EL_112	17	Oxford is waiting for evidence about the British executive.
EL_112	18	At the same time, the University of Oxford said it expects scientific data on the effectiveness of its vaccine against the British mutant of coronavirus by next week.

EL_117	1	The stakes of cooperation and stability in the region
EL_117	2	The trilateral meeting of Athens, Greece, Egypt and Cyprus was not only a confirmation of the close cooperation between the three countries, located on both sides of the Mediterranean, but also a series of actions were launched.
EL_117	3	And these actions, not all of them, were included in the joint declaration that sealed the summit.
EL_117	4	It is clear that from the Electricity Interconnection, hydrocarbons, to the operation of the Permanent Secretariat for the trilateral mechanism, which will be based in Nicosia, what is emerging is that the three countries, as well as others in the wider region, are choosing to strengthen relations.
EL_117	5	And they confirm that much can be done in the direction of stability and peace.
EL_117	6	This is, after all, what is at stake for all countries, except for agitating and expansionist states, such as occupying Turkey.
EL_117	7	"It is made clear that the creation of a trilateral electricity interconnection between the networks of Egypt, Cyprus and Greece ""enhances economic cooperation and the security of energy supply, not only for the countries involved, but also for Europe, as it will create a channel for the transmission of significant quantities of electricity to and from the Eastern Mediterranean""."
EL_117	8	The declaration rightly points out that the electricity interconnection project, which links the countries' electricity grids, is an important component of the strategy to accelerate the development of the Eastern Mediterranean Energy Corridor, providing an alternative source of energy supply from the region to the European continent and vice versa.
EL_117	9	The meeting also reaffirmed the cooperation in the field of hydrocarbons, calling for enhanced cooperation through a series of agreements on the exploration and transportation of natural gas.
EL_117	10	What the Egyptian President said on this issue should also be noted.
EL_117	11	"""It is very important that we work together to create a pipeline from Aphrodite to the two liquefied natural gas terminals in Egypt and transport it through Greece to the Balkans and central Europe,"" he said, and this obviously points to an ambitious project."
EL_117	12	The establishment of the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum in the framework of regional cooperation and for the exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves, on the basis of international law that respects the sovereignty of all countries over their resources.
EL_117	13	The three countries sent a message to occupying Turkey for its provocations and systematic violation of the sovereign rights of Greece and Cyprus, while the Cyprus problem was also discussed.
EL_117	14	It is also important that Greece and Cyprus, two EU member states, are a bridge for building cooperative relations between the Union and Egypt.
EL_117	15	The common challenges and developments in the Mediterranean and the wider region call for a strategic partnership between Egypt and the EU.
EL_117	16	And this, because of the developments, is becoming necessary, necessary for all those involved.
EL_117	17	COOPERATION with Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Lebanon, Palestine, can work through a common platform of a broader alliance, currently in separate formations, aimed at stability in the region.
EL_117	18	That's the big bet.
EL_122	1	Interceptions: Meeting of the Committee on Institutions and Transparency concluded
EL_122	2	The closed-door meeting of the Institutions and Transparency Committee, convened following the joint requests of the opposition parties for a hearing of the former Secretary General of the Prime Minister Gregory Dimitriadis and three businessmen, has been completed.
EL_122	3	The former Secretary General of the Prime Minister, Gregory Dimitriadis, appeared before the Commission and testified.
EL_122	4	Southwest: efforts to create political impressions are in vain.
EL_122	5	"After the end of the meeting of the Committee on Institutions and Transparency, New Democracy circles noted that ""The efforts to create political impressions on the part of the opposition on the case of the former General Secretary of the Greek government have fallen on deaf ears."
EL_122	6	Secretary of the Government Mr.
EL_122	7	Gregory Demetriades not only appeared despite the opposition's cries to the contrary, but answered all the questions put to him, without invoking confidentiality, as some had anticipated.
EL_122	8	He also stressed that he had never visited the KETYAK, that he did not know any group from it, nor any persons, and that his cooperation was with the commander of the NIS and Kontoleon and little or no cooperation with other persons.
EL_122	9	He clarified that he has never dealt with malicious software and that under the government of the Southwest there has never been a purchase, supply or use of such software by state agencies.
EL_122	10	He made it clear in every way that the Prime Minister knew nothing about the legal connection of Nikos Androulakis.
EL_122	11	Asked about the extent of his daily involvement in the NIS issues, he stressed that it was absolutely necessary from his position.
EL_122	12	He noted that malware is a global problem that is also a concern for the Commission.
EL_122	13	At the same time, he stressed that he does not know and has nothing to do with the companies Krikel and Intellexa, recalling that the former came to Greece during the ministry of Mr.
EL_122	14	"Toskas with whom he signed the relevant contract""."
EL_122	15	"The same sources of the Southwest noted that ""and from today's hearing of Mr."
EL_122	16	"Demetriades made it clear, as acknowledged before the Commission and part of the opposition, that there is absolutely no link between the Greek state and the Predator malware""."
EL_122	17	SYRIZA: The New Democracy maintained the omertà.
EL_122	18	"""The Southwest, which claims that the opposition is deliberately cultivating a toxic climate, has today followed the exact opposite tactic with its announcements and leaks."
EL_122	19	"It basically maintained the climate of the omertà and made clear its intention not to shed light on the wiretapping scandal, the interconnection and Predator and the very real responsibilities of the Prime Minister himself for both the scandal and its cover-up,"" said SYRIZA rapporteur George Katrougalos in his statements after the conclusion of the meeting of the Committee on Institutions and Transparency."
EL_122	20	"""The very association by the majority of the Commission of the private individuals who were called to the hearing, and as you know it is now a given that they are linked to the Predator software with the NSA, which was the basis of the Commission's decision to keep the meeting secret, I think it is the best confession on the part of the government that the NSA and Predator were in a joint surveillance center."

EL_125	2	"As George Ventiris writes in his monumental historical work ""HELLAS OF 1910-1920"", published by ""ELEFTHERON VIMA"" in January 1931:"
EL_125	3	"""A lawyer for twenty-five years, Venizelos wrote in the newspaper ""White Mountains"" of Chania in favour of the cooperation of the Balkan Christians."
EL_125	4	Later he consulted the patriarchate to satisfy the Serbian demands on the question of the appointment of bishops.
EL_125	5	"His friends heard him say in Thérison that only the Balkan coalition would solve the Eastern problem"" On the road to war."
EL_125	6	"The crushing of the Greeks by the Turks, in the so-called ""Unfortunate War"" of 1897, had severely damaged the morale of the Greeks."
EL_125	7	In 1908, the outbreak of the Young Turk Movement, despite initial expectations to the contrary, led to the persecution of the Christian populations of the Balkans.
EL_125	8	"In 1909 the ""Goudi Movement"" brought Eleftherios Venizelos at the helm of the country and the necessary restructuring of the Greek army."
EL_125	9	In the next two years, Greece's war preparations proceeded.
EL_125	10	"The Ottoman Empire, ""the great patient"", was clearly collapsing in the Balkans."
EL_125	11	But this did not mean that Greece was in a position to act without allies.
EL_125	12	"""However strong Greece might become, she could not fight a duel with Turkey."
EL_125	13	It had to sacrifice part of its national aspirations for the sake of the other Christian states of the peninsula.
EL_125	14	"Only then would he not see them as entirely futile"".At Easter 1911, Prime Minister Venizelos was on an excursion to Pelion, having as his guest James David Bowercher, correspondent of the Times of London and diplomatically very active in Balkan affairs."
EL_125	15	"Through Bowser, therefore, Venizelos sent the following message to the Bulgarian government: ""However great the differences between Greece and Bulgaria may be, they should not be considered insurmountable."
EL_125	16	Their compatriots in Macedonia were in danger of extermination by the Young Turks.
EL_125	17	"In their common interest, the two states must come to an understanding as soon as possible."""
EL_125	18	About a year later, on 3 March 1912, Serbia and Bulgaria put aside (albeit temporarily) their differences and signed a secret pact that provided for a joint attack against the Ottoman Empire in case the interests of one or the other country were threatened.
EL_125	19	On 29 May 1912 a secret agreement was signed between Greece and Bulgaria, with both sides agreeing that each would support the other in case of a Turkish attack.
EL_125	20	In August 1912, Bulgaria and Serbia declare to Greece that they are determined to go to war against the Ottoman Empire.
EL_125	21	Athens is called upon to decide whether to participate in the war or not.
EL_125	22	"At the end of August Venizelos declares to the cabinet: ""Our treaty with Bulgaria is defensive."
EL_125	23	We are therefore not obliged to fight.
EL_125	24	But Bulgaria and Serbia decided to take part.

EL_125	29	"At the same time, however, Venizelos asks the Greek diplomats to negotiate with the Bulgarian side on ""territorial issues and benefits, which each state will demand after the conclusion of peace"".In September 1912, Turkey makes a surprise move: ""On 14 September 1912, Turkey suddenly announced the recruitment of the military corps of Thrace.

EL_127	1	Coronavirus: concern about a new wave in Europe
EL_127	2	A new wave of covid-19 is looming in Europe as the weather cools down, with public health experts warning that vaccine fatigue and confusion about the different types of vaccines on offer may limit the number of people receiving a booster dose.
EL_127	3	The Omicron B4/5 subvariants that dominated the summer still account for the majority of cases, but newer Omicron subvariants are gaining ground.
EL_127	4	Hundreds of new Omicron strains are being identified by scientists, World Health Organization (WHO) officials announced this week.
EL_127	5	The official figures.
EL_127	6	Figures released by the WHO late Wednesday showed that the number of cases in the EU reached 1.5 million last week, an 8% increase on the week of 19-25 September, despite a dramatic drop in testing.
EL_127	7	Globally, the number of cases continues to decline.
EL_127	8	The number of hospitalisations in many of the 27 EU countries and Britain has also increased in recent weeks.
EL_127	9	In the week ending 4 October, hospital admissions with covid-19 symptoms increased by almost 32% in Italy, while admissions to intensive care units increased by 21% compared to the previous week, according to data from the independent scientific foundation Gimbe.
EL_127	10	During the same week, hospitalisations due to covid-19 in Britain increased by 45% compared to the previous week.
EL_127	11	The desire for vaccinations is reduced.
EL_127	12	The covid vaccines adapted to the Omicron substrains B1 and B4/5 are available in Europe from September, along with the first generation vaccines.
EL_127	13	In the UK, only vaccines for B1 have been approved.
EL_127	14	In addition, European and British authorities recommend these vaccines as booster doses only for specific groups, such as the elderly and immunocompromised.
EL_127	15	"Things are further complicated as there is a ""choice"" of vaccine that can be given as a booster dose."
EL_127	16	But also the willingness of citizens to get vaccinated once again, a fourth or even a fifth time for some, is decreasing.
EL_127	17	"""For those who may be less concerned about the risks they face, the message that the pandemic is over combined with the absence of a major awareness campaign may reduce the vaccination rate,"" commented Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine."
EL_127	18	The wrong reasoning.
EL_127	19	"""So I'm concerned that the vaccination rate will be much lower,"" he added."
EL_127	20	"""Another element of confusion is that quite a large part of the population has been infected with covid in recent months,"" noted Penny Ward, professor of pharmacology at King's College."
EL_127	21	Some people may mistakenly believe that if they have completed their basic vaccination and then become sick with covid, they are immune, he explained.
EL_127	22	Since 5 September, when the new vaccines became available in the EU, around 40 million doses have been made available by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna in member countries, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
EL_127	23	However, the weekly number of weekly instalments granted in the EU ranged between one and 1.4 million in September, compared to between 6-10 million per week at the same time last year.
EL_127	24	False sense of security.
EL_127	25	Perhaps the biggest challenge is to counter the perception that the pandemic is over, which creates a false sense of security.
EL_127	26	The Gimbe Foundation complained that the Italian government, which will soon change, has not prepared properly for the autumn and winter period and stressed that the publication of a report on the government's management of the pandemic has been blocked.
EL_127	27	Meanwhile British officials warned last week that the emergence of flu and rising cases of covid-19 were already putting pressure on the public health system.
EL_143	1	When the Turkish attachés attended the activation of the S-300 in the...
EL_143	2	Turkey's reaction to the alleged activation of the S-300 system (23 August 2022) is very big, since it claims a simultaneous blocking of the Greek radar of Turkish F-16 aircraft west of Rhodes, an issue that has been reported to NATO.
EL_143	3	Invited by the FES.
EL_143	4	Almost 9 years ago, on December 13, 2013, an exercise took place in Crete during which the S-300 anti-aircraft system of our country's Armed Forces was activated on a trial basis, reveals Lt.
EL_143	5	Lazaros Kabouridis.
EL_143	6	See also Analysis: Turkey is building a private army in the footsteps of Russia.
EL_143	7	The exercise and the activation of the S-300 system were then attended by observer officers from NATO countries, invited by the Greek General Staff, as well as defence, military, naval and air attachés from other countries, who were stationed in Athens.
EL_143	8	This would have been of no significance at the present time, if the Turkish Defence Attaché, stationed at the Turkish Embassy in Athens, accompanied by his country's naval attaché, had not been present at the observatory of the exercise.
EL_143	9	When the two Turkish attachés received the approval of the Turkish General Staff to attend the exercise, they knew that the activation of the Greek S-300 system would be part of the exercise.
EL_143	10	They were aware of the activation of the S-300.
EL_143	11	The presence of foreign defence attachés in activities such as the aforementioned exercise carries a symbolism and certainly requires the approval of their staff since it should not be contrary to the interests and policies of their country.
EL_143	12	The then Turkish Defence Attaché and naval attaché at the exercise's observatory/Crete, 13/12/2013 ( i.e., at that time the Turkish General Staff, while knowing about the activation of the Greek S-300 system, approved the presence of the two Turkish attachés at the exercise's observatory, who also watched the activation of the system.
EL_143	13	At that time, the Prime Minister of Turkey was the current President R.
EL_143	14	Τ.
EL_143	15	Erdogan and commander of the Turkish ground forces, the current Defence Minister, H.
EL_143	16	Akar.
EL_143	17	(The then Turkish Defence attaché and the naval attaché at the exercise's observatory/Crete, 13/12/2013) The hypocritical ambiguous attitude of Ankara on the issue suggests that the Turkish side, although it was not opposed at the time (2013) to the activation of the Greek S-300, now clearly annoyed by the reversal of the air power in favour of our country, aims at stopping the procurement of the F-35 aircraft by Greece, as a counterbalance to the imposition of US sanctions and Turkey's withdrawal from the F-35 programme due to the procurement of the Russian S-400 system.
EL_143	18	Let Akar explain himself.
EL_143	19	The Turkish side and in particular the Turkish Defence Minister H. Akar, who uses aggressive hate rhetoric against our country, should explain to the Turkish public opinion and to NATO, the reason why he criticizes our country for the alleged activation of the Greek S-300 system, since during his leadership in the Turkish land army, the then Turkish Defence Attache and the Navy Attache were given approval to attend the activation exercise of the Greek S-300 system on the day of the distinguished visitors.
EL_143	20	Note: The photographic material of the presence of the two Turkish followers comes from a Turkish Think Tank that expresses the Eurasianists in Turkey who have been supporting Erdogan's government for the last 5 years.

EL_144	1	Snabel - ECB: The first interest rate hike did not work
EL_144	2	"""This move was not enough to change the outlook for inflation, however, even a recession alone would not be enough to tame price pressures,"" Snabel stressed in an interview with Reuters news agency, adding:"
EL_144	3	"""In July we decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points because we were concerned about the inflation outlook."
EL_144	4	"The concerns we had in July have not been alleviated... I don't think that this perspective has changed radically."""
EL_144	5	More aggressive movement in September.
EL_144	6	Analysts are betting on a 25-50 basis point rate hike in September, although Snabel's new statements leave open the possibility of an even more aggressive tightening of monetary policy.
EL_144	7	The problem is that at 8.9%, inflation is four times the ECB's 2% target and shows no signs of abating.
EL_144	8	"""I would not rule out that, in the short term, inflation is going to rise further,"" said Snabel, who is characterized for her generally conservative stance on monetary policy making."
EL_144	9	"""These inflationary pressures are likely to be with us for some time, they will not disappear quickly,"" he said: ""It will take time for inflation to return to 2%."""
EL_144	10	Although inflation is likely to slow down sharply in the coming years, Snabel admitted that the ECB's forecasts have been wrong in recent quarters, so more weight needs to be given to the actual evidence of price growth in order to make sound policy decisions.
EL_144	11	The risk of recession.
EL_144	12	The situation is further complicated for the ECB, as the interest rate hikes come just as a recession caused by rising oil prices seems a strong possibility for the eurozone.
EL_144	13	"Snabel acknowledged the risk of a recession: ""There is strong evidence that growth will slow down and I would not rule out that we are entering a technical recession, especially if energy supplies from Russia are further disrupted."""
EL_144	14	"""Downside risks to economic growth have also increased due to additional supply-side shocks caused by droughts or low water levels in major rivers,"" he stressed."
EL_144	15	"""It seems that, of the larger euro area countries, Germany is the most affected."""
EL_144	16	However, while a recession will reduce price pressures, it is not in itself sufficient to bring inflation back to the target.
EL_144	17	"""Even if we enter a recession, it is unlikely that inflationary pressures will abate on their own,"" Snabel said."
EL_144	18	"""The slowdown in growth then is probably not enough to moderate inflation."""
EL_144	19	The southern states.
EL_144	20	Another problem for the ECB is that interest rate hikes will disproportionately increase the cost of borrowing in the periphery of the bloc, putting more indebted states like Italy or Greece at greater risk.
EL_144	21	"Referring to the PEPP reinvestments, she stressed that ""it helps us to address the risks of fragmentation and the risks to the transmission mechanism associated with the pandemic""."
EL_144	22	He added, however, that the use of this instrument should be proportionate.
EL_144	23	This means that the tool will only be activated to the extent necessary.
EL_144	24	"""At the beginning of the pandemic we saw that short periods of intervention can be sufficient to stabilise markets,"" he said."
EL_144	25	How PEPP and TPI differ.
EL_144	26	"Asked about the difference between the PEPP investment and the new TPI instrument decided by the ECB, she said that ""it is different in many respects"": ""It is a permanent instrument and purchase volumes are not limited in advance."
EL_144	27	At the same time, it requires a broader assessment.
EL_144	28	"In particular, it requires an assessment of various eligibility criteria related to compliance with the EU fiscal framework, macroeconomic imbalances, fiscal sustainability and sound macroeconomic policies."""
EL_144	29	And he stressed that the Board has to decide which tool to use under which circumstances.
EL_144	30	It should also check the relevant criteria for these tools.
EL_144	31	And most importantly, it must make sure that the use of the tools is proportionate.
EL_144	32	"Proportionality implies three things: ""We have to show that the tool is effective, i.e. that it serves its purpose."
EL_144	33	We need to prove that the tool is effective, so there is no other tool that can achieve the same objective at a lower cost.
EL_144	34	"And, finally, the potential benefits must outweigh the potential costs or side effects."""
EL_161	1	Francesco Giorgio: Who is the companion of Eva Kaili who was arrested
EL_161	2	Like a thunderbolt in Brussels and Greece the news that the PASOK-KINAL MEP (who was expelled) is being investigated for corruption linked to the Qatar World Cup.
EL_161	3	Even more sensational was the news that her Italian-born partner Francesco Giorgio has been arrested for the same case, while Ms.
EL_161	4	Kaili has received a summons for questioning.
EL_161	5	Georgie is an experienced Parliamentary Councillor in the field of foreign affairs and human rights, and is also a keen sailor.
EL_161	6	He comes from Italy and works as an assistant in the office of an Italian MEP, in the same European Socialist group.
EL_161	7	He and Eva Kaili have been in a relationship for more than two years and last February they had a baby girl together.
EL_161	8	The couple met in Brussels, where the 33-year-old works as a consultant at the European Parliament specialising in International Relations and Human Rights.
EL_161	9	"""We met at work and I appreciated how serious, intelligent and educated he was."
EL_161	10	Then I found out that she has a heart of gold and cares for others and also respects family.
EL_161	11	"This was a good basis for everything"", Eva Kaili had stated."
EL_161	12	Eva Kaili had spoken about 1.5 years ago on the show Come and Smile about motherhood, saying with meaning I was late but I have to make a decision.
EL_161	13	It was a very important period because I did see that it is something beautiful that changes your life, but that doesn't mean that you interrupt it, while answering a question about whether she is close to having a child, she confessed: 'We are necessarily in a home stretch.
EL_161	14	About their child and their meeting Eva Kaili spoke about her meeting with her partner, their daughter and their life between Athens, Brussels and Milan.
EL_161	15	The politician, a few days after her election as vice-president of the European Parliament, had spoken to OK!
EL_161	16	and talked about how she met her partner Francesco Giorgio, how they chose their daughter's name and what her speciality is.
EL_161	17	Is there a story behind the choice of the name? Ariadne's algorithm, the history of Ariadne of Crete, my love for our history and mythology were the main reasons that led us to this choice.
EL_161	18	The fact that it is translated into Italian was the deciding factor in choosing it for New Year's Eve 2021 and as it is almost 1 year old we find that it suits her.
EL_161	19	Who does he look like? At first only her father, but those who love me say I'm slowly gaining points.
EL_161	20	Are you based in Brussels? Brussels and Athens.
EL_161	21	Milan in the holidays.
EL_161	22	How do you spend your free time as a family? Having stopped overseas missions due to a pandemic, we spend all weekends just being a family, cooking and trying out recipes with my mother, playing with my nephew, singing nursery rhymes, as everyone does at this time of their lives.
EL_161	23	When the baby is sleeping, reading or discussing and planning the next few days.
EL_161	24	What would you say is your specialty? All Greek time-consuming recipes.
EL_161	25	I also learned some Italian.
EL_161	26	Every month I try to accomplish something that I would usually copy from my sister.
EL_161	27	How easy is it to travel with the baby on the plane? How does she perceive all this? He's adjusted.
EL_161	28	The last time he stood up and waved to the people getting off the plane on the Brussels to Athens flight.
EL_161	29	She wants to see people smile at her.
EL_161	30	Will the baptism and the wedding take place in Greece? The baptism, yes.
EL_161	31	When this pandemic is well and truly over, we will see the details.
EL_161	32	How did you manage to keep your pregnancy under wraps? I didn't try to keep it a secret, I just don't feel comfortable making something so personal public, especially at a time when many families are counting losses from this unprecedented pandemic.
EL_161	33	It was also the telecommuting that kept us cooped up at home.
EL_161	34	It was finally found out when the baby was already 3-4 months old.
EL_161	35	When you met your partner, did you feel that this man would be the father of your children? No, I confess.
EL_161	36	We chose to be together after about two years of getting to know each other.
EL_166	1	Volkswagen scandal: settlement failed in Germany - They want to pay only €1,800 to each claimant
EL_166	2	In fact, as reported in the Financial Times, Volkswagen has launched a website inviting drivers to register in order to receive the amount of compensation due to them.
EL_166	3	This will, according to the publication, range from €1,350 to €6,200 per owner, far below the compensation paid by Volkswagen in the US , which ranged between $12,000 and $44,000 in 2016, a year after the scandal broke.
EL_166	4	According to deutschlandfunk, the Federation was negotiating in the proceedings with Volkswagen on behalf of some 460,000 claimants against it, who were seeking compensation.
EL_166	5	Car buyers consider themselves cheated because of the manipulation of diesel emissions software.
EL_166	6	On a recalculation basis, the amount of EUR 830 million corresponds to EUR 1,800 per claimant.
EL_166	7	The Volkswagen Group is in controversy over the case.
EL_166	8	As a reason for the failure of the out-of-court settlement, the company cited the fact that the lawyers of the Federation of German Consumer Organizations of the federal association had demanded excessive fees, which the Federation itself denied, while a member of the Board of Management described Volkswagen's (VW) behaviour in Berlin as puzzling.
EL_166	9	Already in the morning, the German automaker had offered a fee of 50 million euros to the lawyers of the Federation.
EL_166	10	Shortly afterwards, this very amount was presented by VW as an excessive fee, while the two sides were very close to agreeing on a final settlement.
EL_166	11	"""We did everything in our power to secure a good and fair deal,"" says the Federation, which through its director Klaus Mueller pointedly noted, ""The sudden collapse of the negotiations by Volkswagen is in keeping with the tradition of the Dieselgate scam."""
EL_166	12	The Federation was negotiating in the proceedings with Volkswagen on behalf of some 460,000 claimants against it, who were seeking compensation.
EL_166	13	Car buyers consider themselves cheated because of the manipulation of diesel emissions software.
EL_166	14	"Volkswagen is trying to get ahead of the ""bell"" of the court."
EL_166	15	According to the Financial Times, Volkswagen's attempt to pay the damages individually is intended to reduce the bargaining power of the class action against the automaker.
EL_166	16	Christopher Rother, a representative of 12,000 Volkswagen owners, says the move comes to reduce the impact of the court ruling against the carmaker when it faces the German judiciary in May.
EL_166	17	Mr. Rother, who was behind the owners' claim against Volkswagen in the US as well, notes that his company intends to launch an aggressive campaign to prevent consumers from individually collecting the compensation offered by the company.
EL_166	18	He is even prepared to pay the damages in advance, instead of the company, in order to get as many of the 460,000 claimants in court against Volkswagen as possible.
EL_166	19	The Volkswagen scandal chronicle What is the Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal?
EL_166	20	The scandal came to light in 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that 482,000 diesel cars with VW and Audi badges had special software that exceeded the checks of the measuring devices available to the agency.
EL_166	21	The special software reduces the power of the engines and also reduces the pollutants emitted as soon as it detects that it is being monitored by special machines.
EL_166	22	With this policy, German models only met the stringent emissions standards in the state of California when they were inspected by the relevant garages.
EL_167	1	"The ECB is considering the creation of ""bad banks"" if ""red"" loans increase too much"
EL_167	2	The European Central Bank (ECB) is considering the creation of bad banks if Europe's bad loans increase too much, says credit rating agency Moody's.
EL_167	3	In an analysis today, the house notes that the ECB's head of banking supervision, Andrea Henrias, said in a letter to a German MP that he personally supports the creation of a European portfolio management company, or bad bank, in the event of a significant deterioration of assets in the wider banking system due to the coronavirus.
EL_167	4	Although Enrias noted in that letter that the ECB has not taken a final position on the issue, the ECB's Financial Stability Review on May 26 referred to the usefulness of a bad bank as a means of dealing with the surge in non-performing loans.
EL_167	5	The option (of creating) a bad bank would be credit positive for European banks, because it would involve some degree of state support where needed, which would help banks to protect their solvency and possibly avoid failures, according to Moody's.
EL_167	6	The house acknowledges that obstacles to the creation of bad banks in Europe remain.
EL_167	7	If the legal barriers are reduced, the political ones could be increased, because they (the bad banks) rely on taxpayer contributions.
EL_167	8	He believes, however, that Enrias' statement and the Financial Stability Report suggest that the ECB is preparing for a scenario in which the recent supervisory measures to protect bank capital (CET1) would not be sufficient and stronger measures, such as a bad bank recommendation, would be required.
EL_167	9	According to Moody's, the ECB's flexible strategy to help banks cope with the impact of the coronavirus spread is effective, provided that EU banks face only a short-lived economic contraction that does not turn into a full-blown crisis and a spike in non-performing loans (NPLs).
EL_167	10	Such an adverse scenario would severely weaken banks' solvency (CET1) and jeopardise their ability to help the real economy.
EL_167	11	Given that the likelihood of such an adverse scenario is not zero, the ECB seems to be exploring all options well ahead of the possible evolution of NPLs, which takes place after a time lag, the house notes, pointing out that most EU banks' first-quarter results for the first quarter did not record significant increases in the NPL ratio.
EL_173	1	Unique findings from the prehistoric city of Akrotiri of Thera (Pics)
EL_173	2	Significant new evidence was revealed during the ongoing excavation work at Akrotiri Thera under the auspices of the Archaeological Society under the direction of Emeritus Professor Christos Doumas.
EL_173	3	The excavation is being carried out under the supervision of the Ephorate of Cyclades Antiquities and with the funding of Kaspersky.
EL_173	4	"In the interiors of the building, known by the conventional name ""House of the Thranians"" which is probably of public character, in 1999 the famous golden goat was found which is exhibited in the Museum of Prehistoric Thera."
EL_173	5	It was placed in a clay urn, next to a pile of animal horns.
EL_173	6	In 2019, an unexpected abundance of unique finds was found, under the destruction deposits: in Site 1, four neurotic vases that had been partially uncovered in previous excavation periods were uncovered, as well as bronze objects, such as two large double axes made of very thin bronze plate, but also other miniature ones, horn cores, tiny nuggets of one or more periderae.
EL_173	7	Also, faience newtos and nautilus models, a crystal oreo nugget in the shape of an octagonal shield, with remnants of red thread in the suspension hole.
EL_173	8	The above items were found under the footprint of a wooden structure, and may have been suspended from it.
EL_173	9	In the fills, at the end of the doorways of Area 1, rosettes were found, probably on wooden elements.
EL_173	10	Particularly emblematic is the inlaid fragment of a model of a tritone.
EL_173	11	The inscription, consisting of Linear A syllabaries and an ideogram, is written in ink and is presumably related to the use of the building.
EL_173	12	Loose layers of sea sand with small pebbles, gravel and soil on the floor of site 1 were attributed by geologist C.
EL_173	13	Vougioukalaki in tidal wave deposits (tsunami) that preceded the volcanic eruption.
EL_173	14	In Site 2, around the southern and western flank of the Kerata deposit, the sockets of at least six wooden piles were revealed, in which plaster was injected to create casts.
EL_173	15	From the excavation data it is deduced that the piles created a kind of grate on which the horns were deposited.At the base of the grate, mixed with horns, stone tools and utensils were found, such as 43 small open vases and 2 closed ones, while in direct connection with them, remains of fabrics and charred fruits were found.
EL_173	16	The dating of some vases to the Late Cycladic 1a period confirms that the building was in use and function until the final destruction of the city.
EL_173	17	To the west of the Keratheotis of Kerata another pair of clay cisterns was uncovered: the larger, inverted one.
EL_173	18	Inside the smaller one was encased, inside which, in the clay, a wooden box had been sunk, as its imprint testifies.
EL_173	19	Inside this box was kept a marble Early Cycladic figurine of a female figure of the Spedos variant in a supine position, incomplete at the neck with the head and at the legs from the knees downwards.
EL_173	20	The inner walls of both the clay boxes and the wooden box are coated with a bright red colour.
EL_173	21	In the south-western part of Area 2, two clusters of microcylindrical Early Cycladic vases came to light underneath crushed floor slabs, fragments of stone tools and marine pebbles.
EL_173	22	One consisted of 16 vases placed around a wooden object, the form of which it is hoped to determine after the plaster cast of its footprint has been retrieved.
EL_173	23	The second cluster consisted of 131 small vessels in a shallow cavity on the floor.
EL_173	24	Similar types of vases have been found earlier both in the wider area of the House of the Thranians and in the earlier phase of the settlement under the Square of the Cenotaph - an area probably associated with funerary worship.
EL_173	25	The small size of these vases, their coarse construction, their number, but also the total absence of parallel grave goods in Early Cycladic tombs, suggest that they were mass-produced vessels for a specific purpose.
EL_173	26	Their concentration in the above areas, with their strong symbolism, supports their interpretation as drinking vessels during the process of mass ritual acts.
EL_173	27	It is obvious that the ongoing research of the house of the Thranians at the southern boundary of the prehistoric town of Akrotiri, next to Xestis 3, - the important public building with the rich wall painting decoration -, is expected to reveal a lot more evidence that will give a new interpretative impetus to essential questions about the society of the prehistoric Aegean.
EL_175	1	Delphi Economic Forum - Barbitsiotis: The goal of a modern Europe is to leave no one behind
EL_175	2	"""The goal of a modern Europe is to leave no one behind in developments"", said Deputy Foreign Minister Miltiades Varvitsiotis, speaking at the Delphi Economic Forum on the future of Europe."
EL_175	3	"""There is no Europe if there is no welfare state and there is no Europe if it does not show solidarity with those left behind"", he said."
EL_175	4	Greece wants a social Europe and that is why it embraced the Portuguese initiative that led to the Porto Declaration.
EL_175	5	"""Social Europe and the welfare state have been the target of all the memorandum programmes in our country."
EL_175	6	"It is important to highlight and support the initiative that social Europe is an integral part of the EU,"" he said."
EL_175	7	"The deputy minister estimated that the pandemic ""leaves behind a very large economic scar""."
EL_175	8	But the Next Generation EU is the biggest financial instrument the EU has ever put on the table and distributed to Member States and can lead to the green and digital transformation of Europe, he added.
EL_175	9	"As Mr Varvitsiotis recalled, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis ""sent the first letter last year on 25 March, together with other European leaders, asking for a support package for European economies, which was transformed into this very large Recovery Package""."
EL_175	10	"This is, he said, ""the opportunity for our generation to manage this money in order to give the next generation many opportunities, not to waste it with the frivolity of the nouveau riche as we did with other European packages""."
EL_175	11	He said that in four decades Greece has drawn 200 billion in European funds and now in a few years it is going to draw up to 72 billion and with leverage it can be much more.
EL_175	12	"""In a few years we can have a lot of investments in key sectors that transform the economy, so that the next generation can live in a Greece that is a pioneer in creating new and different jobs that require skills, scientific training and meet the aspirations of the young Greek who studies, struggles to get postgraduate degrees, to excel,"" he said."
EL_175	13	Varvitsiotis: This is our moment to win our future.
EL_175	14	"He stressed that there are hundreds of billions ready to be invested in ambitious proposals and underlined: ""Greece must enter this competition of ambition and show its best face."
EL_175	15	"This is our moment to earn our future."""
EL_175	16	On the Future of Europe Conference, Mr.
EL_175	17	Varvitsiotis noted that it is a very open discussion.
EL_175	18	"""It is addressed to the citizens of the Union and it is a moment when Brussels should be silent and governments should be silent."
EL_175	19	We want to present to the Greek citizens what we have achieved over 40 years and for them to tell us what kind of Europe we want tomorrow.
EL_175	20	Because the most important thing is to listen to the citizens.
EL_175	21	"200 years ago we decided to leave the East and look to the liberal revolutions of the West, adopting very advanced constitutions for the time, and 40 years ago, with the insistence of Constantine Karamanlis, we became an integral part of Europe,"" he said."
EL_175	22	Varvitsiotis.
EL_175	23	"""In the 40 years that have passed, I would not say that our participation in Europe has been a quiet course,"" he said: ""It has gone through many trials, with a particular test in 2015, where we reached the limits of a real rupture and of course, fortunately, three successive parliamentary majorities and different governments decided with their vote in Parliament and of course the Greek people with their support for them, that Greece must remain an integral part of the hard core of the Union and the euro area."""
EL_178	1	Finance News Research : What is the future of work -
EL_178	2	90% of workers prefer teleworking
EL_178	3	According to the most recent IWG survey, the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a long-standing trend.
EL_178	4	11/01/2021
EL_178	5	12:42
EL_178	6	Has our world changed for good?
EL_178	7	"Are we all ""hybrid workers""?"
EL_178	8	Has the era of the traditional office finally come to an end?
EL_178	9	According to the most recent IWG survey, the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a long-standing trend.
EL_178	10	Over the last 10 years, technological developments and changes in the world of work have led to flexible forms of work.
EL_178	11	In 2018, in the UK alone, according to the Office for National Statistics, flexible working had increased by 74% year-on-year, while other surveys show that 90% of workers would prefer to work from home at least some days of the week.
EL_178	12	Many large companies have already accepted this change.
EL_178	13	Google and Facebook have announced that their telecommuting policies will continue, while Twitter will allow certain employees to work from home permanently.
EL_178	14	"And it's not just the tech giants: Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays, said, ""The idea of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past."""
EL_178	15	It is unlikely, however, that the concept of the office will disappear altogether.
EL_178	16	Professor André Spicer told the BBC that although he predicts a sharp drop in the time workers spend there, the work of the office will continue.
EL_178	17	And the fact is that offices provide some elements that are impossible to replace remotely: from face-to-face meetings to informal networking activities.
EL_178	18	So a return to the office will be inevitable, but most likely it will be very different from the past.
EL_178	19	"Journalist Oliver Ralph wrote in the Financial Times, ""When small businesses get back on their feet, they will probably look for more flexible spaces that offer smaller contracts and more options to grow or shrink space."
EL_178	20	"Many have discovered that they can indeed work from home, but that doesn't mean they will always want to."""
EL_178	21	CBRE estimates the cost of an office at £14,000 a year, almost half the salary of an employee in Great Britain.
EL_178	22	Investing in flexible workspaces can remove real estate costs from company balance sheets and improve a company's financial situation.
EL_178	23	In this way, the idea of a central headquarters where thousands of workers would be concentrated is transformed into a system of a system with a smaller central office being the main hub, and regional, cheaper small offices linked together.
EL_178	24	So people will be able to work closer to home, businesses will save money, and if a flexible office is needed, it can easily be set up.
EL_178	25	This solution can also prove to be a lifesaver for travel.
EL_178	26	For many years, commuting time to and from work was a major negative factor.
EL_178	27	But recent developments have given many workers the opportunity to avoid commuting altogether and spend more time with their families, and it has become clear how polluting mass commuting is: last March, researchers at Columbia University reported that in New York City, carbon monoxide levels had been reduced by 50%.
EL_178	28	For these reasons, teleworking or short-distance working is more attractive.
EL_178	29	Of course, when workers return, companies will need to ensure that the premises are safe, taking precautionary measures involving proper sanitary facilities and frequent disinfection, and workplaces may need to be redesigned to create more space and office partitions, a process that will evolve depending on circumstances.
EL_178	30	As the world struggles to recover from the pandemic, businesses are looking for ways to operate and innovate in the new normal.
EL_178	31	The needs of companies in the new working world will constantly evolve, with changes ranging from optimal decontamination to the ever-changing needs of the premises.
EL_178	32	The only certainty is that businesses will reconsider whether having offices serves them.
EL_178	33	In this context, the IWG has shown that flexible working models can be successful, and that the future lies in creating permanent mobility in the workplace.
EL_179	1	EE: An additional 9 billion to seven countries under SURE
EL_179	2	The European Commission has disbursed €9 billion to seven Member States in the fifth tranche of financial support to Member States under the SURE instrument.
EL_179	3	This is the second disbursement in 2021.
EL_179	4	Under today's operations, the Czech Republic received €1 billion, Spain €2.87 billion, Croatia €510 million, Italy €3.87 billion, Lithuania €302 million, Malta €123 million and Slovakia €330 million.
EL_179	5	This is the first time the Czech Republic has received funding under the instrument.
EL_179	6	The other six EU countries have already received loans under SURE.
EL_179	7	These loans will help Member States cope with any sudden increase in public spending to maintain employment.
EL_179	8	In particular, the loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly linked to the financing of national reduced working time schemes and other similar measures they have put in place to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, including for self-employed workers.
EL_179	9	Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the fifth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, which attracted significant investor interest.
EL_179	10	So far, 16 Member States have received a total of €62.5 billion under the SURE instrument in support loans.
EL_179	11	Throughout 2021, the Commission will seek to raise an additional €25 billion through the issuance of EU SURE bonds.
EL_179	12	Once all disbursements under SURE are completed, the Czech Republic will have received €2 billion, Spain €21.3 billion, Croatia €1 billion, Italy €27.4 billion, Lithuania €602 million, Malta €244 million and Slovakia €631 million.
EL_179	13	An overview of the amounts committed Overall, the Commission has so far proposed total financial support of €90.6 billion to 19 Member States, of which €90.3 billion has been approved for 18 Member States.
EL_179	14	Council approval of the proposed amount of €230 million for Estonia is expected in due course.
EL_179	15	In addition, Member States can still apply for financial support under SURE, which has a total intervention capacity of up to €100 billion.
EL_179	16	"Members of the Commission made the following statements: President Ursula von der Leyen made the following statements: ""The pandemic is not over."
EL_179	17	Businesses continue to face difficulties everywhere in the EU.
EL_179	18	We are here to provide support.
EL_179	19	We are protecting people from the virus, but we also want to protect their jobs and their income.
EL_179	20	With SURE, we are mobilising up to €100 billion in loans to help finance short-time working schemes.
EL_179	21	This fifth disbursement is important news for the six EU countries concerned, in particular for the Czech Republic, which is receiving support from the SURE for the first time.
EL_179	22	"We are all together in this fight: you can count on the EU."""
EL_179	23	Commissioner Johannes Hahn , responsible for Budget and Administration, said:
EL_179	24	"""Following the fifth successful bond issue under SURE, we have now disbursed EUR 62.5 billion to 16 Member States to help their economies and people recover from the Covid-19 crisis."
EL_179	25	SURE once again demonstrates the EU's commitment to help Member States to mitigate the social impact of the current pandemic.
EL_179	26	"More will follow."""
EL_179	27	Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economic Affairs, said:
EL_179	28	"""It has been a year since the first traffic restrictions were imposed across Europe."
EL_179	29	These and the subsequent restrictions were absolutely necessary, but they had, of course, a serious impact on our economies.
EL_179	30	"As we continue the fight against Covid-19, it is very encouraging to see further SURE funding flowing to EU countries, providing much needed European support to the workers and self-employed who are still facing this unprecedented crisis."""
EL_179	31	Background.
EL_179	32	On 9 March 2021, and for the second time in 2021, the European Commission issued the fifth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, for a total amount of €9 billion.
EL_179	33	The issue consisted of a single tranche, to be repaid in June 2036.
EL_179	34	The bond attracted strong interest from investors, thanks to which the Commission again obtained very favourable pricing conditions.
EL_179	35	These conditions are passed on directly to EU Member States.
EL_179	36	This achievement was possible in the context of recent volatility in capital markets, but also of rising interest rates internationally.
EL_179	37	Bonds issued by the EU under SURE are labelled as social bonds.
EL_179	38	This provides investors in these bonds with the certainty that the funds raised will serve a genuine social objective.
EL_190	1	Ford makes the leap to electrification
EL_190	2	"Called ""Go Electric"", a play on the company's ""Go Further"" slogan, the event showcased an extensive range of new vehicles designed to help create cleaner and quieter cities using environmentally friendly electricity."
EL_190	3	"Under the subtitle ""Ford Hybrid"", the full range of 16 new electric models covers all vehicle categories, from small family cars to SUVs and commercial personnel carriers."
EL_190	4	Coming soon are a Mustang-inspired high-performance SUV and in 2021 an all-electric version for the Ford Transit.
EL_190	5	This initiative marks a new milestone in the company's history, as it commits to offering a new range of efficient and enjoyable-to-drive vehicles designed to meet the needs of European customers, whether they are used for daily commuting or delivery services, or for high-performance vehicles.
EL_190	6	"""Ford Hybrid versions will make electrification more meaningful and more accessible to more drivers than ever before."
EL_190	7	"From the Fiesta to the Transit, every new model we launch will include an electric version that will be ideally suited to our customers' needs and affordable,"" said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford Europe."
EL_190	8	"""Beyond technological advances and connectivity, the models we are presenting today are just the beginning of our plans to develop a complete range of smart cars for a smart world."""
EL_190	9	Earlier this year, Ford pledged that all future models will include an electric version.
EL_190	10	Starting with PHEVs, the new Kuga, in Plug-In Hybrid version, will have an electric range of more than 50 kilometres.
EL_190	11	The new 8-seater Tourneo Custom Plug-In Hybrid personnel carrier is expected to have the same level of autonomy.
EL_190	12	Ford's range of hybrid SUV models will be complemented by the new, 7-seat Explorer Plug-In Hybrid.
EL_190	13	Ford also unveiled the new Fiesta EcoBoost Hybrid and Focus EcoBoost Hybrid passenger vehicles, which adopt mild hybrid technology for reduced CO2 emissions, improved fuel economy, more responsive performance and a more enjoyable driving experience.
EL_190	14	For commercial vehicle customers, Ford also announced that a new, all-electric Transit will join the electric commercial vehicle range in 2021.
EL_190	15	Designed to be powered solely by an electric motor, the new van will contribute to a cleaner and quieter environment while reducing operating costs for professional drivers and fleet managers.
EL_190	16	Ford's all-electric high-performance SUV, which draws its inspiration from the legendary Mustang, is due in 2020 with a 600-kilometre range.
EL_190	17	"""There is no one solution that meets all electrification needs as the data for each customer is different,"" said Joerg Beyer, Executive Director of Engineering at Ford Europe."
EL_190	18	"""Ford's balanced powertrain strategy is designed to help customers find the right solution to make their electrification experience more comfortable and enjoyable."""
EL_190	19	Ford is also exploring solutions to further improve the energy efficiency and autonomy of its electric vehicles by testing a prototype electric Ford Transit Smart Energy Concept 10-seat electric minibus.
EL_190	20	Offering a range of 150 km after a 4-hour charge, the prototype uses a chassis with battery electrification technology.
EL_190	21	To date, Ford Hybrid models available on the market include the popular Mondeo, the Tourneo Custom personnel carrier, and the Transit and Transit Custom van.
EL_190	22	Ford's future fully electric vehicles will be supported by the IONITY consortium, which aims to build 400 charging stations at major European hubs by 2020.
EL_191	1	US sanctions on the Iranian Foreign Minister
EL_191	2	The US government has imposed sanctions against Iranian diplomatic chief Mohammad Javad Zarif after the Islamic Republic's foreign minister turned down an invitation to meet US President Donald Trump, Iranian officials claimed yesterday Sunday.
EL_191	3	"In an article posted on its website on Friday, ""The New Yorker"" magazine reported that US Senator Rand Paul played the role of mediator with Trump's blessing and invited Zarif to visit the White House."
EL_191	4	Paul met with Zarif in late July in New York on the sidelines of the Iranian minister's visit to the UN, according to the magazine.
EL_191	5	Iranian officials confirmed this information yesterday, Sunday.
EL_191	6	"""During a meeting with a [US] senator, [Zarif] was invited to a meeting and then sanctions were imposed,"" Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiy said."
EL_191	7	"""A government always says it is [in] favour of negotiations and then sanctions the [Iranian] foreign minister (...), if that is not ridiculous, what is?"" added Rabiy, whose statement was broadcast on state television."
EL_191	8	"""We believe that these sanctions show that the politicians in the White House have to some extent turned this issue into a personal matter,"" he continued, calling this behaviour ""childish""."
EL_191	9	Relations between Tehran and Washington continue to deteriorate after the unilateral US withdrawal from the international agreement on Iran's nuclear energy programme in May 2018, which was followed by the reimposition of heavy US sanctions against Iran, which the Trump administration accuses of destabilising the region and seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.
EL_191	10	Since May, the sabotage and attacks on ships in the Gulf - Washington blames Tehran, which denies responsibility - as well as the seizures of tankers and the destruction of a US spy drone by the Iranian armed forces have sharply increased the tension.
EL_191	11	For Vice Admiral Ali Samhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, the invitation from the White House and the subsequent imposition of sanctions are a testimony to the failure of US diplomacy.
EL_191	12	"""Sanctioning Iran's honorable foreign minister after rejecting Trump's proposal to hold direct talks shows that the 'maximum pressure' train has stopped at the 'failure station',"" Samkhani sarcastically said, according to Iran's ISNA news agency, referring to the ""maximum pressure"" campaign Washington says it is exerting on Tehran."
EL_191	13	According to the New Yorker report, Mohammad Javad Zarif replied that it was up to the discretion of the political leadership in Tehran to decide whether or not to accept the invitation and go to the White House.
EL_191	14	He also pointed out his fear that this meeting would simply give the photographers a chance to capture them together, it would have no substance.
EL_191	15	Inform Tehran.
EL_191	16	But the Iranian leaders did not approve of such a meeting at the time.
EL_193	1	DW: War clouds in the Strait of Hormuz
EL_193	2	At the beginning of the week, the price of crude oil rose again above 70 dollars a barrel.
EL_193	3	"The reason? Nobody knows exactly, but the markets were alarmed by the announcement by the Saudi authorities that there had been ""acts of sabotage"" targeting two oil tankers."
EL_193	4	A few days ago, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had recorded four more sabotage operations.
EL_193	5	According to initial information, the attacks took place in the Emirate of Fujairah, one of the world's largest supply hubs, located very close to the Strait of Hormuz.
EL_193	6	The target was oil tankers flying the flag of Saudi Arabia, Norway and the UAE.
EL_193	7	However, satellite photos released shortly afterwards by the AP news agency do not confirm fears of widespread damage.
EL_193	8	"An attack on the West's energy sufficiency? Nevertheless, the US issued a clear warning to would-be attackers not to threaten merchant ships in the region, while Saudi Arabia also condemned the attacks, which it called an ""attempt to undermine"" the energy supply from the Persian Gulf."
EL_193	9	But Iran also described the attacks as harmful and worrying.
EL_193	10	So far there is no information on the perpetrators and their motives.
EL_193	11	However, the developments of the last few days show how sensitive the oil-producing countries, and their customers, are to anything that might disrupt the smooth supply of oil from the Persian Gulf.
EL_193	12	According to the US authorities, the Strait of Hormuz is responsible for around 30% of the world's oil trade, i.e. 17.4 million barrels per day.
EL_193	13	The route is equally important for the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.
EL_193	14	The Strait of Hormuz separates the Arab countries of the region from Iran, but in a way it also connects countries as diverse as Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq.
EL_193	15	At one point the width of the seaway is less than 50 km.
EL_193	16	The importance of the Straits is so crucial that every now and then it gives rise to rhetorical confrontations or even conflict scenarios between rival powers in the region.
EL_193	17	"Only recently, the Iranian Chief of General Staff Mohammad Bagheri threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz to navigation completely if ""hostilities intensify"", apparently referring to US sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme."
EL_193	18	"Bagheri is reported to have told Isna: ""If we cannot transport our oil through the straits, other countries will not be able to transport their oil through the straits either."""
EL_193	19	Deployment of US forces.
EL_193	20	The Americans are not indifferent: the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln has been ordered to head for the Persian Gulf, while American B-52 bombers are rushing to Qatar.
EL_193	21	"White House security adviser John Bolton warns that ""any attack on the interests of the US or its allies will be met with an immediate response""."
EL_193	22	One worrying detail: years ago Congress refused to give the president the authority to declare war on Iran's regular army, but gave him the authority to fight terrorism.
EL_193	23	"Just last month the US government designated the Revolutionary Guards in Iran as a ""terrorist organization""."
EL_193	24	"It is the first time that the US has included the armed forces of a foreign country in the list of terrorist organisations, along with al-Qaeda or the so-called ""Islamic State""."
EL_193	25	Even if prudence finally prevails, the leonardism will have consequences for the global economy.
EL_193	26	"As Wayne Gordon, an advisor to a subsidiary of UBS bank, points out, ""geopolitical tensions that we cannot predict could push the price of oil to levels above $100 a barrel...""."

EL_200	4	This is the interest of Greece.
EL_200	5	Helsinki no longer exists.
EL_200	6	It's like the old tale of the king.
EL_200	7	It is a game of impressions to talk about Turkey's European perspective when we all know that Turkey will never become a member of the EU.
EL_200	8	"We can say that the king is naked"", continued the ND MP, on Turkey's position in Europe."
EL_200	9	Dora Bakoyannis at the debate on Greek-Turkish issues at ELIAMEP.
EL_200	10	"Dora Bakoyannis argued that ""there is a worrying direction that the dialogue on The Hague is taking because it is written that if you believe that Greece should go to The Hague, you are a minority."
EL_200	11	What does not accepting The Hague mean? If Greece says I'm not going to The Hague.
EL_200	12	"What does Greece gain? Turkey has never recognised the court so it loses nothing."""
EL_200	13	"""Our policy is based on international law so that alone leads us to The Hague"", Dora Bakoyannis commented."
EL_200	14	George Papandreou: Our position is in favour of the force of law.
EL_200	15	"""I would put it more simply, do we want the force of law or the law of the strong? As far as Greece is concerned, our position has been clear for many years."
EL_200	16	"It is clear that it is in our interest, as is consistent with our international role, to be on the side that insists on the force of law,"" George Papandreou said on the issue."
EL_200	17	George Papandreou in his statement on Greek-Turkish relations at ELIAMEP.
EL_200	18	"""This dilemma is not a rhetorical one, it is becoming increasingly topical if one assesses the way many powers, such as the US today, operate on the international political scene,"" the former prime minister added: ""We see a tendency to downgrade international agreements such as, for example, the Paris Climate Accords, the US-Russia nuclear agreements, respectively with Iran."""
EL_200	19	"George Papandreou noted that ""instead of getting carried away by this logic, the position in favour of the strength of law should become the flag of Greece, in the EU, in the Balkans, in the Middle East, and in our own most immediate issues""."
EL_200	20	"The MP of Kinal added: ""I would even say, an integral part of our foreign policy strategy""."

EL_201	7	School drop-out is highest in secondary education where the courses are demanding and language difficulties exacerbate the problem.
EL_201	8	"""There are few schools with refugee reception classes, so not all children can attend Greek classes,"" he adds."
EL_201	9	And when last April, the Ministry of Education launched the digital Panhellenic School Network for the purpose of distance learning for students in lockdown conditions, the ARSIS Child Protection Service carried out 85 registrations of primary and secondary school students on the digital platform.
EL_201	10	"According to a statement from the organisation, ""during this period most families faced difficulties both because of a lack of digital skills and a lack of language understanding""."
EL_201	11	Problems also arose due to the inability to access the internet, and the fact that some families had only one device (tablet or smartphone) for the needs of all their members.
EL_201	12	In order to address these difficulties, the Child Protection Service of ARSIS, in cooperation with the school principals, ensured that parents came from schools on a regular basis and were provided with educational material for their children's activities at home, while work brochures were distributed to the children so that they would not lose contact with the educational process.
EL_201	13	After the end of the quarantine and the opening of schools from 1 to 26 June, many families did not want to send their children to school because of the fear of coronavirus.
EL_201	14	Thus, small Greek language classes for children and teenagers were created at the Child Protection Service and if the needs were not met, they were referred to the Youth Support Centres of ARSIS or other social organisations.
EL_201	15	The Child Protection Service supports around 120 children, aged between 4 and 18, from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and sub-Saharan Africa.
EL_202	1	FORTH: Photocatalytic materials that improve air quality
EL_202	2	"This newly established spin off, called ""PCN Materials IKE"", is the first at FORTH to be funded by the European Investment Fund (EIF), through the High Risk Venture Capital firm Big Pi."
EL_202	3	The object of the company is the production of innovative photocatalytic materials that have the ability, with the help of visible light, to degrade air pollutants, fight bacteria and destroy viruses, thus significantly improving the quality of the inhaled air.
EL_202	4	They are produced in powder form and are used mixed with various types of inorganic and organic materials (paints, coatings) to cover surfaces made of glass, plaster, cement, plasterboard, wood or metal, contributing to the cleaning and disinfection of mainly closed spaces such as hospitals, schools, hotels, biological stations, nursing homes, etc.
EL_202	5	Their action is long-lasting and effective in fighting diseases related to the upper respiratory system, such as asthma and bronchitis.
EL_202	6	They have been shown to be highly effective in the degradation of pathogens such as Staphylococcus Aureus, Klebsiella Pneumonia, Escherichia Coli (E-Coli) and MS2 Bacteriophage in wastewater, thus contributing to the fight against intra-hospital infections and the purification of wastewater.
EL_202	7	These innovative materials are completely safe for humans and can be used indoors, unlike existing technologies, which are based on UV-activated materials and are therefore only suitable for outdoor use.
EL_202	8	The company's headquarters is located in the Industrial Park of Anopolis (BIOPAN) of the Municipality of Hersonissos, in a specially designed area where the pilot production of these photocatalytic materials has already started.
EL_202	9	The head of the research and Director of the company Prof.
EL_202	10	"George Kyriakides, said: ""It is particularly important that after long-term research efforts and two successful applications both in the Malia tunnel (in collaboration with the Region of Crete) for the deconstruction of exhaust gases 4 years ago, and in the SEAP dispensaries (in collaboration with the General Staff) 2 years ago, there is investment interest in the establishment in Crete of a purely innovative Greek company, with a strong focus on improving the quality of life and fighting infections, at a time when these issues are at the forefront of the"
EL_202	11	Prof. Spyros Anastasiades, Director of IESL, said:
EL_202	12	"""We are particularly proud that a pioneering technology developed at IHDL is now finding its way to society."
EL_202	13	This innovative application was based on long-term basic and applied research, always of high quality, carried out in the Laboratories of the Materials and Devices Division of IESL in the framework of mainly competitively funded research projects.
EL_202	14	Researchers involved in Research as well as postgraduate students and postdocs were guided by excellence at every step, which always guides our course at IESL and FORTH.
EL_202	15	"We expect that the high quality research of IESL will lead to other innovations that will respond to the ever-increasing challenges facing society today."""
EL_204	1	Environment Grimaces for dinner: Madagascar on the verge of 'first climate change famine' 25/08/2021 15:37
EL_204	2	After four years without rainfall, many people in southern Madagascar have been feeding for months on grasshoppers and the little vegetation that remains.
EL_204	3	"The country is on the verge of the ""first climate change famine"" warns the UN, with 30,000 people currently living at the maximum level of food insecurity, level five, and the number is expected to rise dramatically."
EL_204	4	"""These are famine-like conditions due to climate change, not conflict,"" said Shelly Tacral of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), according to the BBC."
EL_204	5	"""It's unprecedented."
EL_204	6	These people have done nothing to exacerbate climate change.
EL_204	7	"They don't burn fossil fuels [...] and yet they take the biggest hit,"" he said."
EL_204	8	In the remote village of Fadiowa, in the province of Aboasari, families showed a WFP team the locusts they were consuming.
EL_204	9	"""I clean the insects as best I can even though there is hardly any water,"" said Tamaria, a mother of four."
EL_204	10	"""Me and my kids have been eating grasshoppers every day for eight months because we have nothing else and it hasn't rained to harvest what we sowed."
EL_204	11	Bole, a mother of three children who lost her husband to starvation, is in the same situation.
EL_204	12	He also took in the two children of a neighbour who also died of starvation.
EL_204	13	"""Today we have nothing to eat but cactus leaves."
EL_204	14	"What can I say? Our whole life is a search for cactus leaves, over and over again,"" he said."
EL_204	15	Madagascar is frequently affected by droughts and is often affected by the climate phenomenon El Niño.
EL_204	16	But many experts believe that the current situation is a direct result of global warming.
EL_204	17	"""In the latest report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change we saw that Madagascar is experiencing a worsening drought."
EL_204	18	"And this is expected to intensify if climate change continues,"" said Rodro Barimalala, a Malagasy scientist working at the University of Cape Town in South Africa."
EL_204	19	The drought in Madagascar is linked to atmospheric warming, agreed Chris Funk of the University of Santa Barbara in California, director of the Climate Risk Center.
EL_204	20	It is not only the rural communities that are at the mercy of hunger, but also many inhabitants of the cities in the south of Madagascar.
EL_204	21	Many children are begging on the street for some food, reports the BBC.
EL_204	22	"""Prices in the market are going up and up - three and four times over,"" said Tishna Edor, who works at the charity Seed in the city of Tolanaro."
EL_204	23	"""People are selling their land to get money for food,"" he said."
EL_210	1	Greek-Turkish: Is Erdogan seeking conflict with Greece to stay on the throne?
EL_210	2	"""This cannot be ruled out."
EL_210	3	"An armed conflict between Turkey and Greece is ""not only possible, but probable"", wrote historian Ryan Gingeras, who is a professor at the US Naval Academy in Monterey, California."
EL_210	4	Erdogan has been rhetorically preparing a possible military operation for weeks.
EL_210	5	"He says more and more often that Greece is ""occupying"" Aegean islands such as Rhodes, Chios and Samos."
EL_210	6	Erdogan's ultra-nationalist coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, even wants to incorporate Crete into Turkey.
EL_210	7	"""We will gouge out the eyes of those who despise our rights"" threatens Bahçeli""."
EL_210	8	How Athens responds.
EL_210	9	The Associate Professor of International Politics, Sotiris Serbos, and retired Vice Admiral Yannis Egolfopoulos spoke to MEGA about the Turkish threats.
EL_210	10	"Mr. Sermpos referred to the visit of Nikos Dendias to Egypt and Greece's effort to ""reverse"" the illegal memorandum of understanding between Greece and Turkey."
EL_210	11	"""The relations we have forged with Egypt are very important and will stand the test of time."
EL_210	12	Egypt is the balancing factor for Turkey's ambitions regarding maritime zone issues in the Eastern Mediterranean.
EL_210	13	"Egypt also has interests in Libya and has a role to play and in energy issues it is also involved,"" he said."
EL_210	14	"""With regard to the Turcolibos, it was only a matter of time before Turkey activated it."
EL_210	15	Of course there are legal tools for Greece and the way the international actor is set up.
EL_210	16	"For Turkey, the energy issue is existential because it wants to reduce its dependence on Russia and Iran, it enjoys greater autonomy, and it is also a country that is ""thirsty"" for energy because of its own needs."
EL_210	17	"The Turcolibiko started as Turkey's reaction to the Turkish narrative that ""they are trying to exclude them from developments""."
EL_210	18	"Turkey has also put a negotiating card on the table which, under certain conditions, could be taken back,"" he added."
EL_210	19	Sherbos.
EL_210	20	Read also: Erdogan: Why would he choose war with Greece? For his part.
EL_210	21	Egolfopoulos referred to the aggressive rhetoric of the Turks.
EL_210	22	"""The overflights have been going on since 1974 when we left NATO, and since then The policy of all governments to do what we have been doing so far has proven to be correct as a result."
EL_210	23	From my experience and 38 years of service, I have to note that no one within the Ministry of Defence has expressed the view that we should shoot it down.
EL_210	24	We are making interceptions, we are showing the Western world the aggression of the allies and NATO allies of the Turks in the West.
EL_210	25	As usual, it takes time for the Westerners to learn what is happening in our region, but now they have figured it out.
EL_210	26	The Prague Summit the day before yesterday highlighted this issue, Mr.
EL_210	27	"Erdogan scored a huge own goal because he showed what Turkey is looking for,"" he said, clarifying about the overflights."
EL_210	28	On the possibility of a hot incident on the part of the Turks, Mr.
EL_210	29	"Egolfopoulos stressed that ""therefore, at this moment we cannot talk about overflights having the upper hand."
EL_210	30	He's not going for a hot episode.
EL_210	31	He doesn't have the capabilities to take it.
EL_210	32	Military transfers from America since 2018, according to the official figures of the US State Accounting Office, have fallen to 7%, which is the remnants of some contracts that existed.

EL_210	34	He has been embargoed by Europe and Germany, his submarines are not going ahead, most of the boats he is building are not going ahead, his army in Syria is in trouble, the people are tired.
EL_210	35	"All of this, Mr Erdogan is not risking all of this to make a hot incident, because the risk he will take to move against Greece is huge and he doesn't know where it will end up."""
EL_210	36	"""Mr. Erdogan is a ""sure thing"", he wants to be 1000% sure, his history has proven this to us."

EL_211	1	How Greece can become an energy hub for Europe
EL_211	2	Greece can play a crucial role in Europe's energy security in the context of the redesign of the energy map after the gradual isolation of Russia.
EL_211	3	This can be achieved if it improves its energy efficiency, increases its energy production potential through investments in renewable energy sources and strengthens international electricity and gas interconnections.
EL_211	4	In this way, Greece can become a hub for the transfer of economic green energy to Europe and triple its electricity and gas exports over the next 10 years.
EL_211	5	At the same time, increasing the country's energy self-sufficiency by 2030 through the above-mentioned actions could bring significant GDP benefits of 2.5 to 3.5 billion per year.
EL_211	6	According to a study by the Economic Analysis Department of the National Bank of Greece, the country's energy dependence on energy imports is high as Greece produces only 25% of the energy it consumes (compared to 43% in the EU).
EL_211	7	This energy is renewable energy and secondarily lignite.
EL_211	8	In fact, due to its high dependence on energy imports, Greece is experiencing high energy prices for as long as the crisis lasts.
EL_211	9	These are 250% above the 5-year average in 9M 2022.
EL_211	10	At the same time, natural gas imports are important, covering 22% of energy needs, while the country's dependence on Russia is a source of uncertainty.
EL_211	11	According to the ETE study, with Europe on alert in case of a disruption of flows from Russia, Greece has access to substitute sources.
EL_211	12	Also, the redesign of the energy map can be an opportunity for Greece in the long term, provided that the country improves its energy efficiency by 20% and increases energy production through investments of up to €25 billion for the effective penetration of RES in its energy mix.
EL_211	13	Greece is on track to exploit them with the aim of covering 70% of electricity production in 2030 from 40% in 2021.
EL_211	14	At the same time, with Greece's planned electrical interconnections with Balkan and Mediterranean countries worth around €7 billion, the country's ability to import and export electricity is estimated to triple over the next decade.
EL_211	15	Investment opportunities are also created in a second category of interconnections involving natural gas, creating the conditions for Greece to become a hub for the transmission of economic green energy.
EL_211	16	Based on the above, the significant impact on consumption from increased efficiency, combined with investments in renewable energy production and international interconnections (totalling €35 billion) will enable the transition to a green energy mix.
EL_213	1	Noise from ship refuelling threatens penguins in South Africa
EL_213	2	The already endangered African penguin is being removed from its natural habitat off the east coast of South Africa due to noise from ship refuelling, according to a scientific study.
EL_213	3	The number of African penguins on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay, once the largest breeding colony of birds in the world, has declined significantly since South Africa began allowing ships in the area to refuel at sea six years ago.
EL_213	4	This bay is located in a busy shipping lane along the east coast of South Africa.
EL_213	5	It is rich in marine and avifauna and protected whales can be found in its waters.
EL_213	6	We found that noise levels, which were already high, have doubled, said Lorien Pichegru, deputy director of the Institute of Coastal and Marine Research at Nelson Mandela University, who led the study.
EL_213	7	High noise levels affect the ability of marine animals to find and capture prey, communicate or navigate properly.
EL_213	8	This year we have just 1,200 breeding pairs on St. Croix from 8,500 pairs in 2016, a nearly 85 percent decline since marine refueling began, Pichegru said.
EL_213	9	He stated that dead birds are spotted every month on every beach in the bay.
EL_213	10	The new study, published on 10 August in the journal Science of the Total Environment, is the first to investigate the impact of noise pollution from marine traffic on a seabird and the effects of offshore fueling activities.
EL_213	11	The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) in 2016 granted the country's first offshore fuel licence to Aegean Marine in a controversial closed tender and then granted two successive licences to SA Marine Fuels and Heron Marine in 2018 and 2019.
EL_213	12	The companies did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
EL_213	13	The moratorium on new authorisations, in force since August 2019, will only be lifted once the environmental impact assessment by the port authorities has been completed.
EL_213	14	The evaluation is expected next year, a SAMSA official said.
EL_213	15	The Nelson Mandela University study used vessel identification tool data to estimate underwater noise from ships as a proxy for underwater ambient noise in the area.
EL_213	16	In 2019, penguins were found with oil in Algoa Bay after an oil spill from a refueling.
EL_213	17	Because of the supply at sea, penguins also find it difficult to breed.

EL_221	1	12th day of protests for Mahsha Amini in Iran -
EL_221	2	Former President Rafsanjani's daughter arrested
EL_221	3	For the 12th consecutive night, Iranians took to the streets yesterday Tuesday in many cities across the country to protest the death of Mahsha Amini after her arrest by vice police, despite a bloody crackdown.
EL_221	4	"Ignoring international appeals not to resort to violence, the Iranian authorities continue to deal with the protesters, whom they describe as ""rioters"" who ""damage security and public property"", with an iron fist."
EL_221	5	Demonstrations take place every night after 16 September, the day on which 22-year-old Amini died, three days after she was arrested in Tehran for not wearing her headscarf properly.
EL_221	6	According to opposition media based outside Iran, the demonstrations resumed last night in several cities.
EL_221	7	But activists have complained that problems with internet access make it more difficult to transmit images.
EL_221	8	A video posted by the opposition Manoto television network shows a woman without a headscarf waving her hands in the air in Tehran's Narmak district.
EL_221	9	According to images reported by London-based Iran International TV, in Sanandaz, the capital of Kurdistan province, where Amini was from, women threw away their headscarves, while in Shiraz a man burned a photograph of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
EL_221	10	Arrest of daughter of former president
EL_221	11	"According to the latest report released yesterday by the Iranian Fars agency, ""about 60 people have been killed"" since 16 September."
EL_221	12	The police said 10 people died in their ranks, but it is not clear whether these are included in the 60 deaths.
EL_221	13	"The Oslo-based NGO Iran Human Right (IHR) announced on Monday the death of ""at least 76 people"", including ""six women and four children"", noting that it had obtained ""videos and death certificates confirming the use of real bullets against protesters""."
EL_221	14	"Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was arrested in Tehran yesterday for ""inciting rioters to demonstrate"", Tasnim news agency reported."
EL_221	15	Videos have shown in recent days police beating protesters with batons and students tearing up large photographs of Khamenei and his predecessor Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.
EL_234	1	Turkey's Foreign Ministry suspended nine honorary consuls for criticizing the Erdogan government
EL_234	2	In a surprise decision, Turkey's foreign ministry suspended the honorary consuls of nine countries from their posts because, some of them claimed, they had criticised the Erdogan government through social media posts.
EL_234	3	Among the official consuls who were dismissed from their posts without an official explanation from the Turkish Foreign Ministry last month - include those of Sweden in Antalya, Britain in Mugla, Belgium and Austria in Izmir, Romania in Alexandretta and Lithuania in Nevsehir, the Turkish DW service reported.
EL_234	4	The issue surfaced days ago - in the wake of the recent crisis with Erdogan's threat to expel the ambassadors of ten Western countries who called for the release of imprisoned Turkish businessman and activist Osman Kavala - when Sweden's consulate in Istanbul issued a statement noting that it would temporarily close the country's consulate in Antalya due to the Turkish authorities' demand to terminate the mandate to the honorary consul, Neil Sayir, who has represented Sweden in the region for many years.
EL_234	5	"Sayir herself, a lawyer and wife of a founding member of Meral Aksener's opposition ""Good Party"" (Iyi Parti), noted that her mandate was valid until 2023 and had recently been renewed and that the Swedish Foreign Ministry had tried to change the decision of the Turkish authorities, ""but unfortunately, in the specific political climate that everyone knows, there was no happy result""."
EL_234	6	He added that he will continue to demand a Turkey where the rule of law and human rights are respected.
EL_234	7	But another honorary consul who was removed from office told Al Monitor, without revealing his identity, that the reason for their dismissal was their criticism of the Erdogan government in speeches and social media posts.
EL_234	8	"""I know that at least some diplomatic delegations have asked the Turkish Foreign Ministry to reconsider its decision, but they have been told flatly 'no',"" he said."
EL_234	9	In the same vein, Austria's now former honorary consul in Izmir Mustafa Ulku Chaner - a lawyer and former member of the opposition Kemalist Republican People's Party - claimed that he was dismissed because of comments critical of government policy.
EL_234	10	The allegations that social media posts played a role in the decision come at a time when social media users in Turkey regularly face harassment, censorship and arrests for critical comments against the Turkish president and his government.
EL_236	1	Turkey: Court rejects Osman Kavala's appeal for release
EL_236	2	A high court in Istanbul has rejected an appeal by Osman Kavala's (Osman Kavala) lawyers as the philanthropist asked for his release, BirGün newspaper reported Friday.
EL_236	3	The lower court had ruled in favour of continuing Kavala's arrest on 27 November, in the last hearing of the combined case against journalist Can Dündar, actor couple Mehmet Ali and Ayşe Pınar Alabora, former representative of Open Society Foundations Turkey Gökçe Tüylüoğlu, novelist Meltem Arıkan.
EL_236	4	Civil Society Development Center advisor Hanzade Hikmet Germiyanoğlu and journalist and civil society activist İnanç Ekmekçi are accused of attempting to overthrow the government.
EL_236	5	Kavala was acquitted in a previous trial in February 2020 on the same charges, but a district court in Istanbul overturned the decision.
EL_236	6	In April, the Kavala case was combined with that against seven human rights defenders for their alleged involvement in the Gezi protests.
EL_236	7	Taking its name from the park in which it started, the 2013 Gezi Protests began as a small sit-in to defend one of the last green spaces in the centre of Istanbul.
EL_236	8	They quickly evolved into national anti-government demonstrations that continued for months, eventually drawing four million people onto the streets.
EL_236	9	Kavala is accused of organizing and financing the protests and separately faces espionage charges for them.
EL_236	10	"The philanthropist's continued arrest ""works to keep alive the perception that I am somehow a criminal,"" Kavala told Mehmet Emin İlbeyli of Independent Turkish in an interview published Thursday."
EL_236	11	The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has issued several judgments calling for Kavala's immediate release.
EL_236	12	"He said the charges against him were ""politically motivated""."
EL_236	13	Turkey has refused to comply with the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, which led the Council of Europe to open infringement proceedings against the country.
EL_236	14	The decision is a first step for the Council to take disciplinary action against Turkey, including suspension of voting rights and possible expulsion.
EL_236	15	The deadline for Turkey to inform the Council of Europe on how it will comply with the decision is 19 January, two days after Kavala's next hearing.
EL_236	16	"The proceedings ""are a recognition of the damage to the rule of law in the country and therefore have implications that will indirectly affect the economy,"" Kavala told İlbeyli."
EL_236	17	"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has personally targeted Kavala on several occasions, most recently calling the philanthropist a ""Soros scion"", referring to Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros."
EL_236	18	"On Wednesday, the president also said Turkey would not recognise ""European Union decisions"" on Kavala or Selahatin Demirtash, the former co-chairman of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition People's Democratic People's Party (HDP), who has been behind bars since 2016; it is also a European Court of Human Rights ruling calling for Demirtash's immediate release."
EL_236	19	"Erdogan's claims of Kavala's collaboration with Soros to overthrow the Turkish government ""are not based on concrete information or evidence,"" Kavala said."
EL_236	20	"""Lately, the president has been explaining the economic woes with foreign attacks,"" he added."
EL_236	21	"""I think this sends a message that those who collaborate with foreign powers against the government will be punished and that no law or the European Court of Human Rights would give them any protection."""
EL_236	22	The philanthropist believes his prosecution will demonstrate how vital an independent judiciary is to democracies.
EL_236	23	Once released from prison, Kavala plans to prioritise raising awareness of universal standards of justice and continue his work in civil society.
EL_237	1	Mallorca: How does tourism affect climate change?
EL_237	2	The tourism model , as it has been developed, has disastrous consequences for the environment says Zaume Adrover , representative of the environmental group Terraferida, as reported by Deutsche Welle.
EL_237	3	"""Few places contribute to global warming like Mallorca,"" he says."
EL_237	4	In the last 20 years, 100 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide have been released into the atmosphere due to air traffic in Mallorca alone.
EL_237	5	But the Spanish island is an extreme example.
EL_237	6	Food is also an important factor as tourists, because of the amenities offered by hotels, consume foods that produce more emissions, such as meat.
EL_237	7	The German Hotel and Restaurant Association has pointed out for years that 17 to 50 kg of carbon dioxide per night and per visitor, depending on the category of accommodation.
EL_237	8	For example, in a 5-star hotel, per capita water consumption reaches 522 litres per day.
EL_237	9	The cruise industry should also make corresponding reductions.
EL_237	10	The Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) believes that while individual pilot projects offer hope, the industry as a whole is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement's climate change targets in time.
EL_237	11	"""We can't go on like this"" The tourism industry has made it clear that the period of carefree holidays is over."
EL_237	12	"""We cannot go on like this"", said recently Norbert Fibich, president of the German Travel Association (DRV)."
EL_237	13	"Air travel is the ""Achilles heel"" of the industry and therefore the goal is a CO2 neutral mobility footprint."
EL_237	14	The World Tourism Organization is committed to doing so because of the 60% increase in CO2 emissions from 2005 to 2016, according to figures presented at COP26.
EL_237	15	At the 2021 UN Conference on Climate Change, over 600 representatives of the tourism industry signed the so-called Glasgow Declaration, committing themselves to becoming climate neutral by 2050 at the latest, a far from easy process.
EL_237	16	In the near future, at least, no substantial change is expected in the global aviation industry.
EL_237	17	"""Progress in this area is so slow that there are serious doubts about the feasibility of the aviation industry's zero emissions target by 2050,"" criticises the Transport & Environment think tank."
EL_237	18	Alternative fuels for air transport are not a realistic option as it is currently not feasible to produce this type of fuel on a large scale, while at the same time the number of flights is increasing year by year.A sustainable solution to reduce CO2 emissions at the moment is to minimise flights.
EL_237	19	The solution to the problem in Mallorca is complex.
EL_237	20	Tourism researcher Wolfgang Strassdas brings to light another problem.
EL_237	21	With a quick glance on the internet, one can find flights from Germany to Mallorca for as little as 140 euros return for the month of August.
EL_237	22	This price is too cheap, says the researcher, and does not reflect the real costs.
EL_237	23	Tickets should reflect real costs and proposes to reduce the tax advantages of the aviation industry and to introduce a CO2 emissions trading scheme.
EL_237	24	He therefore believes that a large proportion will no longer be able to travel to Mallorca by air.
EL_237	25	The researcher goes on to recommend alternative forms of tourism, for example travelling by train to the Mediterranean or taking a holiday in the Baltic Sea.
EL_237	26	Zaume Androver expresses his concerns on the other side about the future of the island.
EL_237	27	The current investment plans for the operation of the airport involve some €200 million in modernisation measures at Palma alone.
EL_237	28	His suspicions of expanding the airport's capacity dashes his hopes for fewer visitors to the island.
EL_247	1	The failed energy policy of the Mitsotakis government: LNG but in the far future...
EL_247	2	"It seems that the Mitsotakis government has not understood or does not want to understand the problems that have been created for the Greek people by its energy policy, as the Greeks from the inability to pay the incredible electricity bills are in danger of living the time of the Athenians during the period of ""Cylthian Agos"", when due to debts they became... slaves."
EL_247	3	Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis promises that Greece will not only replace natural gas from Russian sources, but will also become an energy gateway for the Balkans, for all of Southeastern Europe!
EL_247	4	And in this direction, what did it show? Inaugurations of maces and announcements of LNG storage stations which have not yet been designed and will of course be built in the distant... future.
EL_247	5	Until then, how will the Greek survive? Without Russian natural gas? Greece imports 39% of its natural gas from Russia and cannot be replaced by a model that was inaugurated yesterday in Alexandroupolis (in the presence of three Balkan Prime Ministers, Skopje's Dimitar Kovachevski, Bulgaria's Kiril Petkov and Serbia's Aleksandar Vucic, as well as the President of the European Council Charles Michel) by Mr.Mitsotakis, as the official start of the implementation of the new LNG terminal in the sea area off Alexandroupolis.
EL_247	6	"In fact, the government says that the Alexandroupolis plant is the first step in receiving and storing LNG, while a second station off Alexandroupolis and a floating plant off Corinth are planned, ""infrastructure that, when fully developed, will give Greece a gasification capacity of 58,500,000 cubic meters of gas per day"", as Mr."
EL_247	7	Mitsotakis.
EL_247	8	"What is it about all this that strikes you as strange? But the use of the verb ""plan"" and the future participle ""WILL""."
EL_247	9	"Between the plan, the ""IF"" and the implementation there is a clearly long period of time."
EL_247	10	According to the government, the Alexandroupolis floating station includes tanks with a capacity of about 153,500 cubic metres of LNG and is estimated to have the capacity to supply the National Natural Gas Transmission System with about 5.5 billion cubic metres of fuel per year.
EL_247	11	The plant is scheduled to be commissioned in late 2023 and will contribute to increasing LNG storage capacity in Greece, in addition to the Revithoussa plant, which currently has a capacity of 225,000 cubic meters of LNG.
EL_247	12	"Apart from the fact that these stations are far from being created, Mr Mitsotakis will have to answer how these stations will be ""filled""."
EL_247	13	From American LNG? Assuming there is enough (which there isn't), who will pay the very expensive cost of it? The Greek citizens again?
EL_248	1	Outside diplomatic boundaries, the Azerbaijani ambassador in Athens vulgarly attacks his Armenian colleague
EL_248	2	When you are the official diplomatic representative of a dictatorial regime like Azerbaijan, you show it with every action you take, and in the most brutal and vulgar way.
EL_248	3	You don't even follow the basic rules of diplomacy.
EL_248	4	So does the Azerbaijani ambassador in Athens Anar Huseynov , who is not even able to keep up appearances.
EL_248	5	He publicly attacks in a boyish manner on social media his fellow diplomat, Ambassador of Armenia Mr.
EL_248	6	Tigran Mkrtchyan.
EL_248	7	This gentleman, the head of the Azerbaijani embassy in Athens, took the post of the Ambassador of the Republic of Armenia and wrote a vulgar and off-the-record response.
EL_248	8	"The Armenian ambassador says in his own post: ""Hopefully, all those who spread misinformation about Armenia will apologize unless they are in the service of Azerbaijan and its dictator"" The Azerbaijani ambassador replied: The press representing the aggressor country in Greece and the country that still has territorial claims against its neighbors seems to have completely lost its mind in pursuing personal interests."
EL_248	9	As for Ukraine, the world knows your position.
EL_248	10	So this gentleman calls the country that was and is still being attacked by Azerbaijan an aggressor, in order to satisfy the plans of their patron and instigator of the war in Karabakh, Tayyip Erdogan.
EL_248	11	They speak of territorial claims by those whose existence as a tribe is not mentioned in any historical period beyond 100 years.
EL_248	12	Those who seek to expel the natives from the historical Armenian homeland and also cultivate in every way in their minds the idea of occupying all Armenian lands are daring and speaking.
EL_248	13	Those who, as instant criminals, threaten at every opportunity that they will carry out a total genocide of the Armenians, in order to wipe them off the face of the earth once and for all, in order to get rid of this people whose existence and culture so disturbs them.
EL_248	14	Especially the Armenian civilization, where in every comparison between them the Azeris show a complete lack of any trace of civilization, which is why they commit such atrocities and destroy every Armenian cultural monument.
EL_248	15	You see it is the inferiority complex of an uncivilized people, behaving like a third world country, with a nouveau riche ruling class and leadership.
EL_248	16	The Azeris are overtly appearing as real pirates in the Caucasus region, having of course the backs of Turkey and directly threatening anyone who stands in the way of their grandiose expansionist plans that they and their Turkish partners have set out to implement, for the spread of pan-Turkism in the region.
EL_248	17	Let the international community open its eyes and see who the Azeris are when they throw off the mask of a supposedly modern and democratic country and especially when they show their true face, which is none other than that of a bully and a terrorist.
EL_253	1	NASA: Tomorrow night mankind will attempt to divert an asteroid from its course
EL_253	2	On Monday night, humanity will attempt to divert an asteroid from its course by firing a car-sized spacecraft, the US space agency's (NASA) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), at it as if it were a rocket.
EL_253	3	The $330 million, 550-kilogram cubic-shaped robotic spacecraft DART, after travelling a distance of about 11 million kilometres from Earth, from where it was launched in November 2021, is destined to crash - at 02:14 GMT on Tuesday 27 September - into the small satellite Dimorph (160 metres in diameter) of the larger asteroid Gemini (about 780 metres in diameter).
EL_253	4	"It is the first critical ""rehearsal"" of planetary defence in case such a space rock poses a threat to Earth in the future."
EL_253	5	This is the first test of a technology to deflect/deflect a potentially catastrophic asteroid.
EL_253	6	The DART spacecraft's impact with the asteroid at a speed of about 22 000 km per hour will be designed to use kinetic energy to slightly deflect it from its orbit.
EL_253	7	Something similar may need to be done in the future with another large asteroid whose orbit risks crossing that of our planet.
EL_253	8	"The ""bombardment"" of Gemmorus - which will lead to the destruction of DART - is expected to alter its orbit slightly (by about 1%), so that it will orbit around Gemini a little closer and faster."
EL_253	9	Telescopes from Earth will be watching to see if this actually happened.
EL_253	10	At the same time, DART has already released on 11 September the small (14 kg) Italian-made LICIACube spacecraft, which will approach Dimorph at a distance of 55 km and will use its cameras to photograph the effects of the impact.
EL_253	11	The event will also be monitored by several ground-based and space-based telescopes, including the James Webb.
EL_253	12	Following in the footsteps of the US mission will be the European HERA mission of the European Space Agency (ESA), which will send a German-built spacecraft, accompanied by two microsatellites (the Milani and Juventas cubesats), to Gemini and Dimorphus to study them more closely and see first-hand the crater that will have been created, as well as the other effects of the DART impact.
EL_253	13	HERA is expected to be launched in 2024 and reach the asteroid and its moon at the end of 2026.
EL_253	14	If DART fails to find its target, it has enough fuel to have another chance after two years to repeat its attempt on another space rock.
EL_253	15	The mission is led by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
EL_253	16	NASA has found more than 27,000 asteroids of various sizes, whose orbits bring them close to Earth.
EL_253	17	Despite advances in the detection of asteroids that occasionally approach our planet, so far astronomers estimate that only 30% to 40% of near-Earth objects larger than 140 metres in diameter have been detected.
EL_253	18	This is why it has been understood that a planetary defence technology must be in place in case of a nasty surprise from above, such as that of the 10-kilometre-diameter asteroid Chixulub that fell in what is now Mexico and probably wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.
EL_253	19	However, if humanity ever - by all means - needs to pull a very large asteroid out of its path, like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, the spacecraft that crashes into it will probably carry a nuclear bomb or other powerful explosive.
EL_253	20	In any case, the risk of needing such a planetary defence mission is very small (though not zero) at least for the next century, according to NASA's calculations.
EL_253	21	China is preparing a similar planetary defence mission to the asteroid Benu in 2026.
EL_262	1	Exit from the enhanced surveillance regime: A new era in the Greek economy
EL_262	2	The Greek economy is entering a new era, after 12 years of strict surveillance by the institutions, and Greece is no longer the exception in Europe.
EL_262	3	The long-awaited exit of the country from the enhanced supervision regime announced today by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, brings the definitive end to the era of memoranda.
EL_262	4	Greece will be able to freely exercise its economic policy, with priorities determined only by the government of the day and not by Brussels, while the recovery of the investment grade -which the Prime Minister has referred to extensively in the past for its importance- is now visible within 2023 or earlier.
EL_262	5	From now on, economic policy will focus on creating fiscal space through GDP growth and permanent revenue growth, which will be used to finance citizen support measures such as Fuel Pass, Power Pass, ENFIA reduction and other tax cuts.
EL_262	6	Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke of a historic day, a long period that brought pain to citizens, a stagnant economy and division in society.
EL_262	7	"""Now a new, clear horizon of growth, unity and prosperity for all is emerging"", were the Prime Minister's words."
EL_262	8	"""The 20th of August 2022 is a historic day for Greece and the Greeks: in the most official way, our country exits from the Enhanced European Supervision regime."
EL_262	9	This ends a twelve-year cycle that has brought pain to citizens, stagnation to the economy and division in society.
EL_262	10	"But for a new, clear horizon of growth, unity and prosperity for all to emerge."""
EL_262	11	"""Greece today is a different Greece."
EL_262	12	It shows high growth and a big drop in unemployment, already down 3 points from last year and 5 from 2019.
EL_262	13	At the same time, its citizens are now exempt or relieved from many taxes imposed during the stone age.
EL_262	14	Everybody pays less contributions and almost everybody pays lower ENFIA.
EL_262	15	The minimum wage increased by €63.
EL_262	16	"And the weakest are being supported in a targeted way"", the Prime Minister noted."
EL_262	17	Greece's exit from the enhanced surveillance regime was also commented positively by senior EU officials.
EL_262	18	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Eurogroup President Pascal Donahue and European Council President Charles Michel welcomed Greece's exit from the regime, immediately after the Greek Prime Minister's message.
EL_262	19	This development has multiple benefits for the country: It closes, together with the early repayment of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the lifting of capital restrictions, a painful chapter for Greece.
EL_262	20	It strengthens the country's position in international markets.
EL_262	21	It provides an additional boost to our country's growth potential and to attract investment.
EL_262	22	It gives degrees of freedom to conduct economic policy, within the framework of the rules that apply to all European Member States.
EL_262	23	It demonstrates the momentum that the Greek economy has gained as, despite unprecedented external difficulties, the country is achieving the targets it has set.
EL_271	1	FAZ: Merkel promised support to Greece on the refugee issue
EL_271	2	"""The refugee issue concerns us all and we cannot leave Greece alone,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during her visit to Athens, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports in a front-page article."
EL_271	3	"""Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Greece support in dealing with the refugee crisis during the second day of talks in Athens, the FAZ writes, adding: ""The refugee issue is an issue that concerns us all."
EL_271	4	"Germany is constantly making it clear that we cannot leave Greece alone,"" Merkel said on Friday after her meeting with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos."
EL_271	5	He knows how difficult the situation is in the overcrowded refugee camps on the islands of the Eastern Aegean, near the Turkish coast.
EL_271	6	"Germany has consistently supported a common refugee and asylum policy in the EU, ""to which everyone must make their own contribution"", Merkel said."
EL_271	7	According to Athens, there are about 14,000 migrants on the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to data from Athens.
EL_271	8	Especially, in Lesvos and Samos, non-decent living conditions prevail.
EL_271	9	"They would be avoided if the Greek asylum authorities implemented their role, as foreseen in the ""Agreement on Refugees"" agreed in 2016 between the EU and Turkey, and had sufficient staff to take quick decisions."
EL_271	10	"Pavlopoulos praised the fact that at the height of the migration crisis Merkel showed ""great courage"" and demonstrated her role as a European leader."
EL_271	11	In addition, Pavlopoulos reiterated Athens' demand for the payment of war reparations for the years of occupation during World War II, an amount that amounts to at least 289 billion euros, according to data from a committee of the Greek Parliament.
EL_271	12	Greece was attacked first by Mussolini's Italy in October 1940 and six months later, when its troops were ready to retreat, by Hitler's Germany and Bulgaria, and then was occupied by the three countries.
EL_271	13	Moreover, due to the naval blockade by the British, the winter of 1940-41 was followed by a great famine, mainly in Athens, with tens of thousands of victims.
EL_271	14	More victims came from the atrocities of the Wehrmacht and the SS.
EL_271	15	"Regarding the presentation of Pavlopoulos, Merkel said: ""We know how much Greece suffered during the Nazi period."""
EL_271	16	However, it did not acknowledge the claim for damages.
EL_271	17	She emphasized, however, the relationship of trust between herself and the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
EL_271	18	"They learned ""to work well together, even when they represented completely different positions in terms of content"", the FAZ also writes."
EL_272	1	Climate change may make much of Siberia habitable
EL_272	2	Large parts of Asian Russia may become more hospitable and habitable by the end of this century because of climate change, according to a new Russian-American scientific study.
EL_272	3	Researchers from the Russian Federal Research Centre in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, and the US National Aerospace Institute in Virginia, led by Dr Elena Parfenova, who published the paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters, examined various climate scenarios and the potential for opening up new possibilities for human settlement in Siberia and wider Asian Russia.
EL_272	4	This region, which stretches east from the Urals to the Pacific Ocean, covers an area of 13 million square kilometres and makes up 77% of Russia's land area.
EL_272	5	However, only 27% of the country's current population live there and they are mainly concentrated in the southern zone, where the climate is somewhat milder and the soil more fertile.
EL_272	6	"""Previous human migrations were related to climate change,"" said Parfenova."
EL_272	7	"""We wanted to find out whether, if in the future the climate changes again, it could lead to the most inhospitable areas of Asian Russia becoming more habitable for people."""
EL_272	8	The study predicts that by the end of the 21st century temperatures in Siberia and the surrounding region - depending on how severe climate change has become - will have risen by 3.4 to 9.1 degrees Celsius in winter and 1.9 to 5.7 degrees in summer, while rainfall will increase by 60 to 140 millimetres.
EL_272	9	"""Our simulations showed that, under the most extreme scenario of carbon dioxide increase and climate change, by the 2080s Asian Russia will have a milder climate and less permanent ice cover, from 65% of its current area to 40%,"" said Dr Parfenova."
EL_272	10	If a milder climate change scenario prevails in the coming decades, it is still estimated that the ability of people to settle and live will be improved by at least an additional 15% of the currently inhospitable area.
EL_272	11	"""Asian Russia today is too cold."
EL_272	12	"In a future warmer climate, however, food security, in terms of the ability to spread and yield agricultural crops, is likely to favour supporting human settlements,"" the Russian scientist said, urging Russian authorities to help in a timely manner through investments in infrastructure and agriculture."
EL_272	13	"""Huge swathes of Siberia and the Far East now have underdeveloped infrastructure."
EL_272	14	In the future, the areas with the most developed infrastructure and the greatest agricultural potential will obviously be the first to be populated.
EL_272	15	"How quickly this will happen will depend on the decisions taken on the necessary investments,"" he said."
EL_281	1	Freedom Ride: Mitsotakis should have cancelled the meeting with Trump
EL_281	2	"""Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is preparing to meet US President Donald Trump in a few hours."
EL_281	3	"In his luggage he offers as a ""gift"", among other things, the fresh agreement on the EastMed pipeline, which was signed 5 days ago in Athens and was advertised to Greek citizens as an agreement for ""development, stability and security"", while it is an act of subservient implementation of the US-Germany-Israel plans, to the detriment of our national interests and our international obligations, especially the obligation to respect Peace and Human Rights."
EL_281	4	Donald Trump, 4 days ago, ordered the cold-blooded and planned assassination of the Iranian General Suleymani, and publicly claimed responsibility for this crime, while 2 days ago he publicly announced via twitter that he has premeditated the commission of dozens of additional international crimes in Iran, including the destruction of the country's cultural heritage.
EL_281	5	The primitive way in which Trump publicly brags about committed and planned crimes against humanity, war crimes and acts of genocide, demands a strong reaction and disapproval from every person who believes in the principles of civilisation, humanity and justice and every state bound by the principles of the rule of law.
EL_281	6	"From every person and every state that understands the meaning of the ""Never Again"" commitment that Humanity made after World War II."
EL_281	7	"Eleftherias considers that, after Trump's specific actions and statements, Mitsotakis should have cancelled the much-publicised meeting and not come to it as a beggar and supplicant, seeking favour and offering ""gifts"", which will prove to be extremely damaging for our country."
EL_281	8	Greece is a member country of the International Criminal Court and is committed to the fight against international crimes.
EL_281	9	The Greek Government cannot be expected to reward the commission and direct threat of the most heinous crimes known to mankind, nor can it remain unaffected by such serious acts and statements, pretending that it has not been informed of them.
EL_281	10	The abandonment of the principles of international justice, international law and human rights and the exercise of foreign policy by fiat can only bring suffering to our country.
EL_281	11	"The logic of ""sign everything, consent to everything and give up rights, begging for handouts"" exposes our country to real dangers."
EL_281	12	The East Med pipeline implicates Greece and Cyprus in Trump's dangerous US plans in the Middle East.
EL_281	13	To the detriment of the long-suffering people of illegally occupied Palestine, the Agreement opens up European markets to Israeli gas, something that the belligerent and internationally accountable government of the reprehensible Netanyahu has so far been unable to achieve.
EL_281	14	The billions that the State of Israel will receive will be used to finance new armaments to commit new international crimes against the Palestinian people.
EL_281	15	The signing of this agreement is a development of entanglement, with unclear aspects, economic, geopolitical and international-political, linked to instability and insecurity in the region and complicating instead of solving the major regional problems of the Eastern Mediterranean - the Cyprus problem, the Aegean issues, the Syrian, Palestinian, Kurdish and Libyan civil war.
EL_281	16	All this, at a historic moment when, in the most blatant and crude way, the basic UN constitutional principles for the international peaceful coexistence of states are being questioned, i.e. the principles on which Greece (like Cyprus) is looking forward to and on which it should rely to repel Erdogan's threatening statements and illegal actions in the Aegean Sea and in the Cypriot EEZ.
EL_281	17	"In this context, the holding of the forthcoming meeting, under the pretext that it will supposedly ""ensure our protection from Turkey"" is an example of a complete lack of national strategy, and the substitution of foreign policy by short-sighted communication tactics."
EL_281	18	"It is, unfortunately, another mockery of the Greek people and another attempt to deceive them."""
EL_286	1	Mitarakis: The government has a concrete plan to deal with the migration issue
EL_286	2	The Minister was in Ioannina in response to the invitation from the PED of Epirus, in order to listen to the local authorities and discuss the parameters of the migration crisis.
EL_286	3	The Minister acknowledged that it is the responsibility of the state to achieve the reduction of the flows and the impact on local communities, and pointed out that the burden of the crisis is currently borne by 5 islands.
EL_286	4	"The minister stressed that ""we have a very specific plan to deal with the issue"", and announced that ""within the month, a Commander will be appointed by the Ministry of Immigration, who will take control of all the centres that are operating""."
EL_286	5	"Notis Mitarakis, asked the Mayors ""help where they can assist"", saying: ""Wherever you can play a primary role, manage funds and play a role in the local community."
EL_286	6	"It is the most positive message I would like to take back to Athens""."
EL_286	7	Addressing the Mayors, the Minister outlined the main priorities of the Ministry.
EL_286	8	"The 1st priority, as he said, is to work systematically to reduce flows and he continued: ""This requires."
EL_286	9	The relevant ministries have already taken many steps in terms of human and material support to increase surveillance to the limits allowed by international legislation.
EL_286	10	Speeding up the asylum process.
EL_286	11	Currently, 101 thousand asylum applications are pending.
EL_286	12	Tension on the islands has been created by the delay in the asylum process.
EL_286	13	7 months ago, the number was over 70 thousand.
EL_286	14	Despite the large flows that occurred in the second 6 months of 2019, we managed to respond and the increase in pending applications is small.
EL_286	15	From 1-1-2020, the Law is implemented, which gives us the possibility within a few weeks, to give new arrivals on the islands an asylum answer and we believe this will play a catalytic role in separating those who are entitled to asylum from those who are not entitled to international protection.
EL_286	16	Returns, to send the message that we are not a closed vineyard... I asked for the EU's help to open a direct line of return to Afghanistan and as a message of deterrence, to help in working with the Kabul government to return to Afghanistan those who are not entitled to international protection.
EL_286	17	The Afghan subject makes up 75% of the population in Moria.
EL_286	18	Controlled centres, so that we can solve security issues that have arisen on the islands and at the same time offer decent living conditions to asylum seekers.
EL_286	19	The current situation on the Aegean islands is something that no one can do justice to.
EL_286	20	The government's priority was to control the operation of NGOs.
EL_286	21	There are very good ones who played a catalytic role in managing the crisis and we thank them.
EL_286	22	There are also cases that do not meet the requirements of the Greek state, so now with the law that has been passed we will be able to separate them.
EL_286	23	The forthcoming new agreement on asylum, Dublin 3, to meet EU-wide burden-sharing rules.
EL_286	24	"European solidarity must be shown in practice... Today, we are experiencing and dealing with the aftermath of a migration policy of previous years."""
EL_286	25	The Ministry's second major priority is to reduce the impact of the migration crisis on local communities.
EL_286	26	Mr Mitarakis said:
EL_286	27	"""We voted to make it the responsibility of the State to cover the contribution fee on the structures that are operating."
EL_286	28	It is very important to clarify that this is not given as a trade-off, a reward to the municipality where a Facility is operating.
EL_286	29	That would be an insult to the TA.
EL_286	30	"It is given in recognition of the elementary responsibility of the State to cover the costs created by the fact that in some municipalities of the country and especially in our islands, there is a concentration of population beyond the permanent residents who pay their own contribution fee."""
EL_286	31	"Finally, the Minister pointed out that with the ""Solidarity"" programme and coordination of the whole Government, an effort is being made to address problems wherever they arise."
EL_289	1	Merkel: ESM is the right tool for the crisis
EL_289	2	Germany's long-standing position against Eurobonds was reiterated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in her statements after the European Council, which was held yesterday, again by teleconference.
EL_289	3	Regarding coronavirus, he asked for the patience of citizens, stressing that it is still too early to talk about easing restrictions.
EL_289	4	"""I believe that with the European Stability Mechanism we have a crisis tool that opens up many possibilities, which do not call into question our fundamental principles,"" Merkel said during an online press conference after the summit."
EL_289	5	However, she warned that the economic consequences of the koruna crisis would be more severe than those of the 2008 crisis and referred to the finance ministers, who were given the responsibility to present their proposals within two weeks.
EL_289	6	The Chancellor praised the European Commission for its speed and flexibility in designing and implementing relief measures for Member States and made special mention of the initiative to provide protective equipment for nursing staff, which she said would help smaller countries in particular.
EL_289	7	He also referred to the practical solidarity of European countries in this difficult period.
EL_289	8	He pointed out that Germany has taken care of patients from France and Italy, and that European countries systematically facilitate the repatriation of their partner countries' citizens.
EL_289	9	"Merkel said she was ""relieved"" about the imminent start of EU accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, and asked the European Commission to allow Germany to receive minor refugees from Greece as soon as possible, because, she said, ""every day counts""."
EL_289	10	"Responding to a question about the duration of the measures to ""limit contacts"" of citizens, the Chancellor insisted that ""we are not yet at the point of talking about relaxation"", as their effectiveness has not yet been judged."
EL_289	11	"""I really have to ask people in Germany to be patient,"" he said."
EL_289	12	As for her daily routine - since last Sunday she has been under preventive quarantine at home, after contacting her doctor who later tested positive for coronavirus - Mrs.
EL_289	13	"Merkel said she is ""very busy"" but admitted that she lacks personal contact with her colleagues, especially in the cabinet, which she now attends by telephone."
EL_294	1	Boris Johnson's father rents the villa in Pelion:
EL_294	2	How much is charged per week
EL_294	3	According to a report in the Daily Mail, Stanley Johnson, who has a villa in Pelion, spends his holidays and rents it to tourists for 2,100 British pounds a week.
EL_294	4	In fact, this year he is going to make 17,000 pounds from his villa in Greece, about 19,000 euros, as bookings are full until the end of September.
EL_294	5	However, when everyone was wondering about his journey from Britain to Greece, via Bulgaria, in the middle of the coronavirus, in early July Stanley Johnson had stated that he had come to Pelion on business.
EL_294	6	"""I am in Pelion on a necessary trip, trying to protect my property against the coronavirus."
EL_294	7	"I have to apply the necessary distancing measures, because they take it very seriously here,"" Stanley Johnson explained at the time."
EL_294	8	Stanley Johnson's villa in Pelion.
EL_294	9	According to Real Holidays, the company that manages Stanley Johnson's villa in Pelion, the property is booked for the next 2.5 months with data showing that there are bookings from July 18th until September 19th.
EL_294	10	"Johnson has named the house ""Villa Peace-a little place in the sun,"" and in fact, he says, the house has turned into much more than he could have imagined, with his children and grandchildren filling it with happy voices."
EL_294	11	Stanley Johnson, before handing over his villa to its summer tenants for about 19.000 euros, had a break from everyday life, saw his friends in Pelion and enjoyed the food in his favourite tavern.
EL_294	12	Every day he talks to neighbours and swims either in the pool or in the sea, which is a few metres from the house.
EL_294	13	In fact, his visit to Greece, which he says he loves, on 2 July was not the first time that Stanley Johnson had violated recommendations of the British government.
EL_294	14	Before the lockdown was implemented, he had said he would continue to go to pubs despite being in his 70s.
EL_294	15	"""Of course I'll go to a pub if I want to go to a pub."
EL_294	16	"Pub owners need people."""
EL_295	1	Filis to SKAI: Erdogan is very good at psychological warfare
EL_295	2	The Director of Research of the Institute of International Relations, Konstantinos Filis, spoke to SKAI about Turkish provocativeness, Erdogan's statements on Imia and the Russia-Turkey conflict in Syria.
EL_295	3	On Greek-Turkish relations, Konstantinos Filis said that Greece should not be worried about a new episode with Orucic Reyes.
EL_295	4	"""There are efforts to de-escalate the tension on both sides with the help of third parties because everyone understands that this situation, if maintained, could lead to a crisis that neither side nor the other side wants."
EL_295	5	The Oroots Race was a test.
EL_295	6	"In the near future we should not expect an equivalent of an Oruch Reyes,"" said the Director of Research at the Institute of International Relations."
EL_295	7	"On the statement by Tayyip Erdogan, who claimed that Turkey had warned Greece not to take actions that would create tension, on the day of the anniversary of the Imia, Konstantinos Filis said: ""The Turkish president wants to set the framework of any possible negotiation in the future and he wants to do so in suffocating terms for us."
EL_295	8	As a Turkish diplomat told me: But if you do something that will annoy us, we will answer five times.
EL_295	9	"This is the Turkish logic and philosophy."""
EL_295	10	"And he continued: ""President Erdogan is very good at psychological warfare."
EL_295	11	All his sentences seem to be carefully worded.
EL_295	12	We have no reason to attach more importance than is appropriate to such statements.
EL_295	13	"Greece is able to exercise its sovereign rights in an effective manner regardless of whether Turkey warns us that this is a nuisance."""
EL_295	14	"Referring to the presence of the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in block 8 of the Cyprus EEZ, Konstantinos Filis stressed that ""it is a show of force, a show of strength and an attempt by the French to separate their position from the EU, which is still under sanctions, which it has been discussing since last June and will be escalating."
EL_295	15	The French have at least three reasons, both historical and energy-related, because Total has a presence in the Cypriot EEZ.
EL_295	16	"The third reason is that France would certainly not want to see Turkey establishing itself militarily in the North African region, as it is trying to do in Libya and gaining a foothold there."""
EL_295	17	"Russia-Turkey ""quarrel"" in Idlib."
EL_295	18	"Regarding the climate of conflict between Turkey and Damascus in Idlib, the Director of Research of the Institute of International Relations said that it is a ""spat"" between Turkey and Russia that is not expected to escalate."
EL_295	19	"""It's a problematic situation because in Idlib 3.5 million people are trapped because if the fighting continues in the next few weeks we will have at least 1 million."
EL_295	20	Syrians who will want to cross the Turkish border.
EL_295	21	As far as the Russia-Turkey relationship is concerned, this is an episode, a little quarrel that I don't think will be followed up.
EL_295	22	I think that in the big picture for Putin, Erdogan is a very useful partner because he is disrupting the Western front, especially the NATO alliance with his erratic behaviour.
EL_295	23	"For Erdogan, Putin is a refuge which he uses against the West to say that if you further alienate me, I have other alternatives even if in practice this is not as true as both sides want to make it appear."""
EL_300	1	Almost 700 migrants crossed the Channel in one day in small boats
EL_300	2	Nearly 700 migrants crossed the English Channel on small boats to reach British shores yesterday, Monday, the highest number since the beginning of the year, according to the British Ministry of Defence.
EL_300	3	According to official figures, 696 people on 14 small boats were intercepted while making the dangerous crossing at one of the world's busiest spots, bringing the total to more than 17,000 since the start of the year.
EL_300	4	Faced with the scale of the phenomenon, the British government has signed an agreement with Rwanda to send asylum seekers arriving irregularly on British soil to the African country.
EL_300	5	Although none of these deportations have yet taken place -- a first flight was scheduled in June but was cancelled following a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) -- Boris Johnson's successor candidates, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, have both promised to implement this controversial policy.
EL_300	6	British MPs, in a recent report, considered that this measure is far from having the expected deterrent effect and called on London to negotiate with Paris to establish an asylum centre on French territory.
EL_300	7	MPs argue that crossings in the Channel on small boats will continue to increase significantly: 28,500 people arrived in the UK in 2021, a number they say could reach 60,000 by the end of the year.
EL_300	8	At least 166 people have lost their lives or are missing in their attempt to cross the Channel, including 27 in a single day in late 2021.
EL_300	9	According to a report in the Times yesterday, Home Secretary Priti Patel is preparing for the third year running to pay millions of pounds to France as part of an agreement between the French and British governments to deal with these crossings.
EL_300	10	A network suspected of trafficking over 10,000 migrants from the Middle East and East Africa from France to the UK in small inflatable boats over the last 12-18 months has recently been dismantled and 39 people have been arrested.
EL_300	11	This operation, carried out jointly by France, Germany, Belgium, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was described by Europol as the largest operation targeting a network using small boats.
EL_M_003	1	NATIONAL IDENTITY.
EL_M_003	2	Golden Dawn considers the attack of the economy and culture of globalisation as the main danger facing nations, due to the deliberate and insidious process of erosion of the national identity and identity of peoples.
EL_M_003	3	This attack uses the Trojan horse of illegal immigration.
EL_M_003	4	"This phenomenon reflects the worst aspects of Western civilization, as immigrants will become a new ""reserve"" of modern slaves, ready to accept wages and working conditions that are unacceptable for Greek workers."
EL_M_003	5	Golden Dawn proposes a comprehensive draft law for the immediate solution of the illegal immigration problem and the final crackdown on the slave trade, which turns the illegal crossing of the Greek borders by foreign citizens into a separate offence.
EL_M_003	6	Life imprisonment for all members of slave-trafficking rings arrested by the Greek authorities.
EL_M_003	7	"Unwavering defence of the rules on the acquisition of citizenship based on the ""law of blood"" (jus sanguinis)."
EL_M_003	8	"Immediately stop the current ""flow policy"" Strengthen the control of our maritime borders."
EL_M_003	9	"Census of ""non-community"" foreigners in our territory and granting residence permits only to those who meet the requirements."
EL_M_003	10	Any crime committed by a foreigner is an identical crime.
EL_M_003	11	The possibility for prisoners to serve their sentences in their country of origin, or alternatively, the possibility of compulsory unpaid work in special detention facilities, where work will be produced for the public sector.
EL_M_003	12	Immediate removal of all immigrants who have committed crimes on Greek territory.
EL_M_003	13	Crackdown on illegal trade by foreigners and strict tax control on remittances they send to their countries.
EL_M_003	14	To stop the huge loss of revenue for the Greek state.
EL_M_003	15	IT IS A NATIONAL NECESSITY : END ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION!
EL_M_003	16	FAMILY CARE AND DEMOGRAPHIC POLICY.
EL_M_003	17	The demographic problem is a mortal danger for Hellenism.
EL_M_003	18	Combined with massive illegal immigration, it means that in a few years we will be a minority in our own country.
EL_M_003	19	Golden Dawn considers the state's duties to be the defence of life (from conception to death), the protection of the family as a fundamental unit of society, and support for the growth of the population of the Greek people.
EL_M_003	20	The decline in the birth rate is a major contributor to the economic crisis and the ageing population.
EL_M_003	21	The state will quickly and actively focus on achieving a doubling of the population growth rate, at least by T.
EL_M_003	22	F.R. 3, 5%.
EL_M_003	23	The new tax measures of the coalition government hit the family, and are tangible proof of the ethnonationalism of the political system.
EL_M_003	24	Golden Dawn proposes: Repeal of Law 821 of 15/9/1978, which legalized abortion, and the introduction of heavy penalties for those who perform abortions.
EL_M_003	25	Conduct an information campaign on the serious harm that abortion can cause to women's physical and mental health.
EL_M_003	26	Abortions in Greece are 400,000 per year.
EL_M_003	27	In other words, every year an entire city like Patras is destroyed.
EL_M_003	28	Abortion is murder.
EL_M_003	29	Husbands become child killers instead of parents because they serve decay and death instead of giving life.
EL_M_010	1	Our plan.
EL_M_010	2	FOR LOWER TAXES AND HIGHER INCOME.
EL_M_010	3	A growing economy is an economy that provides more disposable income for all.
EL_M_010	4	With fairer taxation that unleashes productivity and creativity, so that every Greek can ensure the highest possible quality of life for himself and his family.
EL_M_010	5	For this purpose: Maintain the tax-free rate and reduce the introductory tax rate for individuals (employees, self-employed and farmers) from 22% to 9% for incomes up to €10,000 and introduce a new tax scale with a lower top tax rate.
EL_M_010	6	We are phasing out the business tax and the special solidarity contribution.
EL_M_010	7	We establish an increase in the minimum wage at twice the rate of GDP growth.
EL_M_010	8	We estimate that the minimum wage will thus reach €730 by 2022.
EL_M_010	9	We are gradually reducing contributions to the main pension from 20% to 15% over the next four years.
EL_M_010	10	We are reducing VAT by introducing two basic rates of 11% and 22%, from 13% and 24% today, while maintaining the over-reduced VAT rate at 6%.
EL_M_010	11	Our plan.
EL_M_010	12	ON LABOUR AND THE PROTECTION OF LABOUR RIGHTS.
EL_M_010	13	To turn the country around, with strong growth and social cohesion, we need a new social contract between workers, state and business.
EL_M_010	14	The state offers a good business environment and low taxes and companies are punctual in all their obligations, pay their employees well and make them stakeholders in the profits and growth of the business and take care of the environment.
EL_M_010	15	For this purpose: Incentivise the private sector by reducing taxes and simplifying bureaucratic procedures.
EL_M_010	16	We guarantee strict compliance with labour law by using e-government and carrying out targeted and more effective checks.
EL_M_010	17	We establish a white register of companies and lower contributions for companies that are socially compliant and respect labour legislation.
EL_M_010	18	We provide incentives for companies to give their employees additional benefits such as free transport to work, extra insurance benefits, profit-sharing and special share ownership schemes.
EL_M_010	19	Our plan.
EL_M_010	20	TO RESTORE THE VALUE OF GREEK PROPERTY.
EL_M_010	21	We reduce ENFIA by 30% within two years for all owners.
EL_M_010	22	We establish a 40-50% discount for all energy, functional and aesthetic upgrading, maintenance and utilization of buildings.
EL_M_010	23	People will spend the money, keep the invoices and have the tax credit that they can use to cover any tax liability over the next three years.
EL_M_010	24	We are drastically simplifying property transfer procedures, reducing the 23 documents initially by a third and ensuring that they will gradually all be available electronically.
EL_M_010	25	We suspend for three years the capital gains tax on the sale and purchase of real estate and VAT on construction activity.
EL_M_015	1	One of the main pillars of our nation is Education.
EL_M_015	2	For us Greeks, our education system plays an important role, both for the preservation of our tradition and for the development of our country.
EL_M_015	3	The Greek people, as the illuminator of modern Western civilization, are currently called upon, within a severe economic crisis, to confront the dismantling of Education by the governments of the day, which have led nowhere but to its deconstruction.
EL_M_015	4	Therefore, other measures and reforms are needed to improve our education system.
EL_M_015	5	ELLINIKI LYSI clearly defines through its proposals what kind of Education we want and how we can restore knowledge and learning to Greek children.
EL_M_015	6	He stresses that without solving the problems of the economy it is not easy to improve education, as is the case with all other public sectors.
EL_M_015	7	Also, that education, both secondary and higher education, must be linked to the professional careers of young people, so that it contributes to the economic development of the country.
EL_M_015	8	Our proposals promote the student's Spirit and Personality, while at the same time highlighting his/her abilities, skills, tendencies and talents.
EL_M_015	9	Primary and Secondary Education.
EL_M_015	10	"Beyond the general debate on the deterioration of school standards, a more thorough assessment can be derived from the PISA (""Programme for International Student Assessment"") competition."
EL_M_015	11	It takes place every three years in the 35 OECD member countries and measures performance in maths, science and reading comprehension.
EL_M_015	12	Although we do not take the results as a statute, as it has been questioned as to its content, the conclusions are interesting.
EL_M_015	13	On the basis of this test, however, it was found that Greece lags behind the OECD in text comprehension and mathematics.
EL_M_015	14	These are seen as the subjects of the future: critical thinking and science.
EL_M_015	15	Based on the 2018 results, only 6.2% of Greek students achieved very high performance in at least one subject, well below the OECD average of 15.7%, including Singapore 43.3% and Estonia 22.5%.
EL_M_015	16	Only 4% at the upper level in Mathematics and Reading Comprehension (OECD average: 11% and 9% respectively).
EL_M_015	17	Also, lower rates of 'A' students from disadvantaged backgrounds (rural, low income) and first and second generation migrants were observed.
EL_M_015	18	Also, spending on education in Greece is below the EU average both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP.
EL_M_015	19	Public expenditure per pupil in primary and secondary education is estimated at €3,466 per year, compared to an EU average of €6,269 based on 2017 Eurostat data.
EL_M_015	20	Public expenditure at primary level is 0.73% of GDP with an EU average of 0.97%, and at secondary level 0.68% of GDP with an EU average of 0.99%.
EL_M_015	21	To these must be added the extracurricular expenses (tutoring, activities, etc.) which are a significant expense for families in Greece.
EL_M_015	22	It is noted that 97% of pupils learn foreign languages in Greece compared to 59% on average in the EU.
EL_M_015	23	Increasing the teaching of foreign languages in primary school, when done at the expense of the rest of the programme, does not seem to be a solution.
EL_M_015	24	Therefore, there seems to be an issue of under-spending, especially when GDP has collapsed in recent years and when the number of students has not decreased accordingly.
EL_M_015	25	In this context and with these problems and challenges facing public education and society, the Government has promoted the increase in the number of model schools.
EL_M_015	26	At the same time, it freed private education from some of the operating restrictions imposed by the previous government, which we agreed to, to the extent that basic labour rights of teachers were protected.
EL_M_015	27	We are not against private education, which is also an international phenomenon.
EL_M_015	28	We understand that for better or worse some families will choose it, especially when the standard of public schooling is deteriorating.
EL_M_015	29	Most of the pupils in private education do not go to schools of the aristocracy but to schools for the middle class.
EL_M_015	30	But what we do not agree with is the creation of a two-tier education.
EL_M_015	31	We want public schools that are available to everyone not to fall short.
EL_M_024	1	We're sorry.
EL_M_024	2	To all those who have fought together in the workplaces, to those who fight together every day for the reorganization of the labour movement and other movements, against the unpopular government laws, the employer's terrorism, the undermining attitude of the employers' trade unionism.
EL_M_024	3	To those who question and oppose NATO and the EU, the war plans and the sanctions that are ultimately paid for by the people.
EL_M_024	4	Allying with the KKE is the most consistent stand against these choices, which the KKE has consistently warned against and organised resistance to.
EL_M_024	5	"To working-people's forces that have no confidence in the bourgeois parties, that see the rot bubbling up from every resource of the capitalist system, that in the polls on ""which of the present or tomorrow's would-be rulers can give an answer to the people's problems"", answer ""none""."
EL_M_024	6	"To the young people, who are living the best years of their lives in a constant ""crisis"": in the past with the memoranda, then with the pandemic, now with precision, war, insecurity for tomorrow."
EL_M_024	7	The totality of what we have been experiencing on a daily basis all these years illuminates the undeniable fact that within the limits of the capitalist system and this policy there can be no solution to the acute and constantly worsening people's problems.
EL_M_024	8	The KKE can lead the popular counter-attack.
EL_M_024	9	Because it has a programme that expresses the interests of the workers.
EL_M_024	10	This is proven by the daily action of its forces to repel unpopular choices and the relief of the workers.
EL_M_024	11	It is the real opposition today, paving the way for the way out for the benefit of the people.
EL_M_024	12	"It is a struggle that will exploit every difficulty and ""crack"" in the bourgeois political system, in order to move the people to better positions."
EL_M_024	13	The people's struggle, which targets the real opponent, the dictatorship of capital, can deepen these cracks even more, open the way to radical overthrow.
EL_M_024	14	We are not alone on this road.
EL_M_024	15	All over the world today there are promising resistances, pockets of struggle that show the potential for a workers' - people's awakening.
EL_M_024	16	We can.
EL_M_024	17	With a strong KKE, with a mass workers' - people's counterattack, we can pave the way for the overthrow, for radical changes in society and the economy, for our people to become one hour earlier the landlord of their land and their labour.
EL_M_024	18	To use all the modern possibilities of production, technology and science to satisfy the needs of the working people.
EL_M_024	19	The precondition is that energy, food, basic goods are not produced as commodities under the control of big business groups, but become social property, that scientific central planning is developed with the workers, the people at the helm of power.
EL_M_027	1	Against this gloomy situation, the struggles and mass mobilisations of the workers in many countries against the war and the involvement in it, against the excessive military armaments, against the consequences of energy poverty and poverty, against the attempt to put once again on the shoulders of the workers the bill of the war, of the sanctions on both sides, of the multifaceted support of capital, are a breath of hope and optimism.
EL_M_027	2	The system staffs are worried about the possibility that popular anger may acquire a radical content and orientation.
EL_M_027	3	The difficulties faced by more and more governments - centre-right, centre-left, liberal, social-democratic, etc. - show that the contradictions are sharpening, that not everything is immovable, that they are not all-powerful after all.
EL_M_027	4	On the contrary, possibilities can be created to shake the power of capital.
EL_M_027	5	"As long as the people trust in their power, to use these difficulties to their advantage and not to back down from their ""ball and chain"", the barbaric system will take another breath."
EL_M_027	6	The debate in Greece, too, about so-called political stability - regardless of how each bourgeois party understands it and how it pursues it - has as its main objective the unimpeded implementation of anti-people's policies.
EL_M_027	7	It is the other side of the repressive and authoritarian measures to manipulate the people.
EL_M_027	8	"It is ""stability"" for capital, ""instability"" and insecurity for the people."
EL_M_027	9	"Despite the heated debates and high tones, both the government of the New Democracy and SYRIZA, PASOK/KINAL, the other parties agree on the goal of ""stability"" on behalf of capital and compete on who can best guarantee it."
EL_M_027	10	"They talk about the need to ""ensure social cohesion"" and ""avoid tension""."
EL_M_027	11	"ND serves this goal through the pursuit of governmental self-reliance and its determination towards the people, SYRIZA through the well-known and bankrupt recipe of so-called ""democratic governments"" which -where they arise- follow the same path that leads to precision, poverty, war risks."
EL_M_027	12	"PASOK/KINAL is supported by centres of the economic and political establishment as a ""wild card"" for future unpopular government solutions."
EL_M_027	13	But the programme of the present or the next government - whatever it is called, whatever its composition - is already known.
EL_M_027	14	"It is the programme that will continue the policy of turning Energy into an expensive commodity in the context of the ""liberalised"" market."
EL_M_027	15	"It will continue to implement the strategy of the so-called green transition and ""energy liberalisation"", the main cause of energy poverty, which existed before the outbreak of the war."
EL_M_027	16	After all, it is the ND and SYRIZA governments that closed and devalued domestic production units, such as lignite.
EL_M_027	17	They introduced emissions trading, the Energy Exchange, green levies and indexation clauses.
EL_M_027	18	The people are paying and will continue to pay for a very expensive energy mix based on imported natural gas and now even more expensive American liquefied natural gas (LNG).
EL_M_027	19	"It is the program that will reproduce the precision that is a consequence of the sanctions against Russia, but also a result of the so-called extroversion, which sets the prices of domestic products on the basis of the international market, the notorious ""expansionist"" policy."
EL_M_027	20	All this came on top of the slashed workers' and people's income from the policy of the memoranda, which is constantly enriched with new anti-worker laws.
EL_M_027	21	It is the programme that will implement the commitments of the EU and the Recovery Fund.
EL_M_027	22	"The celebrations about the ""exit from enhanced supervision"" which supposedly marks the end of the memorandum era are a complete mockery!"
EL_M_027	23	"Not only because the unbearable burdens imposed on the Greek people over the last decade remain intact, but also because the famous ""normalcy of the EU"" is accompanied by permanent commitments and control mechanisms."
EL_M_027	24	"There are the preconditions of the Recovery Fund, which is the new ""super-memorandum"" at the expense of the peoples of Europe, and in addition to the ""special conditions"" brought about by the war and the coming crisis, with the people as victims."
EL_M_027	25	It is the programme that will implement the commitments of the Greek state towards NATO and the EU, as well as the military agreements with the US, France, etc.
EL_M_027	26	"They are commitments for the sake of the interests of Greek capital, which, through its role as ""standard-bearer"" in dangerous war plans, seeks its geopolitical and economic upgrading."
EL_M_027	27	These are commitments that turn Greek territory into a US-NATO base, but also into a target for retaliation if the imperialist conflict becomes more generalised.
EL_M_027	28	"They rank Greece as the ""champion"" in military spending for NATO needs, sending the bill to the people."
EL_M_027	29	In the context of these commitments, not only are the country's sovereign rights not shielded against the aggression of the Turkish state, but on the contrary, they are undermined.
EL_M_027	30	NATO and the EU are paving the ground that could lead to a Greek-Turkish conflict and a painful compromise on sovereign rights with a Euro-Atlantic stamp.

FR_003	1	Bordeaux: Snapp' sells its leading m-loyalty application Fidme to competitor Mediaperf
FR_003	2	Launched in 2010 and available on Android and Apple, Fidme enables its users to simplify their shopping by bringing together their daily shopping experience in a single application at any time, and also to be rewarded in their shopping journey, via their dematerialized loyalty cards and exclusive promotions.
FR_003	3	A unique offering of 35 million dematerialized loyalty cards.
FR_003	4	This acquisition enables the Médiaperf group to bring together Fidme, leader in this segment, and its main competitor Fidall , which belongs to the Médiaperf group.
FR_003	5	This enables us to offer a unique range of 35 million dematerialized loyalty cards used by 5 million consumers, of which 4 million come from Fidme.
FR_003	6	"""I'm delighted with this new acquisition, which strengthens our offering for retailers and brands wishing to address new mobile uses and optimize their customer relations."
FR_003	7	"The unique know-how developed by Fidme's teams to facilitate and enrich the shopping experience is a formidable gas pedal that Groupe Médiaperf will put at the service of shoppers, retailers and brands,"" explains Rémy Gerin, Chairman of Groupe Médiaperf."
FR_003	8	Founded in 1985 by its current Chairman Rémy Gerin, Groupe Médiaperf is a group of companies offering marketing services to supermarket brands and chains.
FR_003	9	Group sales amounted to €50 million in 2019.
FR_003	10	It is made up of Mediaperformances, the French leader in omnichannel on and off shopper activation, Fidme Hub, the new identity of the division, which brings together shopper-oriented mobile applications: Fidme, Fidall, Spoonymix, Flashcode, MobileTag, as well as ShopperFactory, the trading desk, and ShopAdvizor, the 1st community of customer reviews for FMCG products.
FR_003	11	The 20 employees in Bordeaux have been retained.
FR_003	12	"For his part, Fidme founder Jean-Benoît Charreton says he is ""convinced that Fidme's joining forces with the Médiaperf group will create significant value for both the group and all its employees."
FR_003	13	"It's the right time to sell and secure the business""."
FR_003	14	And this at a time when the hypermarket business model is being called into question.
FR_003	15	"He told ""Sud Ouest"" that the entire workforce of ""Sud Ouest"", i.e. 20 employees, would be retained."
FR_003	16	"""They will also remain in the current premises,"" he points out."
FR_003	17	The amount of the transaction has not been disclosed, but the Bordeaux-based Snapp' group, expert in mobile application development for customers such as Cetelem and Monoprix, intends to use this sum for external growth operations.
FR_003	18	It now employs 20 people and generates sales of 2 million euros.
FR_015	1	Automobiles: electric car sales soar but are threatened by a shortage of raw materials
FR_015	2	The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its annual report on electrification published on Monday May 23, is concerned that lithium, the material needed to manufacture electric cars, could run out.
FR_015	3	In particular, sales of electric vehicles have increased, and the raw materials for their manufacture are becoming increasingly scarce.
FR_015	4	Needs are critical, and rising prices and shortages could put the brakes on sales.
FR_015	5	Critical lithium requirements.
FR_015	6	According to the IEA, lithium requirements are critical and are expected to increase sixfold by 2030, to 500 kilotonnes, necessitating the opening of 50 new mines.
FR_015	7	These minerals are mined mainly in countries such as Australia, Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
FR_015	8	Electric car sales have doubled since 2020.
FR_015	9	Today, they account for 10% of new car sales.
FR_015	10	Sales continued to accelerate in early 2022, with two million units sold in the first quarter (+75% year-on-year).
FR_015	11	For their part, automakers have increased the number of available vehicles fivefold between 2015 and 2021: some 450 electric models are now on sale.
FR_015	12	Raw materials under very little control.
FR_015	13	Europe produces a quarter of all electric cars, but controls very few raw materials, just like the United States.
FR_015	14	"China produces three quarters of lithium-ion batteries, the dominant technology, and controls more than half of lithium, cobalt and graphite processing and refining capacity. ""European and American governments have made strong commitments to develop battery production capacity, but the majority of the supply chain is likely to remain Chinese until 2030"", stresses the IEA."
FR_015	15	Solutions to save these minerals would be to use alternative battery technologies, recycling, but also incentives to buy smaller cars.
FR_015	16	Other problems include rising raw material prices, as well as logistical problems linked to the war in Ukraine and the Covid-19-related confinements in China.
FR_015	17	These are all obstacles to the sale of electric vehicles.
FR_015	18	The International Energy Agency recommends increasing taxes on combustion vehicles, while gradually reducing subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles.
FR_015	19	The IEA also recommends extending these programs to trucks and buses, as well as to developing countries, and supporting them with the development of recharging networks.

FR_016	6	The Communauté d'agglomération bassin Sud (Cobas) has no shortage of projects, apart from the economy and work on the direct route (A 660, RN 250).
FR_016	7	350,000 worth of cycle paths are built or rebuilt in each city every year.
FR_016	8	It manages Bassin Formation and its 7 courses from CAP to BTS.
FR_016	9	She is leading work on the swimming pools, with the Arcachon pool still to be renovated.
FR_016	10	We also renewed 5.2 km of our drinking water network last year.
FR_016	11	For culture, it's the network of media libraries, with free access for Cobas residents.
FR_016	12	It is working on the creation of a single media library card and an intercommunal conservatory.
FR_016	13	Schools.
FR_016	14	Cobas also finances schools in the communes of the southern Basin and carries out the work.
FR_016	15	The Miquelots school complex in La Teste is one of the major projects to come.
FR_016	16	Pupils move out at the end of the February vacations, to allow the construction site to get underway for the planned 15 months of work.
FR_016	17	Work on the Pasteur school in Gujan is progressing apace, with 9 classrooms and a multi-purpose hall scheduled for completion in January 2023.
FR_016	18	At the Delta school in Le Teich, which was burnt down in 2019, the new school year will start after the February vacations.
FR_016	19	Work is also about to start on the Val des Pins school in Le Teich, which will be completely rebuilt and enlarged.
FR_016	20	Work in business park.
FR_016	21	The road network in the La Teste business park belongs to Cobas, which has been working on it for several months and will continue to do so.
FR_016	22	For the time being, they take place on Boulevard de l'Industrie.
FR_016	23	This part is due for completion in early February.
FR_016	24	Avenue Vulcain will also be renovated in the near future, and the plan is to make it Avenue de l'Europe while awaiting approval from the French government for the construction of a greenway.
FR_016	25	Firefighters. The new fire station in the business park will open at the end of February, once the fire department has moved out.
FR_016	26	The local authority finances half of the fire stations and the Service départemental d'incendie et de secours (Sdis) pays the other half.
FR_016	27	Waste.
FR_016	28	For waste, another major project, the transfer center is to be refurbished, as well as the La Teste waste collection center for individuals and businesses.
FR_016	29	Last year, the level of waste sorting and recovery increased.
FR_024	1	Belarus: Lukashenko parades with gun in hand
FR_024	2	"Surrounded by soldiers, an AKS-74U in hand, Alexander Lukashenko set the tone: in the face of the opposition's peaceful demands for freedom and democracy, the President of Belarus opted for a ""Putin-style"" show of force."
FR_024	3	The military is mobilized and deployed to defend against the phantom threat from outside, the better to orchestrate the stifling of the liberation movement at home.
FR_024	4	Illegitimate power.
FR_024	5	A milestone was reached on Wednesday August 19, when the European Union, at an extraordinary summit, decided not to recognize the validity of Lukashenko's fraudulent re-election as President of Belarus.
FR_024	6	In so doing, the EU has followed the recommendations of democratic opposition leader Svetlana Tsikhanovskaya, who is currently taking refuge in Lithuania to escape the brutal persecution of opponents.
FR_024	7	Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate Lukashenko, taking advantage of the crisis to seek a rapprochement with one of Europe's most isolated countries.
FR_024	8	Popular distrust of the Lukashenko dictatorship had already begun in May, with the Covid-19 health crisis. 3 of the 5 main online polling sites revealed the Belarusian president's great unpopularity, which peaked at around 3% positive opinion among those surveyed.
FR_024	9	Unable to improve his image with the Belarusian people, Lukashenko continued to make unpopular decisions right up to the presidential election, which was the occasion for a brutal and spectacular crackdown on any hint of reform and liberalization in the country.
FR_024	10	Brutal repression.
FR_024	11	The liberal and democratic movement, like the population exasperated by the incompetence of those in power, had to put up with police and military pressure from the tyrant in power.
FR_024	12	Among the countless victims of the regime is local Students for Liberty leader Piotr Markiulau , who spent 12 days in prison for supporting a family of political prisoners.
FR_024	13	Piotr Markiulau had already incurred the wrath of the authorities in December 2019 for denouncing fraud and corruption in parliamentary elections.
FR_024	14	Today, Belarus is one of the world's most archaic Communist dictatorships.
FR_024	15	However, the uprisings in Minsk raised hopes of democratic reform and liberalization.
FR_024	16	This hope must survive, and the desire for freedom must ignite the country.
FR_025	1	Law on separatism: Darmanin forgets that above the Republic, there is France...
FR_025	2	It's finally here.
FR_025	3	"On February 16, the mound gave birth to the expected baby, with the vote on the law on ""separatism"", passed by the National Assembly."
FR_025	4	"Clearly, this is a ""Nègre-Blanc"" motion, as we used to say in the heyday of the secular Third Republic, which was not particularly fond of the necessary ""republican"" assimilation of immigrants, even those of old European stock."
FR_025	5	In fact, French women at the time didn't even have the right to vote.
FR_025	6	"In other words, this Republic loved its sons more than its daughters, its neighbors more than its neighbors, to paraphrase another ""republican"": Jean-Marie Le Pen."
FR_025	7	"In fact, according to equally ""republican"" authorities, it was ""republican principles"" that had to be upheld."
FR_025	8	If we were to show an evil spirit (God forbid!)
FR_025	9	we would immediately add this codicil: which Republic are we talking about?
FR_025	10	By our reckoning, we're already in the Fifth.
FR_025	11	"Then there's the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which we can well imagine are not necessarily entirely in line with the ""republican"" elegance of our Republic on the move."
FR_025	12	"Not without reason, Marine Le Pen sees in this text a kind of declaration of war on religions, while the Melenchonist Alexis Corbière evokes another ""educational and territorial separatism""."
FR_025	13	"In this respect, it's worth noting that the two professions most likely to bypass the school map and shun neighborhoods with too much diversity are teachers and journalists - two eminently ""republican"" professions, as everyone knows."
FR_025	14	"Another ""separatism"" is Salafist Islam, which lives as a ""counter-society"" on the model of Saudi-style ghettos across the Atlantic."
FR_025	15	We can't say enough bad things about the Americanization of the Islamization of France.
FR_025	16	Then there's the big unspoken part: mass immigration, which has long been organized by big business.
FR_025	17	"To cover up this ""oversight"", the French government has resorted to a quasi-shamanic reminder of ""republican values"", with Gérald Darmanin, Minister of the Interior, not hesitating to point out that ""stigmatizing"" Muslims for whom the word of God remains essentially superior to that of men."
FR_025	18	Certainly, but for the average Catholic, even if he or she doesn't necessarily go to Mass regularly, what will he or she listen to in the final analysis: the voice of Christ in the Gospels, or that of Emmanuel Macron?
FR_025	19	Similarly, will we soon have to point the finger at our compatriots of the Jewish faith for holding in higher esteem what is written in the parchment of the Torah than in the constitutional marble of the Fifth Republic?
FR_025	20	The possibilities are endless.
FR_025	21	Are French Muslims shunning republican schools?
FR_025	22	If it's so that their children can learn gender theory and that transsexuals are the salt of the earth, we can also understand Islamic homeschooling and its Catholic equivalent.
FR_025	23	Gérald Darmanin should know that politics also involves transcendence, religious or otherwise.
FR_025	24	In short, it's also about realizing that somewhere, up there, there's a huge thing that's bigger than us.
FR_025	25	"Many ""republicans"", including Régis Debray and a few others, understood that before the advent of the ""Republic"", there was also life on Earth."
FR_038	1	Should the next world be greener, or should we correct our political system?
FR_038	2	Times of crisis are a good time to ask questions about the world to come.
FR_038	3	The newspaper 20 Minutes reports on a consultation launched by several NGOs and the citizen mobilization platform make.org , which aims to transform society based on popular consensus.
FR_038	4	This consultation has been a great success (80,000 participants, 19,000 proposals), which shows the need for new values.
FR_038	5	Enough to make Emmanuel Macron jealous, who invented the great national debate to ward off the yellow vest movement and who would well repeat the experience to get out of the mess he's gotten himself into.
FR_038	6	"On April 13, he invited us to ""build a French project"" and ""reinvent ourselves"", starting with ourselves."
FR_038	7	One might think that he wants to create a diversion and save himself, if not his government.
FR_038	8	This consultation is of a different kind.
FR_038	9	Its promoters clearly have ecological concerns, which we can't blame them for if they're sincere.
FR_038	10	But how much is spontaneity and how much is manipulation?
FR_038	11	The Director General of WWF France noted the link made by participants between the health crisis and other issues such as global warming, the loss of biodiversity and the impasse in our food supply.
FR_038	12	Real problems that can be analyzed objectively or exploited with militant fervor.
FR_038	13	Ecology is the most widely shared issue in the world: all political parties include it in their platforms, either out of conviction or electoral interest.
FR_038	14	Not surprisingly, an interim report on the consultation includes proposals on the need to rethink the impact of our consumption patterns, to improve natural spaces in cities, and to raise public awareness of global warming.
FR_038	15	Or recommendations for less intensive farming and more local production.
FR_038	16	All these recommendations can be well-founded, as long as they are measured and do not become an ideological obsession.
FR_038	17	The fact remains that ecological concerns are not directly linked to the epidemic crisis we're experiencing, and it's wrong to take advantage of the situation to promote them.
FR_038	18	More than ecology, it seems that this pandemic has above all revealed the weaknesses of our political system.
FR_038	19	Let's not talk about the executive's failings in management - it's not the first time it's shown itself to be deficient - but about its inability to inspire confidence, which, like virtue for Montesquieu, is a principle of democracy.
FR_038	20	The health crisis has confirmed that we are no longer truly in a democratic regime.
FR_038	21	At issue are the incompetence of our leaders and their psittacism, which takes the place of critical thinking, the weight of technocracy with its batch of out-of-touch decisions, the lack of real representativeness of the National Assembly, the hypocrisy of constantly claiming to be right while introducing exceptional rules that infringe on basic rights, and attempts to take control of the media and information.
FR_038	22	Our regime is falling into a kind of oligarchy where those in power think they can do whatever they like, and try to put protest to sleep.
FR_038	23	This transition to a form of autocracy, or even totalitarianism, is far more important than ecological concerns, however legitimate they may be.
FR_038	24	We need to reinvent ourselves, of course, but the world after will only be different from the world before if we oust the current leaders, who are primarily responsible for the bankruptcy of the state, and breathe new life into democracy.
FR_038	25	France's survival depends on it.
FR_041	1	Can the brain effectively combine natural and artificial vision?
FR_041	2	Macular degeneration (AMD) causes blindness in millions of people in the Western world.
FR_041	3	It is the most common cause of severe vision loss in people aged 50 and over, and its prevalence increases with age.
FR_041	4	Although there is no cure for AMD, recent major advances in artificial retinal implants may lead to a potential treatment.
FR_041	5	Until now, neurobiologists didn't know whether the brain could effectively combine natural and artificial vision; a new study has answered this question in the affirmative.
FR_041	6	Located inside the eye, the retina contains light receptors (photoreceptors) that absorb light.
FR_041	7	The information is then processed and transmitted to the brain.
FR_041	8	The macula, the central area of the retina, processes most of the information reaching the brain from the eyes, enabling vision during reading and driving, facial recognition and any other activity requiring precise vision.
FR_041	9	In the peripheral retina, the area outside the macula that primarily aids spatial judgment, vision is 10 to 20 times less precise.
FR_041	10	In AMD, precise vision is impaired by damage to the center of the retina, while peripheral vision remains normal.
FR_041	11	Brain: can effectively combine natural and artificial vision.
FR_041	12	When there is damage to the photoreceptor layers of the retina, an artificial retina - a device constructed from tiny electrodes smaller than the width of a human hair - can be implanted.
FR_041	13	Activation of these electrodes results in electrical stimulation of the remaining retinal cells, enabling visual restoration, albeit only partially.
FR_041	14	AMD patients implanted with an artificial retina have a combination of artificial central vision and normal peripheral vision.
FR_041	15	This combination of artificial and natural vision is important to study in order to understand how to help the blind.
FR_041	16	In this respect, one of the crucial questions is whether the brain can properly integrate artificial and natural vision.
FR_041	17	In a new study published in the journal Current Biology , researchers from Bar-Ilan University and Stanford University report for the first time the discovery of evidence indicating that the brain knows how to integrate natural and artificial vision, while retaining processing information that is important for vision.
FR_041	18	Towards a therapeutic solution for AMD and optimization of brain-machine interfaces.
FR_041	19	"We used a unique projection system that stimulated natural vision, artificial vision or a combination of natural and artificial vision, while simultaneously recording cortical responses in rodents implanted with a subretinal implant,"" says Tamar Arens-Arad."
FR_041	20	The implant is made up of dozens of tiny solar cells and electrodes, developed by Professor Daniel Palanker at Stanford University.
FR_041	21	These groundbreaking results have implications for better sight restoration in AMD patients implanted with retinal prostheses, and support our hypothesis that prosthetic and natural vision can be integrated in the brain.
FR_041	22	"The results could also have implications for future brain-machine interface applications, where artificial and natural processes coexist,"" concludes Yossi Mandel, Head of the Ophthalmic Science and Engineering Laboratory at Bar-Ilan University."
FR_043	1	Oumuamua: is the hypothesis of its artificial origin really plausible?
FR_043	2	For astronomers and astrophysicists, the law of gravity should always be the dominant factor when a large-scale object evolves in the Solar System.
FR_043	3	The Sun's gravitational attraction has by far the greatest effect, drawing all mass towards it in accordance with Newton's or Einstein's laws.
FR_043	4	According to Newton's law of gravitation, the only possible orbits should be a circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola.
FR_043	5	For an object like 'Oumuamua, the orbit must be hyperbolic.
FR_043	6	An object originating in our Solar System, from Neptune or beyond, could initially move at speeds of up to 1 km/s; 'Oumuamua began its entry into the Solar System at speeds in excess of 20 km/s.
FR_043	7	Without passing close to gas giants to benefit from a gravitational slingshot effect, the object is necessarily of interstellar origin.
FR_043	8	The only problem with this scenario is that the very detailed observations of Oumuamua showed no outgassing phenomena or tail-like structures.
FR_043	9	In addition to the unusual acceleration, the only remarkable property to emerge from the observations is the object's smooth, elongated shape.
FR_043	10	The unequal heating mechanism is extremely interesting.
FR_043	11	When one side of an interstellar object faces the Sun, it heats up to temperatures that can be several hundred degrees higher than those on the opposite side, resulting in a significant temperature gradient.
FR_043	12	Every object gives off energy in proportion to its temperature.
FR_043	13	The warm side then radiates more energy than the cold side.
FR_043	14	The irregular nature of the asteroid implies uneven radiation emission, which could, in principle, lead to abnormal acceleration.
FR_043	15	The acceleration calculations carried out in the context of this hypothesis have yet to be compared with the measurements made.
FR_043	16	The ultimate explanation is solar radiation pressure.
FR_043	17	This phenomenon is due to the transfer of the photon impulse onto a given surface; in other words, the flow of photons impinging on a surface causes the latter to move, applying a constant pressure.
FR_043	18	If 'Oumuamua has a large enough planar surface, coupled with relatively low mass, then solar radiative pressure could be responsible for its excess acceleration.
FR_043	19	This is the hypothesis developed by Baily and Loeb.
FR_043	20	By performing relatively simple calculations, the two astrophysicists showed that for an object with a particular mass/surface ratio, then the acceleration measured would correspond to that provided by solar radiation pressure.
FR_043	21	The authors could have stopped their development here and provided a perfectly plausible scientific explanation.
FR_043	22	Oumumua: an implausible artificial origin.
FR_043	23	Nevertheless, Baily and Loeb, while pointing out that such an object could be of natural origin, went on to introduce the hypothesis of an artificial origin as well, making direct reference to a spacecraft developed by an extraterrestrial civilization.
FR_043	24	It would thus use the solar sail principle, based on the radiative pressure phenomenon described above, to move around.
FR_043	25	Indeed, in their calculations, the authors show that in order to exhibit such a high acceleration as a function of the solar radiative pressure received, the structure would have to be between 0.3 and 0.9 mm thick.
FR_043	26	They point out that although extremely thin, such an object could survive interstellar travel on galactic scales, while resisting collisions with dust and gas, as well as rotational and tidal forces.
FR_043	27	They conclude their hypothesis by pointing out that if this structure is of natural origin, then it is necessarily composed of a material that is currently unknown in terms of the physical properties involved.
FR_043	28	If open-mindedness is an appreciated quality in science, we can reproach the two astrophysicists for this somewhat unfortunate extrapolation.
FR_043	29	There are several natural explanations for the observations and data collected that do not require the involvement of new physics, exotic scenarios or the intervention of extraterrestrial intelligence.
FR_043	30	Especially since the asteroid's spectral signature, color, reflectivity and a whole host of other properties are entirely consistent with a natural origin.
FR_043	31	Baily and Loeb have come up with an attractive hypothesis, but it's more science fiction than anything else, since it's only supported by the authors' own speculations.

FR_056	1	Belarus: army deployed after huge demonstration in the streets of Minsk
FR_056	2	For the second Sunday running, tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators took to the streets of Minsk on Sunday to protest against President Alexander Lukashenko, accused by his opponents of manipulating the ballot.
FR_056	3	At the same time, the army returned to the forefront of the Belarusian political crisis, indicating that it would be directly responsible for maintaining order and protecting monuments, rather than the police.
FR_056	4	Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled his country with an iron fist for 26 years, refuses to call new elections, which his main opponent, Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, a refugee in Lithuania, is calling for.
FR_056	5	On Sunday, the streets of Minsk were littered with red and white flags brandished by demonstrators as symbols of their opposition to the regime.
FR_056	6	They made their way to a monument whose entrance was protected by members of the security services in military uniform.
FR_056	7	The Ministry of Defense warned that it had been tasked with protecting such monuments, and that any attempt by demonstrators to occupy them would be met with military repression.
FR_056	8	Describing the demonstrators as fascists and writing most of its statement in capital letters, the Ministry of Defense declared that these monuments, particularly those honoring the victims of the Second World War, were sacred places that must not be desecrated.
FR_056	9	In a statement, the Belarusian Interior Ministry warned that any unauthorized demonstration would be deemed illegal, adding that 22 people had been arrested the previous day at rallies in 55 towns across the country.
FR_056	10	Russia, Minsk's powerful neighbor and traditional ally, on Sunday voiced strong criticism of Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya through its Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov.

FR_070	1	European countries establish common rules on minimum wages
FR_070	2	"This week, the European Parliament adopted new legislation on ""adequate"" minimum wages applicable in EU member states."
FR_070	3	"The legislation was passed by 505 votes in favor, 92 against and 44 abstentions, with the European Union stating that the new measures aim to ""improve the living standards and working conditions of all European workers""."
FR_070	4	And improved living standards mean better pay.
FR_070	5	"With this in mind, the EU has established ""minimum requirements"" for legal minimum wages in Europe."
FR_070	6	In the European Union, minimum wages are highest in Luxembourg, Ireland and Germany.
FR_070	7	They are lowest in Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia.
FR_070	8	While 21 out of 27 countries have a statutory minimum wage, the remaining six - Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Sweden - have chosen to determine wage levels through collective bargaining.
FR_070	9	This is a negotiation between employee representatives and the employer, at company or industry level.
FR_070	10	Little wonder, then, that this directive has been criticized by Denmark and Sweden.
FR_070	11	However, nothing will really change for the latter, since the directive will not oblige them to implement a legal minimum wage.
FR_070	12	"The Parliament specifies that setting a minimum wage will remain a national competence, but Member States will have to ensure that they ""enable workers to live decently"" and above all, ""taking into account the cost of living and different levels of remuneration""."
FR_070	13	This means, for example, that the minimum wage will have to keep pace with inflation.
FR_070	14	To assess the level of their legal minimum wage, each state will have to take 60% of the gross median wage and 50% of the gross average wage as a matching value.
FR_070	15	"The other important rule to remember is that collective bargaining at sectoral and inter-professional level is considered ""essential"" by the directive, in order to ""achieve an adequate level of protection offered by minimum wages""."
FR_070	16	"It must therefore be encouraged and strengthened."""
FR_070	17	In countries where less than 80% of workers are covered by collective bargaining, the Member States, in collaboration with the social partners, will have to draw up an action plan to increase this coverage. Application of the directive will be monitored, as each Member State will have to set up a control system, including reliable monitoring as well as on-the-spot checks and inspections.

FR_072	3	In the vast majority of high schools in Charente-Maritime, principals and teaching teams were working to define the terms and conditions for implementing the request made by National Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, who last Thursday called for more distance learning courses to be authorized.
FR_072	4	This reinforcement of the health protocol includes the holding of pedagogical meetings with teachers in order to fine-tune the most appropriate measures.
FR_072	5	It is closely monitored by the rectorat, where each dossier submitted by the high schools is examined by a pedagogical continuity unit.
FR_072	6	It verifies the quality of the desired organizations; it also supports high schools that express needs.
FR_072	7	31 plants to be reorganized.
FR_072	8	What is at stake is the right balance to be struck between distance learning and classroom teaching, a subject that has already been taken up by the trade unions.
FR_072	9	A framework has been established, with the imperative of providing high-quality follow-up for students, particularly in exam classes such as the first and final years.
FR_072	10	"Weekly meetings will be held between teachers, school life services and these students, with a coordinating teacher,"" adds the communications department of the Poitiers education authority, which does not yet have a precise overview of the work organization chosen by the schools."
FR_072	11	The editorial team advises you
FR_072	12	Of the department's 20 public and private general and technological high schools and 11 public and private vocational high schools, only a few had anticipated and were able to implement the new arrangements as early as Monday.
FR_072	13	The others should do so by the end of this week.
FR_072	14	This is the case at the Lycée polyvalent Audoin-Dubreuil in Saint-Jean-d'Angély, where the general and technological classes in seconde, première and terminale have been divided into alternating face-to-face and distance learning half-groups since Monday, and the timetable has been reorganized accordingly until the end of the month.
FR_072	15	In the vocational sections, face-to-face courses will be preferred.
FR_072	16	At the Lycée hôtelier in La Rochelle.
FR_072	17	The activated pedagogical continuity plan organizes an alternation of face-to-face and distance learning for students in the BTS and hotel and catering upgrading classes, with distance learning the rule for lectures, and face-to-face learning for practical work and tests.
FR_072	18	In Saintes.
FR_072	19	Starting on Thursday, the Lycée régional Palissy will be installing a two-day/three-day alternating schedule, with a complete rotation of the two sequences over four weeks.

FR_072	21	Christine Motillon, principal of the Lycée Professionnel Gilles-Jamain, points out that each class (there are 24 for 470 students) is now assigned to a room, or even two if you include the workshops.
FR_072	22	"In addition, since Monday, some courses have been given by videoconference: these are theoretical courses, for example in support, care and personal services,"" explains the principal, who has reintroduced signposting and introduced one-way traffic in the school to avoid crossing paths."

FR_078	1	Vaccination for children under 12, delta variant...
FR_078	2	Scientists worried about the start of the new school year There are just two weeks to go before the start of the new school year on September 2.
FR_078	3	At a time when the delta variant is on the increase, including in the youngest age groups, the question of vaccinating children under 12 has been reopened by certain scientists.
FR_078	4	"But for National Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, this is ""not topical""."
FR_078	5	The Minister was on a trip to the Hauts-de-Seine region on Thursday.
FR_078	6	On this occasion, he reminded us that only 12-17 year-olds are currently vaccinated.
FR_078	7	More than half of them received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine this summer.
FR_078	8	"""We are also exceeding the 30% of those who have had two (doses of) vaccines,"" Jean-Michel Blanquer pointed out."
FR_078	9	In his view, good vaccination coverage of adolescents should help keep schools open.
FR_078	10	"""It's obviously conducive to the most normal (school) year possible,"" he said."
FR_078	11	"He justified the government's decision not to vaccinate children ""in the light of scientific studies""."
FR_078	12	"""It's a subject that's being looked at on a global scale,"" he added."
FR_078	13	What's the current status of clinical trials?
FR_078	14	Pfizer and Moderna have long been conducting clinical trials in children under 12.
FR_078	15	Pfizer is due to report its first results in September, for children aged 5 to 11.
FR_078	16	Data for children aged 2 to 5 will be published in the autumn.
FR_078	17	As for Moderna, the results should arrive at the very end of 2021, or early 2022.
FR_078	18	AstraZeneca is behind schedule.
FR_078	19	The company had to suspend its trial in April pending information on cases of thrombosis potentially linked to its vaccine.
FR_078	20	The authorities are eagerly awaiting the results of these clinical trials, which will enable them to assess the benefit-risk ratio of vaccinating the very young.
FR_078	21	Detailed protocol to follow.
FR_078	22	In the next few days, the French government will announce the health protocol for schools.
FR_078	23	At the end of July, Jean-Michel Blanquer had already unveiled four possible scenarios, corresponding to the four degrees of circulation of the virus.
FR_078	24	It remains to be seen which one will be adopted.
FR_078	25	"""From now on, everyone can be sure that, one, we will open, two, the essential elements that we already know will be present,"" he said on Thursday, referring to the continued use of masks and respect for barrier gestures."
FR_078	26	"""There is obviously no health pass for going to school"", the Minister added."
FR_078	27	"""in September for students who have not been vaccinated""."
FR_078	28	"They will operate on the ""incentive"" principle."
FR_078	29	"""School must be as open as possible for all children in France,"" insisted Jean-Michel Blanquer."
FR_078	30	Not sure that his words will reassure scientists and teachers.
FR_078	31	"In an article published in Le Monde on Thursday, some thirty of them called for ""firm action"" to protect the health of schoolchildren in the face of the highly contagious delta variant."
FR_078	32	Among them are epidemiologists Dominique Costagliola and William Dab, infectiologist Gilles Pialoux and Dr Jérôme Marty, President of the UFML liberal physicians' union.
FR_078	33	"They point out that ""the hospitalization rate for 0-19 year olds increases in countries where the Delta variant is in the majority"", which is the case for France."
FR_078	34	"""Over the past year, 1.2% of 0-9 year olds who tested positive were hospitalized, and the number of hospitalizations is now double that of the same time last year"", they warn."
FR_078	35	Hospitalizations even quadrupled in the 10-19 age group.
FR_078	36	"In this age group, the incidence rate is ""five times higher than at the start of the 2020 school year""."

FR_080	2	The debate surrounding the lifting of patents on Covid-19 vaccines has taken a new turn.
FR_080	3	More than sixty countries have submitted a revised proposal on intellectual property rights to the World Trade Organization (WTO), reports Les Echos .
FR_080	4	In this text, published by the NGO Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) on its website, they call for the abandonment of protections to be extended to healthcare products and technologies, i.e. treatments, diagnostics, medical devices, protective equipment, materials and components needed for their production.
FR_080	5	This revision is intended to reflect concerns about ongoing mutations and the emergence of new variants, () as well as the global need for access and the importance of diversifying production and supply , according to the document relayed by KEI, whose authenticity the WTO has been unable to confirm at this time.
FR_080	6	According to the signatories, these issues and concerns have become even more acute and critical since the proposal was submitted in October 2020.
FR_080	7	Horizon.
FR_080	8	Also according to KEI, the new text also addresses the proposed duration of patent suspension, which must be practical for manufacturing to be feasible and viable.
FR_080	9	For the signatories, this derogation must be effective for at least three years.
FR_080	10	On Twitter, MSF echoed KEI's statement, posting a message to the European Union (EU): It's time to commit to global access to Covid-19 technologies.
FR_080	11	Dear EU, here's what you need to do: oblige EU pharmaceutical companies to share vaccine technology and know-how.
FR_080	12	On May 5, the organization issued a statement welcoming the Joe Biden administration's stance in favor of lifting intellectual property restrictions on vaccines designed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
FR_080	13	"Today's decision by the U.S. government is an important step towards global support for a World Trade Organization (WTO) waiver on intellectual property,"" said Avril Benoît, MSF's Executive Director in the United States."

FR_111	3	"However, we never found out what happened to this astronomical sum,"" the former head of the Central Bank of Iran told the Islamic Republic newspaper."
FR_111	4	In addition, after the signing of the nuclear deal (JCPOA) in 2015, over $150 billion of Iran's blocked capital was released.
FR_111	5	In 2017, despite all this wealth, people took to the streets in 140 cities to protest against the country's extreme economic stagnation, high inflation and poverty.

FR_111	13	Meanwhile, President Hassan Rohani has asked Khamenei to release two billion dollars from the Development Fund to compensate for the damage caused by the Coronavirus.
FR_111	14	Now Khamenei must approve this request, proving that the nation's capital is in Khamenei's hands, while he and the Revolutionary Guards (pasdaran) despoil this wealth.

FR_111	16	He needed a strong turnout to regain his legitimacy in the country and the world, after the last two uprisings in November 2019 and January 2020, during which many young people were killed by repressive forces.
FR_111	17	Prisoners in six of the country's prisons have rebelled for fear of being infected by the coronavirus, as they are exposed to it in a confined environment without the most basic sanitary facilities, and the regime does not release them.

FR_116	2	On Monday evening, the PCF announced the suspension of a member accused of rape by a member of the Mouvement des jeunes communistes de France (MJCF), and asked him to resign as a Blois town councillor.
FR_116	3	Another unrelated case is currently under investigation, according to the Communist Party.
FR_116	4	In an article published on February 24, two MJCF activists told L'Obs about the rape and sexual assault of which they claim to have been victims, and of which they accuse two activists.
FR_116	5	According to the PCF, at the end of last week, the two women contacted the PCF's internal Stop violences system.
FR_116	6	Rape complaint filed.
FR_116	7	After the hearing of one of the victims on Monday, the PCF decided to suspend the rights of her alleged assailant, who was also asked to resign his elective mandate, explained Hélène Bidard, national head of the PCF's feminism and women's rights commission.
FR_116	8	According to L'Obs , the young woman filed a rape complaint on October 24.
FR_116	9	The other victim is due to be heard by the party on Tuesday.
FR_116	10	According to L'Obs , the latter complained about the lack of reaction from the national coordinators of the MJCF, who had been informed.
FR_116	11	At the last MJCF congress on January 27, two national coordinators were accused by name by a group of activists of protecting aggressors for several years by systematically blaming the victims so that they would leave the organization, reports L'Obs Nine members dismissed since 2016.
FR_116	12	"Camille Lainé, general secretary of the MJCF, told L'Obs: ""I have never covered up for aggressors, and I have no evidence to suggest that other coordinators have done so."
FR_116	13	According to the weekly, since she took over as head of the organization in 2016, Ms. Lainé says she has been confronted with 11 cases -six for rape and five for assault.
FR_116	14	In all, nine members were dismissed and three cases gave rise to legal proceedings.
FR_116	15	In the wake of the #MeToo wave, the PCF has set up the Stop violences system, which can be contacted by e-mail, guaranteeing a response within eight days, while respecting anonymity, and being handled by referents trained in gathering victims' views.
FR_117	1	Austria: despite the Ibizagate scandal, the far right could return to power
FR_117	2	The desert crossing didn't last six months.
FR_117	3	In May, Austria's far-right was hit by a devastating scandal, and now, a week ahead of the general election, it is poised to return to power.
FR_117	4	Polls show the ÖVP, the conservative party of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz , well ahead with 34% of voting intentions.
FR_117	5	But behind them, with 20%, the FPÖ is hot on the heels of the Social Democrats, once again positioning itself as a possible coalition partner.
FR_117	6	In 2017, FPÖ and ÖVP formed an alliance to take over the country's leadership.
FR_117	7	In record time, the party founded by former neo-Nazis has recovered from the Ibizagate scandal that brought down the Kurz government.
FR_117	8	On May 17, in a video filmed on hidden camera in the Balearic Islands, the vice-chancellor and leader of the movement, Heinz-Christian Strache, revealed his willingness to offer major public contracts to a Russian oligarch in exchange for secret financing.
FR_117	9	The victimization card.
FR_117	10	"Despite this, the FPÖ's electoral base has not fled: ""The party is deeply rooted in the Austrian political landscape,"" explains historian Jérôme Segal."
FR_117	11	"His supporters see him as the only anti-system formation, the only one that represents an alternative to the left-right grand coalition that has ruled the country for decades."""
FR_117	12	Strache also played the victim card, claiming to be the object of a cabal hatched by his opponents.
FR_117	13	A winning strategy.
FR_117	14	In the European elections on May 26, the FPÖ achieved a respectable score of 17.2%.
FR_117	15	To complete the rehabilitation work, Strache had to be sacrificed.
FR_117	16	Make way for Norbert Hofer, who took the helm last weekend.
FR_117	17	The former aeronautical engineer has for him his past score of 46.2% in the 2016 presidential election.
FR_117	18	To the right of the extreme right.
FR_117	19	"""Hofer is the ideal son-in-law, with a polished image and a spotless past"", Jérôme Segal points out, even if in essence he ""also remains to the right of the far right""."
FR_117	20	The party's other strongman, former Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, is also known for his radical and provocative rhetoric.
FR_117	21	In fact, the FPÖ's campaign revolves around the same theme: immigration.
FR_117	22	Will Sebastian Kurz give in to the FPÖ's advances again?
FR_117	23	It would appear so, even though 60% of Austrians consider the far-right movement unfit to govern.
FR_117	24	The President of the Republic, Alexander Van der Bellen, announced that he would oppose Kickl's return to government.
FR_117	25	What's in it for Kurz?
FR_117	26	"Anticipating a rebuff from the latter, Norbert Hofer recently threatened: ""If the conservatives want to form a government with the left and the ecologists, I wish them a safe journey."
FR_117	27	"Because if we do, we'll be back up to 30% in the polls."""
FR_125	1	Belgian banks help entrepreneurs
FR_125	2	Faced with the general rise in the cost of living, banks are offering more and more tools and services to help us optimize our spending (price comparators, budget analysis tools, etc.).
FR_125	3	But these new tools aren't just for households.
FR_125	4	They are also aimed at companies whose management is currently complicated by the inflationary crisis, but also by repeated wage indexations, the threat of recession, the shortage of talent, and so on.
FR_125	5	In this context, Belfius has just signed a partnership agreement with Walloon scale-up EMAsphere.
FR_125	6	Like the one already in place between the platform and BNP Paribas Fortis, this new collaboration will enable the bank's corporate customers to benefit from reliable, automatically-updated financial reporting, created specifically for them to better monitor their cash flow.
FR_125	7	"Accessible in ""SaaS"" (Software as a Service) mode, the solution connects to the company's accounting software."
FR_125	8	Customers can access and visualize their own figures in the form of dashboards and other graphs, such as cash flow performance and trends, customer and supplier payment times, earnings trends, etc.
FR_125	9	Offered at an attractive price for Belfius customers, the solution also includes a health report (a projection based on an indicator called Runway, created specifically for Belfius customers, which enables the company to see how much cash it has left for the coming months).
FR_125	10	"Eventually, ""the solution should also facilitate communication between the company and the bank, particularly for loan applications"", says Reginald Nobels, Associate Director at EMAsphere, adding that the tool is already being used by 10,000 companies, not least because of the growing need for SMEs ""to be increasingly agile and able to react ever more quickly""."
FR_125	11	On a different note, business customers of Crelan and Axa Banque (acquired by Crelan earlier this year) who have difficulty paying their energy bills, despite a good credit rating, can now call on a brand new line of credit called Energie.
FR_125	12	This temporary solution is designed to help entrepreneurs (SMEs and the self-employed) relieve their cash flow by offering them a credit facility of between 12,500 and 50,000 euros for six months, at a lower cost than the normal rate.
FR_125	13	"""The actual size of the credit line is calculated individually for each customer based on the increase in costs due to energy bills over the next six months,"" the bank states."
FR_125	14	As for the rate applied, the six-month Euribor (interest rate on the interbank market for short-term loans between banks) is used as the reference, which is then increased by 1%.
FR_125	15	As an indication, the interest rate on the credit line is currently around 2.8%.
FR_126	1	"Charente-Maritime: Choosing ""vanlife"" for your vacations"
FR_126	2	More than a vacation choice, van life represents a certain philosophy for many converts.
FR_126	3	"""We've always lived simply."
FR_126	4	"We're careful about what we consume, we live on a shoestring,"" explains Aurélie, who works in vineyard planning."
FR_126	5	"A life that already suited Jonathan in Canada: ""Back then, we had a small caravan that we pulled by car, and we traveled the roads of Quebec."
FR_126	6	We also did a lot of traveling on foot.
FR_126	7	"Now, with children, the van is better adapted."" Amandine fitted out her van herself, installing a gas stove and water supply."
FR_126	8	We see all generations, from young families to 70-year-olds leaving with their sons.
FR_126	9	"This morning, the father-of-one even had a job interview by videoconference from his vehicle. ""I bought a white polo shirt a few hours beforehand, and hung up a poster behind me to hide the interior of the van,"" confesses Jonathan, who could see himself teleworking from the road on his travels."
FR_126	10	"On social networks, the ""vanlife"" (life in a van), gathers a growing community, sharing experiences and good tips."
FR_126	11	"This solidarity is also evident on the road. ""As soon as we come across other users, we swap and help each other out if need be."
FR_126	12	"This morning, we made friends with a Spaniard from Madrid."" Rentals on the rise."
FR_126	13	In the département, many vans set up shop in parking lots facing the ocean.
FR_126	14	"Accommodation with a sea view, at the lowest possible cost. ""It's a solution that allows you to save money on your vacations. But you still need to be able to afford a van."
FR_126	15	Jonathan and Aurélie bought theirs second-hand for 15,000 euros three years ago.
FR_126	16	"A Volkswagen California T4 model, dating from 1992, for a vintage feel. ""We're lucky in that we've had very few mechanical problems."
FR_126	17	"But you have to be careful, because a visit to the garage can quickly become expensive with these vehicles."" To spend the night, the traveler settled near Parc des Pères."
FR_126	18	For those who don't feel ready to take the plunge, rental remains a solution.
FR_126	19	At between 1,000 and 1,200 euros a week in high season, many travelers are taking the plunge.
FR_126	20	"Jean-Luc Brouard, manager of the We Van agency in La Rochelle, is delighted to observe the growing trend. ""We've been in the area for just over a year, and we're inundated with requests every summer."
FR_126	21	"There was a Covid effect, where a lot of people took the plunge, but since then, the appeal hasn't waned."" Mercedes, Volkswagen, Ford - there's no shortage of manufacturers offering their range of vans."
FR_126	22	For two or four people, with or without shower and toilet, there's no shortage of models to choose from.
FR_126	23	Enough to satisfy every customer.
FR_126	24	"""We're really looking at all generations, from young families to 70-year-olds setting off with their sons on the roads of their past."""
FR_126	25	A breeze of freedom.
FR_126	26	Amandine Del opted for another solution.
FR_126	27	Two years ago, she invested in a van, which she then fitted out herself.
FR_126	28	In just a few weeks, the young woman from Pas-de-Calais set up a mattress, a small gas stove and water supplies.
FR_126	29	A real Tetris, allowing you to be self-sufficient for a few days' expedition.
FR_126	30	For three weeks in August, Amandine will be touring France.
FR_126	31	"She stopped for a night at Parc des Pères, in La Rochelle. ""I see friends all over the country."
FR_126	32	"It also allows me to replenish my supplies. On the 2,800 kilometers already covered, the traveler takes her time. ""I'm in no hurry."
FR_126	33	"I avoid the main roads so I don't have to pay tolls, which saves me money."" With her solar shower, Amandine has hot water for washing."
FR_126	34	"But ""vanlife"" also calls for astuteness."
FR_126	35	If Aurélie and Jonathan are worried about finding a place to shower, Amandine has thought of everything.
FR_126	36	Every day, she fills her solar shower.
FR_126	37	Placed in the sun, the twenty-liter bag provides hot water for washing.

FR_131	3	This week, Aserc, Cognac's socio-educational and cultural center, responsible for crime prevention, the fight against exclusion and social outreach, is organizing its first Festy'Urbain, a week of workshops dedicated to urban art.
FR_131	4	Starting on Monday, these workshops will culminate in an open stage performance (1).
FR_131	5	"Some thirty young people, aged between 11 and 25, have signed up. ""I like boxing as much as hip-hop,"" says Ilovan, 11, who has signed up with his older brother Amenzo, 13."
FR_131	6	"He performs a few figures, grinning from ear to ear. ""Hip-hop demands rigor and endurance."
FR_131	7	There are codes to respect, and a great deal of discipline is required.
FR_131	8	"And at the same time, there's a freestyle side to it that's ideal for letting off steam,"" says Rayzo, a professional dancer, choreographer and breakdance teacher who supervises the hip-hop workshop."
FR_131	9	Founder of the In6dance crew, his aim is to share his passion.
FR_131	10	And it shows in the room at the MTL (Maison du temps libre) de la Chaudronne.
FR_131	11	"It's a mix of mental and physical activity ""to clear the head"", he explains."
FR_131	12	Youngsters are also invited to take part in graffiti workshops with Atom Ludik.
FR_131	13	Why a Festy'Urbain?
FR_131	14	"""The aim is to mobilize and develop local young people, get them involved and raise their awareness of urban expression techniques, while ensuring gender (hip-hop groups) and social diversity,"" explains Catherine Bretodeau, in charge of cultural development at Aserc."
FR_131	15	.
FR_131	16	"""The Friday evening is open to all and free of charge."
FR_131	17	"It's also a way of changing the sometimes negative image of young people in the neighborhoods,"" points out Amélie Denis, youth coordinator for the Champ de Foire district."

FR_137	3	"The head of state didn't ""listen"" to them."
FR_137	4	"Emmanuel Macron ""hasn't listened to what we've been saying"", reacted yellow vest figures on Thursday, skeptical of the decisions announced after the Grand Débat wanted by the president to respond to this unprecedented social protest."
FR_137	5	"""He hasn't listened to what we've been saying on the streets for the past five months,"" said Maxime Nicolle ."
FR_137	6	"""He began his speech by saying that what he'd been doing for the past two years had been very good, and that we hadn't understood him."
FR_137	7	"We've understood perfectly well, he's incapable of a mea culpa."""
FR_137	8	"An income tax cut that requires ""more work"" and cuts in public spending, pensions of less than 2,000 euros reindexed to inflation, no blank vote or citizens' initiative referendum (RIC), lowering the number of signatures required to submit a bill to Parliament In a two-and-a-half-hour speech, the head of state made a series of announcements while defending his reforms."
FR_137	9	"""Everything is postponed, everything is vague"" ""He's just thrown out a few breadcrumbs like the reindexation of pensions,"" Maxime Nicolle opined, lamenting the dismissal of the RIC , one of the main demands of the yellow vests."
FR_137	10	"""Simply lowering the threshold for a popular initiative referendum is completely pointless, you still need parliamentary approval,"" he said indignantly."
FR_137	11	"Emmanuel Macron ""wants to lower taxation by cutting public spending and at the same time he wants more people in schools and hospitals, it's completely contradictory,"" he added."
FR_137	12	"""Everything is postponed, everything is vague, nothing is precise, so on Saturday we'll show him that we too know how to do things in depth and on May 1st too,"" he launched, calling for further demonstrations."

FR_138	2	"The government, which wants to convince the French that it has heard their demands after the ""yellow vests"" crisis, unveiled a draft 2020 budget on Thursday to support purchasing power, against a backdrop of an expected slowdown in growth."
FR_138	3	"The ""gilets jaunes"" crisis and concerns about the global economy ""lead us to make decisions that favor investment and consumption"", defended Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at a press conference."
FR_138	4	"The government is thus planning over 9 billion euros in tax cuts for the French, notably via the 5 billion euro income tax cut promised by President Emmanuel Macron at the end of the ""great national debate""."
FR_138	5	At the same time, the abolition of the taxe d'habitation will continue, affecting 80% of households next year, representing a gain of over 3 billion euros for the taxpayers concerned.
FR_138	6	Declining growth.
FR_138	7	These measures designed to support purchasing power are also intended to fuel economic growth threatened by the slowdown in the global economy and uncertainties linked to trade tensions between the United States and China and Brexit.
FR_138	8	The government has revised its growth forecast for 2020 downwards to 1.3%, compared with the 1.4% initially forecast.
FR_138	9	France will thus do less well than this year, where gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise by 1.4%, although it should hold up better than its neighbors.
FR_138	10	In terms of savings, however, the Finance Bill confirms a virtual freeze on most social benefits (family allowances, housing subsidies, etc.).
FR_138	11	On the other hand, after having already agreed to reindex retirement pensions of less than 2,000 euros to inflation, the government had to abandon in extremis the reduction of a benefit for senior citizens who employ home help, in the face of protests even from its own majority.
FR_138	12	Companies put to the test.
FR_138	13	Businesses, for their part, will see certain tax niches phased out (off-road diesel, specific flat-rate deduction).
FR_138	14	Corporate income tax, the flagship measure of Emmanuel Macron's business support policy at the start of his five-year term, will indeed fall, but less quickly than expected.
FR_138	15	In total, companies will contribute 1.3 billion euros to the savings, but will see their overall tax bill shrink by one billion euros, Bercy assures us.
FR_138	16	In the end, the State civil service will be less affected, with only 47 job cuts for all State employees and operators with a public service mission.
FR_138	17	However, trends vary greatly from one ministry to another, with the Interior and Justice being the big winners and Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion the big losers.
FR_138	18	Over the five-year period, 10,500 jobs will be eliminated, a far cry from the 50,000 planned in the presidential program, announced Public Accounts Minister Gérald Darmanin.
FR_138	19	As a result, the deficit will indeed fall next year, after peaking this year at 3.1%, but it will be 2.2% of GDP, compared with the 2% initially forecast by the government.
FR_138	20	Above all, the structural deficit (excluding exceptional items and economic trends) will remain stable, and public debt will barely fall to 98.7% of GDP, after jumping to 98.8% this year.

FR_142	10	- A major change: work will be a reason for exemption. - As was the case during the first confinement, travel from one region to another will be prohibited.
FR_142	11	However, there will be a grace period for returning home this weekend, as the school vacations come to an end. - Compulsory rapid tests for Covid-19 will be deployed for all new arrivals.
FR_142	12	Europe's internal borders will remain open and its external borders closed.
FR_142	13	Schools remain open. - Crèches, schools, collèges and lycées will remain open with reinforced sanitary protocols.
FR_142	14	Extra-curricular activities will also be maintained. - The wearing of masks will be extended to primary school children, from the age of six upwards, instead of the current eleven. - In universities, on the other hand, it's time for distance learning: only practical work will be maintained, under specific conditions.
FR_142	15	Gatherings prohibited, visits authorized in Ehpad. - Private gatherings outside the strict family circle will be excluded, and public gatherings prohibited. - For the elderly, visits to Ehpads and retirement homes will be authorized in strict compliance with health regulations, in order to avoid the human tragedies of the spring, Emmanuel Macron assured. - People with disabilities will benefit from flexibility in the application of the protocol. - Cemeteries will remain open during All Saints' Day, and it will be possible to continue to bury our loved ones with dignity.
FR_142	16	Telecommuting five days a week. - Business activity will continue with greater intensity than during the first lockdown because, according to Emmanuel Macron, the economy must not come to a standstill or collapse. - Telecommuting should be as widespread as possible, and is recommended for five days out of five in companies and administrations.
FR_142	17	Employees and employers who are unable to work will continue to benefit from short-time working. - Unlike in spring, public services, factories, farms, buildings and public works will remain open... - Bars and restaurants will be closed, as will all shops with the exception of basic necessities.
FR_142	18	Food markets will remain open, however, unless prefects decide otherwise.
FR_142	19	Companies helped. - The support measures put in place during the first lockdown will be extended and amplified. - All sectors subject to administrative closure will benefit from assistance of up to 10,000 euros per month via the Solidarity Fund, as well as partial activity at zero cost to the employer. - SMEs experiencing difficulties will be able to benefit from increased tax exemptions, and the state-guaranteed loan scheme will be extended by six months.
FR_142	20	Culture at a standstill. - No theater or cinema: event, film and live performance companies will be closed.
FR_142	21	Preparatory work for shows (rehearsals, recordings, etc.) will still be permitted. - Bookshops will be closed. - Sports businesses will also be closed, although top-level and professional athletes will be able to continue training and competing. - In contrast to the first lockdown, parks and gardens may remain open.
FR_142	22	"Confinement until December 1. - The system will be re-evaluated every 15 days to adapt or lighten certain constraints, particularly on businesses. - I cultivate the hope of celebrating this precious moment of Christmas and the end-of-year festivities with my family,"" said Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday."

FR_149	19	Platforms will have to let users know the parameters used to target them and the financer of the ad.
FR_149	20	The European Parliament wants to add a ban on exploiting sensitive user data (gender, political leaning, religious affiliation...) for targeted advertising, to prevent opinion manipulation.
FR_149	21	As far as minors are concerned, this ban will apply to all their personal data.
FR_149	22	The European Parliament's ambition is to ban rigged interfaces that push users towards certain paid services or account settings.
FR_149	23	Revenge porn will also be included in the text, with systematic removal of this type of content.
FR_149	24	Finally, online retailers will have to check the identity of their suppliers before authorizing them on their platform, and block recidivist fraudsters.
FR_149	25	The option of conducting random tests on certain products is also being considered by MEPs.
FR_149	26	A new complaints and sanctions system.
FR_149	27	Users will be able to lodge a complaint against a digital service provider with the competent authority, citing a breach of the regulation.
FR_149	28	Online sales sites that fail to meet their obligations may be held liable for any damage suffered by buyers of non-compliant or dangerous products.
FR_149	29	On the subject of fines, these could rise to 6% of annual sales and be accompanied by a penalty payment of up to 5% of daily sales.
FR_157	1	How much is the war in Ukraine costing France?
FR_157	2	The war in Ukraine: how much is it costing?
FR_157	3	S'entend, pour la France.
FR_157	4	It's hard to say, given the avalanche of figures quoted here and there.
FR_157	5	Echoing a study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, or , on February 10, put the figure at 7.4 billion euros.
FR_157	6	By way of comparison, the budget of the Ministry of Justice will be 9.57 billion in 2023, and that of the Armed Forces 43.9 billion.
FR_157	7	You can put whatever you like on the figures, but it means that aid to Ukraine represents 17% of France's own defense spending.
FR_157	8	That's no mean feat.
FR_157	9	In addition, we need to take into account the European Union's aid to the EU in 2022: 35 billion (again, figures from the Kiel Institute).
FR_157	10	However, in 2022, France paid 26.35 billion euros to the European Union (including 24.586 billion under the Finance Act passed in December using the 49.3 calibre, the latest barrel to come out of the Borne factories).
FR_157	11	It's true that, in return, France has received and is receiving several billion euros from Europe, but it pays more to the EU than it receives: in those billions paid by the EU to Ukraine, there are bound to be French euros!
FR_157	12	So 7.4 billion today.
FR_157	13	A leap.
FR_157	14	The same Kiel Institute spoke of 1.4 billion for the period from January 24 to November 20, 2022.
FR_157	15	On December 13, 2022, CNews, citing figures from the Élysée Palace in Paris, reported that the figure of 2.7 billion euros had been exceeded, i.e. 700 million more than the 2 billion initially promised by Emmanuel Macron.
FR_157	16	War in Ukraine, a war of numbers!
FR_157	17	These are direct costs.
FR_157	18	It's worth noting that in a country where, in 2001, the legislator instituted an organic law on finance laws (LOLF), with the virtuous objective of establishing genuine management control over state public spending, in a logic of performance and transparency, we (i.e. Parliament, i.e. citizens) would be entitled to have an exact assessment of what this war has cost, is costing and will cost France's budget.
FR_157	19	Bruno Le Maire and Bruno Attal could do that to us.
FR_157	20	Simply in financial terms.
FR_157	21	And we're not talking about the rest... because we could mention the indirect costs.
FR_157	22	"Published last December, we quote: ""The French economy is undergoing a major external levy shock of at least 1.5% of GDP, mainly due to the sharp rise in energy prices in Europe as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine."
FR_157	23	"The result is excessively high inflation and a drain on the real incomes of companies and households, largely cushioned, however, by public finances."" And who or what are public finances?"
FR_157	24	It's the taxpayer, it's the debt (and therefore future generations).
FR_157	25	"In the same report, the Banque de France refers to ""a shock to external levies due to pressure on the prices of energy and other imported raw materials, before a gradual normalization"", again ""following the war in Ukraine""."
FR_157	26	"This ""reduces household purchasing power and corporate margins, while undermining the competitiveness of exporting companies where prices have risen the most""."
FR_157	27	No figures are given in this analysis, but we can imagine that the meter must be running in billions of lost revenue, in lost tax receipts for the State, with a weakened economy.
FR_157	28	"Of course, it's not just the war in Ukraine: we're not going to pull the stunt they tried to do to us over the energy crisis, but all the same... Three years ago, Emmanuel Macron was waging an atrocious war on Covid, ""whatever it takes""."
FR_157	29	"Today, he affirms his determination ""to accompany the team to victory""."
FR_157	30	Whatever the cost?
FR_157	31	"And we've only talked about money here, not blood... Emmanuel Macron asserts his determination ""to accompany the French towards victory""."
FR_158	1	PSG: Mergitur nec fluctuat
FR_158	2	So PSG drank the chalice to the dregs on Saturday evening.
FR_158	3	Macron must have been jubilant inside, as an OM fan, when he handed the cup to the captain of the valiant Rennes team, who had pulled off a fine Rennesmontada.
FR_158	4	One more at PSG's expense!
FR_158	5	After the disappointments in the European Cup and the two domestic cups, let's add for good measure, among the season's many failures, the number of league wins, the record number of goals scored (the record is currently held by the now defunct Racing Club de Paris: 118 points), the number of points obtained (PSG was aiming for 100 points).
FR_158	6	What's left is to win the championship, which is the least we can do given the resources deployed.
FR_158	7	François Pinault's Rennes, like Jean-Michel Aulas's Lyon and a few others, are French teams: the investor is French, the chairman is French, the staff is French, as are most of the players.
FR_158	8	PSG is the team from Qatar, an emirate which has been criticized for its proximity to Islamic terrorism, and which has little respect for human rights (or French labor law).
FR_158	9	We love Qatar in France... We have to sell Rafales and weapons.
FR_158	10	The Emir decides everything from Doha.
FR_158	11	When President Nasser is here, he's just a figurehead.
FR_158	12	Elegant and polished, this former tennis player never makes waves, but he knows nothing about soccer and has been making mistakes ever since the arrival of QSI (Qatar Investment Authority).
FR_158	13	Far from correcting them, it accentuates them season after season.
FR_158	14	Its recruiting mistakes are disastrous, and its motley, cosmopolitan management team is notoriously incompetent and makes a mess of things.
FR_158	15	There's no Frenchman in it, either on the staff or in the team, apart from a few Parisian titis that UEFA rules impose.
FR_158	16	One world star follows another, recruited and paid at a premium, while others don't justify the sums spent to bring them in.
FR_158	17	These stars do as they please and we forgive them anything (Zlatan, Neymar, etc.).
FR_158	18	However, the laxity stops at the French players, some of whom have to endure humiliation, harassment and relegation for reasons that are more often than not extra-sporting (Ben Arfa, Rabiot).
FR_158	19	Ben Arfa took his revenge in fine style on Saturday with his Rennes colleagues.
FR_158	20	Rabiot is still a tenant in the closet.
FR_158	21	From the first to the fifteenth day of the season, PSG took 43 points from 15 matches (14 wins-1 draw), i.e. 2.87 points per match in mid-December, while the following 19 matches saw a total of 35 points, i.e. 1.84 per match.
FR_158	22	Amazing, isn't it?
FR_158	23	It should be noted that Adrien Rabiot played as a starter in his first 15 games before being relegated.
FR_158	24	Of course, the above is purely coincidental, as is the tumble that followed until Saturday evening.
FR_158	25	The solution to PSG's problems is simple: renationalization!
FR_158	26	Let it become French again, with a Platini or a Wenger at its head.
FR_158	27	Or why not... a Sarko!
FR_174	1	A woman soon to head British bank RBS
FR_174	2	If confirmed, Alison Rose would be the first woman to head a major British bank.
FR_174	3	According to Sky News, Alison Rose is to take over the helm at Royal Bank of Scotland from New Zealand banker Ross McEwan, who is to head up National Australia Bank.
FR_174	4	If confirmed, Alison Rose would be the first woman to head a major British bank.
FR_174	5	Has Mark Carney been heard?
FR_174	6	Last June, the Governor of the Bank of England expressed concern about the low representation of women in finance, especially in senior positions.
FR_174	7	"""It's particularly striking to see that more women than men start out in financial services, only to see their representation decline as they move up the hierarchy"". he said, speaking at a ceremony in London dedicated to women in banking and finance."
FR_174	8	Echoing this speech, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) could give a strong signal encouraging gender diversity in this industry, where women account for just 14% of the composition of executive committees, according to figures gathered by Jayne-Anne Gadhia, long-time head of Virgin Money, and quoted by Mark Carney.
FR_174	9	Pure product of Royal Bank of Scotland. revealed on Saturday August 10 that RBS, one of Britain's four largest banks alongside HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, was preparing to appoint Alison Rose as its new Chief Executive.
FR_174	10	If confirmed, this would be the first time a woman has headed a major British bank.
FR_174	11	Alison Rose, a Royal Bank of Scotland product with over 25 years' experience, is currently in charge of the bank's retail and private banking activities.
FR_174	12	Last December, she was also appointed Chief Operating Officer of NatWest Holdings, the subsidiary that groups together services for individuals and SMEs in the UK.
FR_174	13	According to the Financial Times , Alison Rose came out on top against Ian Stuart, current boss of HSBC, to win the support of the RBS board, according to two sources close to the matter, who say that an announcement is expected later this month.
FR_174	14	Big favorite.
FR_174	15	The British daily points out that the bank's directors met both candidates last month and were impressed by Alison Rose's in-depth knowledge of the bank and her restructuring plans for the group, still 62% state-controlled after its rescue during the financial crisis.
FR_174	16	On August 2, the group warned that it was unlikely to meet its profitability and expenditure targets next year, due to a difficult economic environment as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.
FR_174	17	A strong favorite, Alison Rose is expected to succeed Ross McEwan, the bank's current New Zealand boss, by the end of this year at the latest. McEwan announced his departure in April, after five and a half years in the post, to take over at National Australia Bank.
FR_174	18	"Two women in key positions at the bank ""The process of appointing Ross McEwan's successor is underway."
FR_174	19	"Our next CEO will be confirmed in due course, once an appointment has been made"", the British bank simply commented on Saturday August 10."
FR_174	20	Alison Rose's appointment will bring women into RBS's two most senior management positions, following Katie Murray's appointment as CFO at the end of last year.
FR_174	21	Alison Rose is also the author of Rose Review , a government-commissioned investigation into the obstacles facing women entrepreneurs.
FR_174	22	Another major British bank is currently looking for a new boss.
FR_174	23	It's HSBC.
FR_181	1	Automotive.
FR_181	2	Did you know there's a high-tech material in your car... cork?
FR_181	3	Did you know that there's a high-tech material in your car... cork.
FR_181	4	The MX-30, the first 100% electric Mazda launched last year, is unique in that it uses cork as its interior lining.
FR_181	5	A natural material that evokes respect for the environment, in keeping with the vehicle's electric vocation.
FR_181	6	Just an announcement?
FR_181	7	Not so sure.
FR_181	8	In fact, cork is increasingly used in industry.
FR_181	9	What are the benefits?
FR_181	10	Why are we likely to see more and more of them in our cars?
FR_181	11	We went to Portugal, to the factory that wants to put cork in your cars.
FR_181	12	When cork was discovered in the interior of the latest Mazda MX-30, few observers would have made the connection with the history of the Japanese brand.
FR_181	13	Mazda hasn't always made cars.
FR_181	14	In 1920, Toyo Cork Kogyo, the forerunner of Mazda, was founded, supplying natural cork to industrial companies in the Hiroshima region.
FR_181	15	Today, this material is making a comeback in the brand's cars.
FR_181	16	But what are its qualities?
FR_181	17	Visiting the Amorim factory, which supplies Mazda with cork, the first thing that strikes you is the sheer quantity of cork stocked.
FR_181	18	Admittedly, there's no shortage of opportunities.
FR_181	19	From the soles of your shoes, to entire building constructions, to the insulation in your car's engine, cork is everywhere.
FR_181	20	Perhaps the most surprising use is by NASA and ESA (European Space Agency).
FR_181	21	Cork is essential for the manufacture of heat shields used on space shuttles.
FR_181	22	Cork's ecological credentials lie first and foremost in the way it is used.
FR_181	23	It's a natural material derived from cork oaks.
FR_181	24	The big advantage is that, unlike wood, you don't have to cut down the tree to harvest the precious material.
FR_181	25	Producers simply remove the bark, leaving the plant intact so that it can continue to produce cork.
FR_181	26	Renewable and recyclable, it's also versatile.
FR_181	27	This could well make it indispensable in our cars in the years to come.
FR_181	28	Tomorrow, this cork waste will be transformed into shoes, houses or space rockets.
FR_181	29	It does it all Cork is first and foremost a formidable insulator.
FR_181	30	A valuable asset for our electric cars.
FR_181	31	While engine noise is virtually non-existent, this silence leads to the appearance of parasitic noises previously covered by the mechanics.
FR_181	32	Electric cars are heavy, and every gram counts.
FR_181	33	"""By insulating the passenger compartment with cork, it would be possible to limit noise without putting on too much weight"", assures us an industry professional."
FR_181	34	Cork's other quality is its ability to insulate against heat.
FR_181	35	"""We're using it more and more to insulate engine heat, for example."""
FR_181	36	"For Mazda's Yoichi Matsuda, ""The interior of a car can be a particularly difficult environment""."
FR_181	37	Light, flexible, buoyant, abrasion-resistant and virtually impervious to liquids and gases, cork is the ideal material, but it also requires real expertise.
FR_181	38	"""The cork in the MX-30 undergoes an elaborate process to achieve the desired appearance and characteristics,"" says the manufacturer."
FR_181	39	The company's developers used different sizes of cork granules to minimize gaps in the material.
FR_181	40	"""It was out of the question for this coating to be less robust over time than the other materials used in Mazda."""
FR_187	1	Inflation: unemployment benefits to be raised by 1.9% on April 1
FR_187	2	On Friday, several trade unions announced a 1.9% increase in unemployment insurance benefits on April 1.
FR_187	3	Decided by Unédic's Board of Directors, this exceptional boost is a direct consequence of inflation.
FR_187	4	"This is ""a first"", as until now there has been only one revaluation per year on July 1."
FR_187	5	Jobseekers eligible for back-to-work allowance (ARE) will receive a boost next month.
FR_187	6	On April 1, unemployment benefits will be raised by 1.9%, several trade unions announced on Friday.
FR_187	7	The decision was taken at a meeting of the Unédic board of directors.
FR_187	8	Read also This follows a collective initiative by the trade unions, which, in the face of galloping inflation and falling purchasing power for jobseekers, requested and obtained this re-evaluation, Force Ouvrière welcomed in a press release.
FR_187	9	Insufficient for the CGT.
FR_187	10	The union hailed this as a first, since until then there had been only one revaluation per year on July 1.
FR_187	11	However, the CGT deplored the fact that management had not conceded more than a 1.9% increase, which was totally out of step with the precariousness of the jobless and with increases in minimum social benefits and the minimum wage.
FR_187	12	The union abstained, but this did not prevent the increase from being adopted.
FR_187	13	This announcement comes as the government announced on Wednesday March 22 a 1.6% increase in social benefits (RSA, prime d'activité, family allowances, etc.) from April 1.
FR_187	14	A 1.6% rise in social benefits.
FR_187	15	This increase is based on the average monthly inflation rate over the past year, i.e. +5.6% compared with April 2022.
FR_187	16	But the actual increase in April 2023 has been reduced to +1.6%, as the government has taken into account the exceptional 4% increase that was granted early in July 2022, the ministry told AFP.
FR_187	17	Read also The Minister, Jean-Christophe Combe, announced this decision to solidarity associations on Tuesday at the first meeting of a unit dedicated to monitoring inflation, according to his office.
FR_187	18	This unit will meet again shortly to anticipate the measures and measures needed to protect the most vulnerable from rising prices, and to maintain a high level of vigilance against the risk of falling into poverty, the same source assured us.
FR_187	19	However, the representatives of the associations present told the Minister of their incomprehension at what they considered to be a grossly inadequate upgrade.
FR_187	20	Consumer prices rose by an average of 6.2% year-on-year, but by at least 14% to 15% on food and basic necessities.
FR_189	1	Soccer: Noël Le Graët expected at the Ministry of Sports this Friday
FR_189	2	"The reason why Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra called on the 80-year-old executive and his managing director, Florence Hardouin, for a meeting that sounds like a summons was to discuss ""various subjects"", from fan outbursts to the energy transition, not forgetting the forthcoming World Cup in Qatar (November 20-December 18)."
FR_189	3	"But perhaps also because current events demanded it. ""I don't receive them for tea, I don't receive them to tell me that everything's fine."
FR_189	4	"I receive them because I need to hear what they have to say,"" says the Minister."
FR_189	5	Last week, both Le Graët's management and his personality were heavily criticized in an article in the monthly magazine So Foot, which, on the basis of anonymous testimonials, alleged that Le Graët had sent sexual SMS messages to FFF employees.
FR_189	6	"The Federation reacted on Thursday, after the meeting of its executive committee, by announcing the filing of a complaint ""in defamation against the magazine So Foot because of the seriously defamatory imputations"" of the article."
FR_189	7	.
FR_189	8	"""I'm not minimizing anything that was reported by So Foot,"" Amélie Oudéa-Castéra told Le Parisien."
FR_189	9	Neither the Minister nor the FFF boss is expected to speak after their meeting on Friday, scheduled for 10 a.m. according to the ministerial agenda.
FR_189	10	"The affair, if true, is a thorny one for the ""3F"", put back on its feet by Le Graët after the nightmare of Les Bleus' strike in Knysna at the 2010 World Cup, and crowned by the world title eight years later in Moscow."
FR_189	11	.
FR_189	12	"""Inaction"" on harassment."
FR_189	13	"According to a source interviewed by So Foot, several women have resigned from the body in recent years because they felt ""sexually harassed, but also morally harassed""."
FR_189	14	"For its part, the professional players' union UNFP deplored the Federation's ""inaction"" in the fight against harassment, ""sexual or otherwise""."
FR_189	15	"He hopes that Friday's match will be ""an opportunity to put an end to harassment, the scourge of French soccer""."
FR_189	16	"Asked about the situation, Les Bleus coach Didier Deschamps admitted on Thursday that the current climate at the FFF was ""not the most appeased""."
FR_189	17	"But he also deplored what he described as a quest for ""buzz"". ""You know my relationship with the president, I spoke to him at length yesterday (Wednesday)."
FR_189	18	What do you want me to say?
FR_189	19	""", he declared in a press conference. ""The president is fine, he's in great shape."" Having arrived in 2011 and been re-elected in 2021 for another term, Le Graët is credited with having presided over the resurgence of the men's French team, thanks to the loyal duo he forms with Deschamps, while turning around the federal finances via a record contract with equipment manufacturer Nike."
FR_189	20	The women's game has also grown, with a surge in the number of registered players, despite Les Bleues' failure to reach the quarter-finals of the 2019 World Cup on home soil and the semi-finals of the Women's Euro last summer.
FR_189	21	Risky exits.
FR_189	22	His detractors, for their part, point to an authoritarian exercise of power, a lack of interest in amateur soccer (which he disputes), and governance undermined by conflicts surrounding the divisive Florence Hardouin.
FR_189	23	"In terms of communication, ""NLG"" has been guilty of a number of misguided outbursts, downplaying the problem of homophobia in stadiums and racism in soccer, which he claims ""doesn't exist or hardly exists""."
FR_189	24	"Her sexist statement about the dissensions between the Bleues, who ""can pull each other's hair out"" as long as they win, also made waves."
FR_189	25	"But the ""Menhir"", founding CEO of the Le Graët group (780 employees), which specializes in fish, preserves and frozen foods, remains unperturbed: recovered from lymphoid leukemia, expected in 2018, he brushed aside on Tuesday the possibility of handing over during his term of office. ""I have no intention of stopping."

FR_194	1	"""They lied"": Frontex targeted in report on illegal returns of migrants"
FR_194	2	A report by the European Anti-Fraud Office (Olaf), extracts from which have been published by the German newspaper, highlights the fact that Frontex, the border surveillance agency, was aware at an early stage of illegal returns of migrants to Greece.
FR_194	3	The former management even co-financed the sometimes brutal deportation of asylum seekers to Turkey.
FR_194	4	"Its director at the time, Fabrice Leggeri, was forced to resign at the end of April, following the conclusions of the investigators: ""Instead of preventing pushbacks, former boss Fabrice Leggeri and his colleagues concealed them."
FR_194	5	"They lied to the European Parliament and covered up the fact that the agency supported certain refoulements with European taxpayers' money""."
FR_194	6	Many details have been revealed, such as the time on August 5, 2020, when Greek coastguards towed an inflatable dinghy with thirty migrants on board not to Greece, but to Turkey.
FR_194	7	A Frontex plane on patrol filmed the scene.
FR_194	8	Frontex involved in more than a dozen refoulements.
FR_194	9	Several Frontex employees have testified that Fabrice Leggeri turned a blind eye to these illegal acts.
FR_194	10	"For example, one written note refers to the withdrawal of surveillance aircraft from the Aegean Sea, ""so as not to be a witness""."
FR_194	11	Olaf also reports that at least six Greek boats, co-financed by Frontex, were allegedly involved in more than a dozen refoulements between April and December 2020, something the former director has always denied.
FR_194	12	"Questioned following the publication of extracts from the report, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, Anitta Hipper, stressed that ""a series of measures"" had already been put in place to settle the question of the governance of the agency, headed since the beginning of July by the Latvian Aija Kalnaja."
FR_194	13	"So, ""In terms of on-the-spot work with the Greek authorities, there is progress on the ground"", adds Anitta Hipper, who also points to ""a new law proposal to guarantee a solid monitoring system"" for the treatment of asylum seekers in Greece."
FR_194	14	Greece denies any illegal refoulement.
FR_194	15	"In his seven years at the helm of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri has seen the agency considerably beefed up, and its staffing levels, with agents now armed, are set to reach While Greece has always denied any illegal refoulement at its borders, Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said on Thursday that he had only read ""the summary"" of the Olaf report, which he said ""does not directly blame Greece""."
FR_194	16	"He added to the media: ""We have the right to protect our borders."
FR_218	1	"How the French ""alt-right"" is appropriating the codes of TikTok, Instagram and YouTube"
FR_218	2	To spread their ideas, in the U.S. as in France, alt-right influencers have unsurprisingly adopted the grammar and predefined templates of YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.
FR_218	3	The term alt-right is complex to define.
FR_218	4	It can be understood as a generic term for a coalition of online activists operating mainly in English-speaking countries.
FR_218	5	In the research , the alt-right is seen as an alliance encompassing online troll culture, the masculinist movement and identitarians, with significant variations in influences and practices.
FR_218	6	A sense of civilizational decline.
FR_218	7	"The alt-right appeals specifically to younger generations who share a sense of civilizational decline correlated with ""immigrationist"", ""multiculturalist"" and, more recently, ""wokist"" thrusts."
FR_218	8	The frequent use of the terms reacosphere or fachosphere in the French media attests to the importance attached to this phenomenon in France.
FR_218	9	"For Philippe-Joseph Salazar, professor of rhetoric at the University of Cape Town and author of ""Suprémacistes."
FR_218	10	"L'Enquête mondiale chez les gourous de la droite identitaire"", the term ""fachosphere"" refers to the group of actors who, over the last ten years or so, have learned to exploit the Internet and redeploy ""grassroots"" activism, i.e. activism stemming from spontaneous mobilizations and favoring horizontal, participatory organization."
FR_218	11	In France, the media are showing a growing interest in a new galaxy of hexagonal ideologues who have set up camp on YouTube, Twitter or TikTok.
FR_218	12	"They wage a Gramscian-inspired metapolitical struggle - the idea that the battle is fought first and foremost on the cultural terrain - with the aim of developing an alternative imaginary, capable of competing with the ""politically correct"" conveyed by the mainstream media Make a ""cultural counter Canal+"" In a 2018 interview, the far-right youtuber, pamphleteer and influencer Papacito , already mentioned his desire to ""make a cultural counter Canal+."
FR_218	13	"Just as fun, but with more reactionary, patriotic ideas""."
FR_218	14	A world away from the star youtuber duo Mcfly and Carlito, with their depoliticized potted humor (which didn't prevent them from being received at the Élysée Palace), the influencers of the French alt-right convey politically-charged messages: Offering an alternative form of political socialization for young voters, these network ideologues oscillate between solo careers and coordinated activism.
FR_218	15	"With his headphones screwed on, he comments on current events in his ""Raptor Talks"" (capsules regularly topping 600,000 views) with a host of memes."

FR_231	1	Morocco: two years in prison for blogger accused of mocking the Koran
FR_231	2	A Moroccan blogger was sentenced this week to two years in prison for offending the Muslim religion.
FR_231	3	She had posted satirical comments on verses from the Koran on Facebook.
FR_231	4	In detention since July 15, Fatima Karim, a 39-year-old Moroccan woman, was sentenced on Monday by the courts of the Cherifian kingdom to two years in prison for offending the Muslim religion.
FR_231	5	He is accused of satirically commenting, in Arabic on his Facebook page, on verses from the Koran and hadiths of the Prophet Mohammed, which are considered sacred.
FR_231	6	Article 267-5 of the Moroccan Penal Code, under which Fatima Karim was convicted, punishes anyone who undermines the Muslim religion with six months to two years' imprisonment.
FR_231	7	The penalty may be increased to five years' imprisonment if the offence is committed in public, including by electronic means.
FR_231	8	The same article 267 severely punishes any attack on the monarchical regime and any incitement to undermine the kingdom's territorial integrity.

FR_M_032	1	RESTORING THE EXCELLENCE OF FRENCH SCHOOLS.
FR_M_032	2	Our country's situation in this area is a sign of the failure of policies pursued for more than half a century, and more seriously, the collapse of our education system is contributing to the downgrading of our country, the extent of which was revealed by the 2020-2021 crisis.
FR_M_032	3	Numerous international studies underline the fact that, over the last thirty years, the level of French pupils has plummeted in mathematics, reading and written expression.
FR_M_032	4	What's more, even though education policies have been geared towards reducing inequalities for the past fifty years, these inequalities continue to grow.
FR_M_032	5	The result is that almost 100,000 students leave the school system each year without any qualifications whatsoever.
FR_M_032	6	This situation is no accident.
FR_M_032	7	"It stems from an ideology, implemented with the ""collège unique"" in 1977."
FR_M_032	8	It is exacerbated by an allocation of financial resources that defies common sense.
FR_M_032	9	Our country devotes far too few resources to primary education, and compensates for this lack of investment by allocating very large sums to secondary education as a result of the massification of access to collège.
FR_M_032	10	First and foremost, French, mathematics and history will be given priority at primary level, with the number of teaching hours significantly increased (since 1966, the number of teaching hours has fallen by 20%).
FR_M_032	11	The government's limited measure of doubling the number of pupils in the lower grades will be extended to twenty in primary and thirty in secondary schools.
FR_M_032	12	In the first instance, this will undoubtedly mean recruiting more primary school teachers.
FR_M_032	13	In the medium term, this effort will be offset by the reduction in secondary school enrolments required as a result of the abolition of the single collège and the promotion of vocational courses.
FR_M_032	14	Transferring the bulk of the effort to primary schools is also a moral obligation, given the objectives of the far-reaching reform I'm calling for.
FR_M_032	15	"We also need to put an end to the illusions of the ""collège unique"", which has led to a drop in the average level of student achievement, and degraded teachers' missions and working conditions."
FR_M_032	16	The aim must be to ensure that students are properly assigned, and that they and their teachers are well looked after.
FR_M_032	17	I propose that our country should draw inspiration from the Swiss model: a level check at the end of primary school leading to level classes at the start of secondary school, enabling teaching to be adapted to the real needs of different groups of pupils.
FR_M_032	18	At the end of these three years, 80% of young people go on to vocational training by the age of 14.
FR_M_032	19	The results in terms of unemployment and matching skills to economic needs are highly satisfactory.
FR_M_032	20	As for the best students who have passed through vocational training, they are offered the chance to enter higher education if they wish, depending on the quality of their results.
FR_M_032	21	"Such a model should lead us to abandon the totally outdated objective of ""80% of an age group taking the baccalaureate"", and replace it with two objectives: 40% of young people in vocational training by the end of 3rd grade; and a match between training policies and the forecast needs of the economy."
FR_M_032	22	As I see it, the vocational stream is not just one that prepares students for manual jobs.
FR_M_032	23	It could include other professions, such as law, healthcare or personal assistance.
FR_M_032	24	"There can no longer be one ""queen channel"" and the others."
FR_M_032	25	The time has come to break with misconceptions.
FR_M_032	26	What has general education become today, if not a synonym for training that no longer leads to employment?
FR_M_032	27	As I mentioned earlier, overhauling the educational institution is a prerequisite for access to abundant employment.
FR_M_032	28	It is also the condition for the success of republican assimilation, which is more necessary than ever.
FR_M_032	29	Schools must once again become the crucible of assimilation in our country, through school programs, of course, but also through respect for the authority exercised over pupils.
FR_M_032	30	Significant and immediate sanctions will be put in place for parents whose children fail to be punctual or show the respect due to National Education staff.
HE_003	1	Strengthens the security of cloud services: Check Point acquired the start-up Protego for about 40 million dollars
HE_003	2	Check Point stated in its announcement that the purchase strengthens the security of its cloud services, using new technology to protect serverless applications.
HE_003	3	According to Check Point, it thereby becomes the first cyber protection provider in the world that provides a unified solution for the protection of cloud applications (Cloud Workload) and the management of the security configuration in the cloud (Cloud Posture), which enables continuous protection of serverless applications.
HE_003	4	Check Point further states that Protego provides technology that prevents malicious attacks on serverless applications &quot;at runtime&quot;, and prevents the implementation of vulnerable code in the production environment.
HE_003	5	Check Point will integrate the technology as part of its unified defense architecture, named Infinity, which protects networks, mobile devices, edge equipment, IoT components and cloud services.
HE_003	6	Check Point believes that the increasing use of serverless cloud technologies challenges the existing security concepts of cloud services and applications, and the transition to cloud-based applications entails exposure to security weaknesses and configuration errors, which require expanding cloud security services &quot;up to the level of the application, the function and even the software code&quot; , as defined by you.
HE_003	7	&quot;When implementing digital transformation and implementing cloud services, organizations need a new security concept to protect against the fifth and sixth generation of cyber attacks,&quot; said Dr. Dorit Dor, VP of Products, Research and Development at Check Point.
HE_003	8	&quot;The combination of serverless application protection capabilities within the CloudGuard platform, and the ability to leverage cloud security and compliance capabilities, allow us to provide organizations with unprecedented protection for their cloud environments.&quot;
HE_003	9	Protego was established by five founders: CEO Zion Gonen and board members Hillel Solo, Shelly Mor, Benny Zamor and Iti Harosh.
HE_003	10	Since its establishment in 2015, the company has raised an amount of 7 million dollars, so from the point of view of its investors, this is a very successful exit.
HE_003	11	Among the investors in Protego can be noted Gillot Capital and MizMaa Ventures.
HE_003	12	Check Point expects continued erosion of profit margins This is Check Point&#39;s fourth acquisition since the end of 2018 in Israel: it was preceded by the purchase of Dome9 in October 2018 in a larger deal, of approximately $175 million (plus an additional amount for options and blocked shares), for the company which deals with security technologies in the cloud; In January 2019, the ForceNock company that developed technology in the security of Web applications and application programming interfaces was acquired, in exchange for a few million dollars; And about three weeks ago, Cymplify, which deals with the protection of IoT products, was acquired in a deal estimated at several million dollars.
HE_003	13	In the meantime, the CFO of Check Point, Tal Payne, was a guest at a conference organized by Credit Suisse yesterday, where she said, among other things, that Check Point, like the entire industry, is in a period of transition.
HE_003	14	In her estimation, further erosion in the company&#39;s profit margins is expected, but not as sharp as this year.
HE_003	15	Payne points out that the performance improvement is taking longer than expected, as the company has invested in the last two years but has not yet seen the results of the investment (Credit Suisse believes that the reason for this is the very competitive environment), and in her estimation part of the return on the investment will come next year.
HE_003	16	Credit Suisse&#39;s recommendation for Check Point stock is &quot;Neutral&quot; with a target price of $110, which is 5.5% lower than the stock price on the Nasdaq.
HE_003	17	Check Point&#39;s market capitalization is $18.1 billion.
HE_005	1	Avi Simhon: Many people would not have gone to study biology if they had known what kind of salary Shaul Meridor expected of them at the Eli Horvitz conference: &quot;The education system will have to learn to manage money in order to get a budget&quot;.
HE_005	2	Roni Hezekiah: &quot;I estimate that the debt-GDP ratio will not increase in 2019, and will even decrease&quot;
HE_005	3	&quot;There are a lot of people who are going to study biology at university.
HE_005	4	If they knew what awaited them, they would not have gone to study it&quot; - said today (Tuesday) the Chairman of the National Economic Council, Prof. Avi Simhon, at the Eli Horvitz Conference on Economics and Society of the Israel Democracy Institute, held in Jerusalem.
HE_005	5	Simhon presented data according to which the average salary of bachelor&#39;s degree graduates in computer science at universities, working in the high-tech industry (in 2017), was NIS 28.3 thousand per month two years after their studies; The salary of economics or law graduates was lower than this by more than half (about NIS 13.3 thousand); And biology graduates earned an average of NIS 7,431 per month only two years after finishing their studies.
HE_005	6	According to Simhon, the universities are a bottleneck because of their limited ability to train workers in high-tech professions.
HE_005	7	&quot;The National Economic Council led a government decision that brought a lot of money to universities for computer science departments,&quot; he said.
HE_005	8	&quot;It managed to significantly increase the number of new students, and the Prime Minister instructed me to bring a government decision that would increase it even more.&quot;
HE_005	9	Ami Applebaum, chairman of the Innovation Authority, said: &quot;I was shocked to see the salary that graduates of biology studies receive.
HE_005	10	Israel is a leader in academia in the fields of pharma and life sciences, but we are not able to bring it to a state where we can realize it in Israel.&quot;
HE_005	11	The chairman of the Securities Authority, Anat Guetta, criticized the disconnection between the successful high-tech industry in Israel and the capital market.
HE_005	12	&quot;Our capital market is not a source of growth for technology companies,&quot; she said.
HE_005	13	&quot;Many of them choose to be sold to foreign companies, and those who choose to trade on the stock exchange do so overseas.
HE_005	14	As a government we have nothing to be proud of that Israel exports companies to foreign stock exchanges.
HE_005	15	This has a negative effect on the Israeli economy.&quot;
HE_005	16	&quot;We cannot reduce the government&#39;s expenses&quot; the head of budgets at the Ministry of Finance, Shaul Meridor, presented at the conference data according to which in the years 2006-2018 there was an increase of about 81% in the budget per student in the education system.
HE_005	17	According to him, &quot;There is no question that there was no match between the amount of money that went into the system, and the achievements that this system is supposed to bring our students to.
HE_005	18	It bothers us a lot.
HE_005	19	This system will have to know how to manage the money that comes into it in order to receive a budget - otherwise, the Accountant General at the Ministry of Finance, Roni Hezekiah, said that the continuous budget on which the government will begin work in January (budget 1/12) is expected to be in effect &quot;until the summer or early fall.
HE_005	20	The deficit will converge as a result, and will reach back to about 3% of GDP.
HE_005	21	This is apparently good - but only for the short term.
HE_005	22	In the long term, this will burden the government&#39;s operations, and will lead to the continued delay in promoting reforms.
HE_005	23	&quot;In recent years we have had a structural deficit of about 3%.
HE_005	24	The fact that the actual deficit was lower is attributed to one-time revenues.
HE_005	25	As much as there are, and I hope there will be in the future, they should be earmarked for debt reduction.
HE_005	26	In 2019, I assume we will converge on a deficit around the numerator&#39;s forecast, more or less 3.7%, and in my estimation the debt-to-product ratio - which increased in 2018 from 60.5% to 61% - will not increase this year, and will even decrease.
HE_005	27	Today the debt-to-product ratio is at a reasonable level, and as long as we know how to continue fiscal discipline and maintain high growth, we will keep it low.&quot;
HE_005	28	Hezekiah&#39;s current assessment of the change in the debt-GDP ratio in 2019 is more optimistic than the one he presented in the Knesset a few weeks ago.
HE_005	29	Then Hezekiah estimated that &quot;we predict an order of magnitude of no change up to an increase of 0.5 percentage point&quot;.
HE_005	30	According to Hezekiah, it is necessary to maintain the growth potential of the economy, to enable the necessary expenses in the coming years.
HE_005	31	&quot;There is one thing that is clear: we cannot reduce expenses.
HE_005	32	We are a young country, and we need to invest in all types of infrastructure.&quot;
HE_009	1	360 degree virtual reality
HE_009	2	The training of the general staff for fighting in Lebanon led by the &quot;Gesh&quot; formation and the Golani brigade, which lasted a week and was held at the Alykim military base, has come to an end.
HE_009	3	This is a major and central event in preparation for improving the competence and readiness for combat in Lebanon, and in the framework of which IDF commanders from the rank of lieutenant colonel and above were trained from the air, sea, land arms and all wings and commands.
HE_009	4	The purpose of the training is to form a knowledge base for the brigadier general and the general to train his subordinates in a more accurate and deadly manner, in preparation for possible combat in Lebanon.
HE_009	5	The special technological infrastructure that was established for it allows for the continued deepening and improvement of operational competence at the level of the MP, the MM and the MM, as well as the knowledge of the enemy&#39;s forces and preparations, the challenges of maneuvering on the northern front and the creation of a professional common language around the combat techniques adapted to the northern front.
HE_009	6	This will be accompanied by a preliminary part of writing a combat techniques book, as well as a deepening and intelligence study of the decree that all the commanders participating in the training were required to pass.
HE_009	7	In addition, during the month of August, all the brigade commanders went through a two-day preparation for further training, which included a discussion with the Chief of Staff, intelligence and military reviews alongside battle heritage from the Lebanon wars.
HE_009	8	The operational training consisted of three interactive stations, and one that combines walking in a simulated enemy village - when all of them incorporated advanced technological means into the content.
HE_009	9	In each of them, the commanders practiced as a combat team (division combat team) or as a combat team (battalion combat team) the entire cycle of battle procedure - planning from the enemy&#39;s sights, planning a battle plan for its components (maneuvering, fire, etc.), conducting a battle and debriefing.
HE_009	10	The stations will be operated by a general manager responsible for writing the scenarios and streaming the events during the practice together with a technological team from the companies &quot;Begira Systems Ltd&quot; and &quot;Sindiana Technologies&quot;, who helped the advanced effort to build an accurate and visual image of the battlefield.
HE_009	11	Each station (four in total) dealt with a different topic - defeating the offensive component, overcoming maneuver inhibitors and neutralizing an ambush, occupying a rural compound and a field station showing a Lebanese village and simulating walking in enemy territory.
HE_009	12	The POW in AP Elikim was transformed into a living Lebanese village through realistic scenery, actors and costumes, all in order to allow the commander to see and understand from his feet what the battlefield in Lebanon would look like.
HE_009	13	During the station, the commanders were shown the story of the village by actors - from the daily routine of the citizens which includes shopping in the market, praying in the mosque, children playing in the street and school students, to the routine of the enemy forces located in the village - the locations of the ammunition depots, the deployment of the fighters and more.
HE_009	14	Among the technological means, you can find a 360-degree virtual reality video - to explain to the commanders what the factors that will delay the maneuver in the next battle and how they will have to deal with them, a 360-degree virtual reality video is used that is viewed through VR glasses and illustrates Hezbollah&#39;s conduct on every his details
HE_009	15	Apart from that, the commanders were assisted by a 3D digital sand table, which has a touch screen that allows the commander practicing at the station to conduct the combat in a more accurate way of the terrain while seeing the enemy forces, our forces and the military.
HE_009	16	The training was divided into four stations dealing with the various aspects of the logistical response for each combat team, battalion and brigade, as well as the assembly areas.
HE_009	17	Each of them was composed of advanced AML displays as well as practical parts.
HE_009	18	Their purpose is to strengthen familiarity with the concept of logistics operations in the northern contour and the challenges of maneuvering on the northern front, with an emphasis on the threat posed to the logistics forces and the creation of a professional common language around the techniques for carrying out complex logistics operations.
HE_009	19	The training also reflected the concept of the logistics network developed in order to save time and provides availability of permanent means for the operational need.
HE_016	1	Netanyahu compared The Hague to Antiochus: &quot;New anti-Semitic decrees on the Jewish people&quot;
HE_016	2	In the meantime, the bi-ministerial team to handle the Hague Tribunal crisis met this evening at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem.
HE_016	3	The discussion was attended by a number of parties dealing with the issue, including the National Security Headquarters (NSH), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the IDF.
HE_016	4	It was reported that the discussion brought up the various options for action facing the State of Israel, and several recommendations were formulated for the political level.
HE_016	5	In the morning, the government held a discussion on the issue.
HE_016	6	The ministers heard a review by Attorney General Avichai Mandeblit on the consequences of the announcement on Israel and its implications.
HE_016	7	The government then approved the Prime Minister&#39;s request to impose confidentiality on the hearings on the International Criminal Court in The Hague according to Article 35 of the Basic Law of the Government.
HE_016	8	It was also decided that the entire discussion on the issue will be conducted in the political-security cabinet.
HE_016	9	It appears that Israel will not cooperate directly with the tribunal in The Hague, but it is not impossible that it will give the green light to Israeli officials to contact and raise the Israeli arguments, the main of which is that the tribunal does not have the authority to discuss the issue both because Israel is not a signatory to the Rome Convention and because the Palestinians are not a sovereign state. Therefore, they cannot submit claims to the court.
HE_016	10	In Israel there is a dispute as to whether it is possible to convince the three-judge tribunal to reject the recommendation of the prosecutor Pato Bensouda.
HE_016	11	There are those who believe that there is a good chance that the tribunal will reject Bensouda&#39;s recommendation just as it rejected her recommendation to open an investigation against American soldiers for committing war crimes in Afghanistan, following brutal pressure and threats exerted by the Americans to dry up the sources of funding for the tribunal and prevent its judges from entering US territory.
HE_016	12	President Donald Trump has previously threatened to take sanctions against the Hague Tribunal if it opens an investigation into war crimes against the US and Israel.
HE_016	13	That is why Israel intends to mobilize first and foremost the USA and other countries including Britain, Russia, Australia and others - whose opinion is not comfortable with what is happening at the court and they also fear a precedent that an investigation will be opened against a western democratic country that has an independent judicial system.
HE_016	14	Netanyahu also addressed the issue at the beginning of the government meeting, saying that &quot;on Friday, the Hague Tribunal finally became a weapon against the State of Israel.
HE_016	15	There are three absurdities in the prosecutor&#39;s decision.
HE_016	16	The court was established after the horrors of World War II and is designed to deal with problems that countries raise against war crimes such as genocide, and it is designed to do this in countries that do not have legal systems.
HE_016	17	They took the case of the Palestinians, who by all accounts do not have a state, and came to accuse the only democracy in the Middle East over which the court has no authority at all.&quot;
HE_016	18	&quot;A second absurdity - the prosecutor&#39;s decision works against the historical truth,&quot; Netanyahu added.
HE_016	19	&quot;To turn the fact that Jews live in their own country into a war crime is an absurdity that it is difficult to say there is anything greater than it.
HE_016	20	The prosecutor&#39;s decision is contrary to the truth, it is terrible hypocrisy.
HE_016	21	We will continue to fight against these absurdities, we will fight for our rights with all the tools at our disposal.&quot;
HE_016	22	Israel&#39;s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said this morning in an interview with the Ynet studio that this is the result of &quot;diplomatic terrorism&quot; on the part of the Palestinians, and announced that Israel is fighting to prevent the investigation from going ahead.
HE_016	23	Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced on Friday that a preliminary investigation shows that there are grounds for allegations of war crimes in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
HE_016	24	However, she did not specifically state who was committing these crimes.
HE_016	25	It asked the Hague Tribunal for an opinion that would confirm its authority to open a full investigation within 120 days.
HE_016	26	In its efforts to convince the court to reject the plaintiff&#39;s request, Israel is expected to mobilize the US and other factors to apply pressure and reject the move.
HE_016	27	The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yisrael Katz, at the end of the week instructed the people of his office to formulate recommendations in the coming days for the continuation of the confrontation with the International Court of Justice, and today the first meeting on the matter will take place.
HE_016	28	Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who published an opinion stating that the tribunal has no jurisdiction over Israel, last night rejected the prosecutor&#39;s decision in The Hague.
HE_016	29	&quot;The court does not and cannot have jurisdiction for clear legal reasons, and no amount of legal malfeasance will change that,&quot; said the ombudsman.
HE_016	30	Mandelblit explained that the International Court of Justice has no authority in Israel, because it is a country with functional and independent enforcement and judicial systems, while &quot;the Court was supposed to deal with the most serious atrocities in places where the rule of law has collapsed.&quot;
HE_016	31	Transport Minister Bezalel Smotrich called on the Prime Minister this evening to bring a decision for the government&#39;s approval to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley - in response to the announcement of the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court.
HE_016	32	&quot;I have no doubt that the time has come to take significant steps at this time and bring to the government a decision regarding the decision of Israeli sovereignty in the Jordan Valley, a decision that above all will express and clarify to the Palestinian Authority, the Attorney General and the Court that the territories of the historic Land of Israel are an inseparable part of the sovereign State of Israel.
HE_016	33	The words of the first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion are already known in reference to the anti-Israeli decision made at the Andong conference: &#39;Our future does not depend on what the Gentiles will say, but on what the Jews will do,&#39;&quot; Smotrich wrote to Netanyahu.
HE_022	1	Report: The Qatari money will be transferred to Gaza tomorrow; The restrictions on goods will be removed
HE_022	2	.
HE_022	3	According to reports in the Arab world, on Monday the understandings between Israel and the Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, reached through the mediation of Egypt and the UN, will enter into force.
HE_022	4	Besides the introduction of the Qatari money, the restrictions on import and export from the Strip will be removed, and the fishing areas will be re-expanded.
HE_022	5	Haniyeh called the Emir of Qatar to thank him
HE_022	6	Tomorrow a series of economic reliefs will come into effect in the Gaza Strip - this is what the Arab newspaper &quot;A-Sharq al-Awasat&quot; in London reported today (Sunday).
HE_022	7	Several sources told the newspaper that, among other things, an agreement was reached between Israel and the Palestinians, mediated by Egypt, on the introduction of Qatari money into the Strip on Monday, as well as the removal of the receipts for the introduction of goods and exports from the Strip.
HE_022	8	Agreements were also reached on the re-expansion of the fishing grounds to 15 miles in certain sections of the coastal strip in Gaza, and on the introduction of fuels financed by the Qatari government to operate the power plant in the Strip.
HE_022	9	It was also reported that in exchange for concessions, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip agreed to stop attacks against Israel, curb the demonstrations at the Gaza border and stop using incendiary balloons.
HE_022	10	According to the report, this is only an intermediate stage.
HE_022	11	If the understandings are indeed implemented on the ground, the parties will discuss a deal for the exchange of captives and prisoners, as well as infrastructure restoration projects that will include a security crossing to the bank and a sea port.
HE_022	12	In the next two days, the Qatari ambassador and the UN envoy to the Middle East, Nikolai Mladenov, are scheduled to arrive in Gaza to oversee the distribution of $30 million - the Qatari grant to the Hamas government.
HE_022	13	for further reading:
HE_022	14	The Chairman of the Political Bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, spoke on the phone with the Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and thanked him for the grant in the amount of 480 million dollars and congratulated him on the occasion of the month of Ramadan.
HE_022	15	The Emir of Qatar also congratulated Haniya and the Palestinian people and emphasized Qatar&#39;s support for the Palestinian people and its efforts to end their suffering.
HE_022	16	Yesterday, a member of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Jihad, Khaled al-Batash, warned Israel against manipulating the implementation of the agreements to lift the blockade from the Gaza Strip, which were reached under the auspices of Egypt and the United Nations.
HE_022	17	According to him, &quot;If Israel does not implement the Egyptian understandings, Jihad has the ability to resist that is able to force it to implement them, protect the people and protect the return marches that will continue until the goals are achieved.&quot;
HE_022	18	The official called on Egypt to follow the implementation of the understandings reached with Israel mediated by Cairo and it was said that &quot;pressure must be exerted on Israel to implement its obligations, including the cessation of shooting at the demonstrators in the return processions.&quot;
HE_022	19	Yesterday, about 6,000 Palestinians participated in demonstrations in three centers along the border of the Gaza Strip with Israel.
HE_022	20	The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that one young man was killed, 24-year-old Abdullah Jumaa Abdel-Aal, and 30 Palestinians were injured in the clashes, including four children and a medic.
HE_022	21	Palestinian media even reported that two rockets had been launched into Nahal Oz, but no red alert was sounded, and apparently it fell in the Gaza Strip.
HE_022	22	Al-Batash added that &quot;the last campaign drew a new equation according to which the resistance will never accept that Israel behaves aggressively towards the people of Gaza when and how it wants.
HE_022	23	This equation emphasizes that the Palestinian resistance through the factions, led by the Al-Qassam Brigades and the Al-Quds Companies, can force its word with all its might, and this is reflected in the strength and power of the fire that resulted in the enemy rushing to request a ceasefire and return to understanding.
HE_030	1	You must not give up the VATML
HE_030	2	The National Committee for the Planning and Construction of Preferred Housing Complexes (HotML) was established by law following the government&#39;s efforts to deal with the housing crisis in Israel.
HE_030	3	The lack of apartments and available land led to a considerable increase in housing prices, which necessitated an emergency plan aimed at encouraging and approving large construction plans on state land at a national level in a fast and effective manner.
HE_030	4	The HTMAL&#39;s ability to enforce and bypass the existing planning committees, a national &quot;super committee&quot; with extensive powers, led to a change in atmosphere that also had a positive effect on the other planning committees who realized that it was possible to act faster and more efficiently, without harming the quality of the planning.
HE_030	5	In contrast to the various planning committees, which were usually not characterized by excessive efficiency and often delayed plans, among other things, in view of a lack of communication between the local and district committees, the HTMAL proved to be an efficient and professional system that was able to promote broad planning and even bring plans to deposit in very short periods of time, and this without giving up The need to go down to small details and an in-depth discussion of each plan.
HE_030	6	The real source of the HOTML&#39;s power, as a supreme planning institution, is in the extensive powers it has received, the short (almost immediate) timetables and the way the discussions are conducted - where sometimes in one discussion (however long) all the necessary feedback and references are heard, from the various consultants, for the plan in preparation for its submission .
HE_030	7	This way is a refreshing change.
HE_030	8	Up until now, we have been accustomed, almost as if by fate, to prolonged, prolonged discussions, with long periods of time between discussions, to the point of the formation of incomplete, incoherent plans, patchwork upon patchwork, in view of the passage of time, when during the waiting time until the approval of a plan, in the meantime And city engineers change, committee members leave and some of the plans, by the time they come into force - are no longer relevant.
HE_030	9	The Hotmal, by its very existence and the way it conducts itself, caused a deep internalization of the housing crisis and the need to deal with the lack of supply of available residential land.
HE_030	10	It operates in the broadest sense: planning entire neighborhoods and a harmonious planning approach on a large and comprehensive scale, taking into account infrastructure, development and complex planning solutions, and providing a professional response that the local committees did not know how to deal with.
HE_030	11	Hotmail as a tool for promoting urban renewal.
HE_030	12	The HTML has also proven itself to be an effective instrument in approving plans for urban renewal - plans that are usually perceived as large, complex, cumbersome and that require a long time to be approved.
HE_030	13	For example, in two plans that our office accompanies in Lod and Kiryat Gat, with an aggregate scope of about 6,000 housing, commercial and office units, the committee brought about the deposit of the plans in a period of only about six months.
HE_030	14	A period of time that was in the nature of fantasy before the establishment of Hotmail.
HE_030	15	As a firm that is heavily involved in the HTML discussions and accompanies a number of extensive and complex plans, both in open areas and in urban renewal, I can testify that these are very professional and efficient discussions and with a great desire to find creative solutions that allow the projects to get off the ground quickly and without shortcuts.
HE_030	16	Return transactions.
HE_030	17	It is important to say that the HTML was also found to be effective in promoting planning complexes within the framework of land restitution transactions that had undergone a change of use and were stuck for many years in legal battles between tenants (kibbutzim, moshavim, farmers) and the Israel Lands Authority.
HE_030	18	Following the RMI decision 1470, the lessees were given financial compensation as well as the right of initiative with respect to part of the land in such a way that all parties came out of the matter as tenants, when the planning procedure moved to the accelerated track of the HOTML.
HE_030	19	In preparation for the establishment of a new government, and the possible entry of a new minister who will be responsible for the director of planning in the Ministry of Finance or another ministry, it is important to note that the construction industry needs stability and before making a decision to play up the cards and adopt new tools as a solution to the housing crisis, the effectiveness of the existing tools must be checked and the The best of it, such as the VATML.
HE_033	1	Putin and Erdogan agreed that the Turkish army could continue to operate in Syria at a distance of 32 km from the border
HE_033	2	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed today (Tuesday) that the Turkish military operation in Syria could continue 32 kilometers from the border, the Russian Foreign Minister said at the end of a meeting between the two presidents.
HE_033	3	A senior Turkish official added that Turkey and Russia reached an &quot;excellent&quot; agreement on Syria.
HE_033	4	According to the official, the agreement deals with the establishment of a &quot;security zone free from terrorism&quot; a wording that is consistent with the way Turkey describes the Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.
HE_033	5	Putin said at the end of the meeting that his conversation with Erdogan produced significant decisions for Syria.
HE_033	6	According to him, Russia thinks that the origin of the separatist ideas in northern Syria lies with foreign forces.
HE_033	7	The two presidents met in Sochi against the background of the end of the ceasefire in the Turkish military operation in northern Syria, which was set for today at 22:00.
HE_033	8	Assad visits military forces in the town of Habit in Idlib, today AFP.
HE_033	9	Before the meeting, Erdogan said that Turkey will &quot;resolutely&quot; continue the military operation after the end of the cease-fire reached by the US mediation - this, according to him, in the event that Washington&#39;s promises are not fulfilled.
HE_033	10	Erdogan added that 800 Kurdish fighters had evacuated from the area occupied by Turkey in northern Syria, but 1,300 other fighters had not, contrary to what she was promised would happen.
HE_033	11	Turkey has announced that the fighters of the Kurdish YPG militia must leave the &quot;security zone&quot; that Ankara wants to establish on its border with Syria.
HE_033	12	Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization with ties to the Kurdish underground, PKK, which operates in southeastern Turkey against the local security forces.
HE_033	13	Contrary to the Turkish announcement, a senior Kurdish official in Syria said today that his forces finished withdrawing from the border area before the end of the ceasefire, and that the Turkish forces and their allies are continuing their military activities in northeastern Syria even outside the area from which it was determined that the Kurds would withdraw.
HE_033	14	According to the Kurdish announcement, the fighters withdrew from a strip 120 kilometers long between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tel Abid.
HE_033	15	It was also reported that the Turkish forces are also operating outside this area, and that they have taken over 15 Kurdish villages near the town of Kobani.
HE_033	16	AFP.
HE_033	17	A senior administration official in Washington announced that the commander of the Kurdish forces informed the US military of the completion of their obligations in accordance with the cease-fire agreement.
HE_033	18	According to him, Washington and Ankara are making sure that the Kurdish withdrawal is complete, with the aim of ensuring that the Turkish ceasefire becomes a final freeze of the military campaign.
HE_033	19	In addition, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan a &quot;thief&quot;, the Syrian news agency SANA reported today.
HE_033	20	&quot;Erdoğan was a thief, he robbed factories, wheat and oil, and today he is a land robber,&quot; Assad was quoted as saying by his country&#39;s state news agency when he visited his army forces in the Idlib region for the first time since the start of the war.
HE_033	21	&quot;All areas in Syria have the same importance,&quot; Assad said in the town of Habit, referring to the Turkish army&#39;s invasion of northeastern Syria at the beginning of the month.
HE_033	22	In the photos published by the Syrian media, Assad is seen in a military position near officers and soldiers in the Idlib area.
HE_033	23	While the US forces are withdrawing from Syria and making their way into Iraq, the Iraqi army announced today that the American forces do not have permission to stay in the country and can use it as a transit point and nothing else.
HE_033	24	The Iraqi army&#39;s statement contradicts the Pentagon&#39;s statement that all the thousand soldiers who withdrew from northern Syria are expected to move to western Iraq and continue the operation against the &quot;Islamic State&quot; (ISIS) and &quot;help defend Iraq&quot;.
HE_033	25	A senior official at the US Department of Defense said afterwards that the situation on the ground is fluid and that the US military&#39;s plans may change.
HE_033	26	&quot;All American forces that have withdrawn from Syria have been given permission to enter the Kurdistan region so that they can be withdrawn from Iraq.
HE_033	27	These forces were not given permission to stay inside Iraq,&quot; the Iraqi army said in a statement it published.
HE_033	28	At the moment it is not clear whether the American forces will use Iraq as a base to carry out ground operations in Syria as well as airstrikes against ISIS members.
HE_033	29	The thousand soldiers who left Syria and entered Iraq joined more than 5,000 American soldiers already stationed in the Arab country and their job is to train the local security forces and ensure that ISIS does not re-establish its power in the country.

HE_044	2	Red alarms deafened throughout the evening (Sunday) the Ashkelon area, Sderot and the Gaza Strip, after several rocket barrages were fired from the Gaza Strip.
HE_044	3	The event came in the background of the incident that happened on the Gaza border, in which two Islamic Jihad terrorists were killed by IDF forces, after they tried to plant an explosive device.
HE_044	4	A report was received from residents of the area about intense explosions that deafened the area, apparently due to interceptions of the &quot;Iron Dome&quot; system.
HE_044	5	The MDA spokeswoman updates that no reports of bodily injuries have been received, and the Ashkelon Coast Regional Council stated that no falls were found in their territory.
HE_044	6	Following the reports of the various sources, the IDF spokesman published a statement in which he confirms the detection of about 20 launches into Israeli territory, as well as the interception of ten of them by the air defense fighters.

HE_044	8	In response to the shooting, the spokesperson of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza published a response according to which the attack exercises &quot;the right of the Palestinian resistance to respond to the crimes of the Israeli occupation&quot;.
HE_044	9	They also added that &quot;this morning&#39;s event and the abuse of the Palestinian body with a bulldozer required a response and the firing of the rockets this evening is a response to the crime committed by the Zionist enemy.&quot;
HE_044	10	Later in the evening, the organization took responsibility for shooting at the Israeli settlements.
HE_044	11	The spokesman for the Islamic Jihad in Gaza: &quot;The right of the Palestinian resistance to respond to the crimes of the Israeli occupation.
HE_044	12	The incident this morning and the abuse of the Palestinian body by means of a bulldozer (the Jihad terrorist) required a response and the firing of the rockets this evening is a response to the crime committed by the Zionist enemy&#39;&#39;/ Mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, ordered the residents of the city to stay near the protected areas following the heavy shooting.
HE_044	13	&quot;As of this moment there are no special instructions from the security authorities, but from past experience I recommend staying near protected areas,&quot; said Davidi in a video he shared on the city&#39;s Facebook pages.
HE_044	14	&quot;I will continue and update you on any new developments or instructions.

HE_044	21	The municipality also stated that the service center for residents has opened and that it is staffed with social workers and professional staff and is available for residents&#39; inquiries.
HE_044	22	The political system began to react to the shooting incidents.
HE_044	23	The chairman of the Labor party-Gesher-Mertz said that &quot;the barrage of fire tonight is another failure of Netanyahu and his defense ministers in recent years who insists on managing reality instead of changing it.
HE_044	24	Without a strategy, the problem will not be solved.
HE_044	25	Without a policy - Hamas and the other terrorist organizations will continue to determine the height of the flames according to their needs.&quot;
HE_044	26	Earlier, Defense Minister Naftali Bennett responded to the incident that happened this morning at the border of the Gaza Strip, in which the IDF killed two terrorists who tried to place an explosive device on the perimeter fence, and which later developed into a conflict between the IDF and the Islamic Jihad organization over the bodies there.
HE_044	27	Abu Hamza, the spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, threatened Israel following the elimination of the two terrorists who tried to place a bomb on the perimeter fence, saying that &quot;the Zionist enemy attacked one of our fighters inside the Gaza Strip in a barbaric and criminal manner.
HE_044	28	This is clear aggression and the enemy must bear the consequences.&quot;
HE_044	29	&quot;We are tired of the hypocritical criticism of the left against the &#39;inhumanity&#39; of using a bulldozer to bring us the body of a terrorist who tried to murder Israelis,&quot; Bennett said.
HE_044	30	&quot;Gentlemen, beauties of the soul: you are not humane.
HE_044	31	Hamas holds the bodies of Hadar and Oron.
HE_044	32	I support the IDF who eliminated the terrorists and collected the body.
HE_044	33	This is how it should be and this is how we will do it.
HE_044	34	We will act strongly against terrorists.&#39;
HE_049	1	Opening shopping malls and picking up from restaurants: the reliefs the government will decide on tonight
HE_049	2	The government will discuss tonight (Thursday) the opening of additional sectors in the economy after the restrictions imposed on the public as part of the Corona crisis.
HE_049	3	According to the agreements being formed between the Ministries of Finance and Health, it appears that all street shops and open shopping centers will be opened, including clothing and footwear stores.
HE_049	4	Also, it appears that a work permit will also be given to hairdressers - but not to beauticians and beauty salons.
HE_049	5	Self-collection from restaurants, &quot;take-away&quot;, is also expected to be approved.
HE_049	6	During the discussions that took place today ahead of the government meeting, several disagreements arose between the ministries: in the Ministry of Health they agreed on the return of the book work, but opposed the return of the beauticians.
HE_049	7	Also, during the discussions, representatives of the Ministry of Finance insisted on opening fashion and footwear stores, and the Ministry of Health initially opposed this.
HE_049	8	In addition to this, the Treasury contacted the malls and asked them to prepare for the opening with an application for the registration of buyers.
HE_049	9	Another topic that was on the agenda in the discussions, but is not expected to come up for discussion tonight, is the return of the education system.
HE_049	10	The ministries of finance and education are demanding that the education system be gradually restored after Independence Day, by a target date of May 3.
HE_049	11	According to the plan, kindergartens and lower grades will initially be returned in small groups.
HE_049	12	Earlier, the Ministry of Economy also formulated a series of recommendations for the meeting, which will take place in light of the pressure exerted by the ministers in the cabinet discussion yesterday, but due to its preoccupation with the restrictions that will be imposed on the days of remembrance, independence and the Ramadan holiday - the handling of the arguments was postponed for today.
HE_049	13	In this context, Economy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) is expected to present the demands as raised on behalf of his office, according to which more businesses should be allowed to return to regular work alongside dealing with the spread of the corona virus.
HE_049	14	At the top of the list was the demand to open the open shopping complexes (known as &quot;BIG&quot;).
HE_049	15	According to the ministry, although the facilities are not defined as prohibited in the current regulations, the interpretation of the Ministry of Health holds that they are included under the definition of &quot;mall&quot;, which creates a lot of confusion and an overly broad interpretation.
HE_049	16	&quot;Since the opening of shops on the street is allowed, it does not seem reasonable to prevent the opening of shops in shopping complexes&quot;, said the Ministry of Economy, emphasizing: &quot;A shopping complex is not a closed complex, it is spread out much more than the street, therefore the amendment is requested.&quot;
HE_049	17	It was also noted that supermarkets and pharmacies are active in these centers anyway, so there is no logic in preventing the rest of the open complex from operating.
HE_049	18	The rest of the recommendations of the Ministry of Economy concern other industries, which according to the Ministry&#39;s officials, &quot;the reason for their omission&quot; from the list of permitted businesses is not clear, including car washes, money changers, lottery booths, agencies and lots for the sale of vehicles and nurseries.
HE_049	19	The office claimed that the reason for their closure is not clear, since most of them have buffering conditions between the customers and the sellers, or alternatively they have open spaces similar to other businesses that are currently open anyway, such as garages and gas stations.
HE_049	20	The office also recommended that the stores for baby products be opened, since this is an essential area for citizens and that there are baby furniture stores that are allowed to open anyway and also sell toys and baby equipment, and a feeling of discrimination is created.
HE_049	21	&quot;The stores can meet the conditions set for stores selling household items,&quot; it says.
HE_049	22	Books and therapists: &quot;to prevent a black market&quot; Similar to the Treasury&#39;s demand from the Ministry of Health, a significant part of the list of recommendations of the Ministry of Economy concerns the work of the owners of barbershops, cosmetic salons and alternative treatments.
HE_049	23	These industries have been causing controversy for a long time in the discussions on the exit strategy, and in the discussion that took place yesterday, Finance Minister Kahlon and Minister Cohen called for their regulation, fearing the development of a &quot;black market&quot; in customers&#39; homes, without any compliance with the health regulations required in the fight against Corona.
HE_049	24	&quot;These businesses should be allowed to open, while defining clear regulations for them,&quot; said the Ministry of Economy.
HE_049	25	&quot;By not approving these types of service providers, they not only encourage non-compliance with the hygiene rules and guidelines, since being careful at home will not be the same as being careful in a business, but actually support cash and &#39;black&#39; payments, without reporting income.&quot;
HE_049	26	The Ministry of Economy added that they know that the phenomenon is expanding, and that by the very fact of the disappearance of the revenues, this harms the state coffers.
HE_049	27	Apart from these, the Ministry of Economy is calling for the amendment of regulations for service providers in the customer&#39;s home and in the public space, including for example driving instructors, private tutors, babysitters, repairmen, gardeners, medical therapists, sales agents, dog walkers, and more.
HE_049	28	According to the ministry, there are currently no clear instructions for these service providers, and that they should be allowed to return to work.
HE_049	29	&quot;The public needs them, and uses them with reduced adherence to the guidelines,&quot; they said.
HE_049	30	Therefore, this should be allowed while amending the installation so that they require adherence to the health guidelines, &quot;including frequent disinfection of work tools, wearing a mask and gloves, and maintaining a distance of two meters between people, as much as possible&quot;.
HE_049	31	If a grocery store can, why not an ice cream parlor?
HE_049	32	In the continuation of the recommendations document, they called on the Ministry of Economy to allow pre-order pickup from restaurants and ice cream parlors.
HE_049	33	The office justified this by saying that there is no entrance to the place, and that this is similar to delivering a shipment.
HE_049	34	&quot;It can be done &#39;one by one&#39;, to serve the industries currently working, and also to expand the activity without increasing the risk,&quot; they said.
HE_049	35	&quot;If a grocery store can sell closed ice creams, why can&#39;t an ice cream parlor sell closed boxes of ice cream?
HE_049	36	If a bakery can sell pastries in &quot;take away&quot;, why can&#39;t a restaurant that also sells pastries?&quot;.
HE_049	37	Also, the people of the Ministry of Economy called for an increase in the number of customers allowed in large and spacious stores where it is possible to maintain a distance between people beyond the limit of four customers per active cash register.
HE_049	38	&quot;We recommend expanding the definition, so that in a large store they can bring in a customer for every ten square meters,&quot; they said.
HE_049	39	&quot;Currently, the situation relates similarly to a 400-meter store and a 2,500-meter store - a situation that is unreasonable and unnecessary.&quot;
HE_055	1	The shortage of ventilators has been fully exposed: only 1,437 ventilators are available
HE_055	2	Against the backdrop of the spread of the corona crisis in Israel, the failure of ventilators in hospitals has been fully exposed.
HE_055	3	Ahead of the meeting this morning (Thursday) of the Knesset&#39;s special committee to deal with the virus, the Knesset&#39;s research and information center submitted a report with the latest data.
HE_055	4	As of today, there are 2,173 ventilators in Israel, of which about a third (708) are in use, another 28 are defective and only 1,437 are available.
HE_055	5	The Ministry of Health began purchasing ventilators.
HE_055	6	It is not yet clear how many will be purchased and who will operate them.
HE_055	7	This morning the number of confirmed carriers of the corona virus in Israel rose to 2,495, of which 41 are hospitalized in serious condition.
HE_055	8	In the discussion, the chairman of the committee, Ofer Shelah, stated that &quot;we are not getting satisfactory answers to all the things&quot;.
HE_055	9	Director General of the Ministry of Health Moshe Bar Siman Tov emphasized: &quot;This event is a tsunami that cannot be prepared for.&quot;
HE_055	10	He then addressed the issue of the machines: &quot;Yesterday there were about 1,500 machines.
HE_055	11	There are about 70 more ventilators that are in the private system that we will use as well.
HE_055	12	There are another 800-900 machines from the army that I hope will all be available.
HE_055	13	And we are making some more efforts and purchasing from abroad.
HE_055	14	The second thing is to manufacture machines in Israel.
HE_055	15	We are working on it with full vigor with Israeli companies.
HE_055	16	I plan on this giving me 2,300 machines.
HE_055	17	There is no defense industry or force in the State of Israel that is not mobilized for this task, whether it is to produce or to buy.&quot;
HE_055	18	When MK Shelah asked how long it takes to produce such a machine, Bar Siman Tov answered: &quot;It takes time.&quot;
HE_055	19	Regarding the continuation of the struggle, he said: &quot;After Passover, we want to loosen the economy a little.
HE_055	20	This is the strategy.
HE_055	21	Until then, they want to lower the number of seriously ill patients.
HE_055	22	The two weeks we enter in preparation for Pesach are critical.
HE_055	23	We are very afraid of Pesach and very afraid of Ramadan.
HE_055	24	People leave the house, gather together, and this is very dangerous.&quot;
HE_055	25	The committee is meeting against the background of the worsening of the guidelines restricting the public.
HE_055	26	At its head is MK Efr Selah (Blue and White).
HE_055	27	Among others, the director general of the Ministry of Finance, Shai Babad, and the head of the National Security Council, Meir Ben Shabat, are participating in the meeting.
HE_055	28	Bar Siman Tov: &quot;There are hundreds of thousands of people in housing settings with a high level of vulnerability to violence.
HE_055	29	I am very disturbed when I look from where the danger can erupt.
HE_055	30	What we can do now is bring in the rear command.
HE_055	31	We asked for help from the Ministry of Defense.&quot;
HE_055	32	Regarding the elderly who are in sheltered housing in Nofim, he said: &quot;We will sample the Nofim population in full.
HE_055	33	It&#39;s a flashlight that shines on a certain place.&quot;
HE_055	34	Bar Siman Tov commented on the figure on the patients in serious condition and said that almost all of them are breathing: &quot;If I look at the rate for a moment, between the 21st and 22nd of the month we had about 1,000 infections, and we passed the 2,000 mark after three days.
HE_055	35	We are in a situation where the number of patients doubles every three days.&quot;
HE_055	36	MK Shelah: &quot;The question is whether this is an exponential spread of the tests or of the patients.
HE_055	37	Do you have an estimate of how many patients there really are?
HE_055	38	Because 2,500 is because they were tested.
HE_055	39	The question arises as to how many corona patients there really are.&quot;
HE_055	40	Bar Siman Tov: &quot;The number that is important to look at, the number in which deviations are very limited, is the number of seriously ill patients.
HE_055	41	I look at the number of seriously ill patients and the rate of increase in their number.&quot;
HE_055	42	Send: &quot;If the number of patients doubles every few days, then so does the number of seriously ill patients?&quot;
HE_055	43	Bar Siman Tov: &quot;The curve for the seriously ill is also in some kind of exponent, because in the end the disease has an incubation period of up to two weeks.
HE_055	44	There are some things that really bother us.
HE_055	45	The first, we find ourselves with the numbers going up much faster.
HE_055	46	Our goal is to lower the curve.&quot;
HE_061	1	Insolvency and Financial Rehabilitation Law: What is its effect on a debtor whose debt is higher than 150 thousand NIS?
HE_061	2	On September 15, 2019, the new law entered into force, which anchors and regulates in law the new bankruptcy procedures, which are now known as &quot;insolvency and financial rehabilitation procedures&quot;.
HE_061	3	Among the stated goals of the new law are prioritizing the financial rehabilitation of the debtors, increasing the amounts of debts that the creditors will receive, and even shortening (to the extent possible) the bureaucratic procedures involved in insolvency procedures.
HE_061	4	In cases where the amount of debts accumulates and exceeds NIS 150,000, the party responsible for handling these cases on behalf of the state is the &quot;Commissioner for Insolvency and Economic Rehabilitation Procedures&quot; (also known as the &quot;Official Collector&quot; in the bankruptcy procedures that were opened before the law came into effect).
HE_061	5	According to the new law, the legal court in which the proceedings are conducted is the Magistrate&#39;s Court, while in the bankruptcy proceedings opened before the new law came into effect, these proceedings were conducted in the district court.
HE_067	1	The expected changes in the Corona Law: the authority of the police will be limited, the Knesset&#39;s audit will be strengthened
HE_067	2	The memorandum of the law, which drew a lot of public criticism, is expected to undergo changes before it comes up for discussion in the Committee of Ministers.
HE_067	3	According to legal sources, the section authorizing police officers to enter homes without a warrant is expected to be deleted.
HE_067	4	It was also considered that in some cases the Knesset would have to pre-approve some of the restrictions set by the government.
HE_067	5	The memorandum of law designed to authorize the government to deal with the corona crisis instead of emergency regulations, which caused a great stir, is expected to undergo changes.
HE_067	6	Legal officials familiar with the legislative process told Walla that it appears that the authorization of police officers to enter a residence will be removed from the memorandum before it is discussed in the Ministerial Committee for Legislation.
HE_067	7	It may remain possible to authorize police officers to enter homes - only through a court order and in light of suspicion of a serious violation of the guidelines.
HE_067	8	Another change that is on the agenda is expected to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the most offensive restrictions on human rights - restrictions on activity in private space, such as limiting the number of passengers in a car, and restrictions on activity in public space, such as a ban on staying in parks or on beaches.
HE_067	9	The memorandum states that these instructions will be limited to a period of 14 days, but the government can extend it at any time.
HE_067	10	The change being considered is that after a certain period, a committee of the Knesset will have to approve the extension of the ban in advance, and will not only be able to cancel it retroactively.
HE_067	11	The Corona Law Memorandum published last Thursday was formulated in accordance with the position of Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, and the comments of High Court judges, who urged the government to stop the extensive use of emergency regulations, and replace them with legislation.
HE_067	12	Almost all of the restrictions imposed by the government on the public in recent months as part of the fight against Corona - such as restrictions on leaving homes or opening businesses - were imposed through emergency regulations, which are not subject to parliamentary oversight and are limited to three months.
HE_067	13	With the expiration of some of the emergency regulations approaching, it was decided to draw up a memorandum of law that would authorize the government to act in the event of another outbreak.
HE_067	14	Officials from the relevant government ministries participated in the process, including the Ministry of Health, the Prime Minister&#39;s Office and the Department of Counseling and Legislation at the Ministry of Justice.
HE_067	15	The Ministry of Health officials believed that the law should give the government a very general authorization for actions that will be necessary to deal with the crisis, similar to the government&#39;s authority to establish emergency regulations.
HE_067	16	In the end, a wording was drawn up that authorizes the government to impose restrictions in predetermined areas, in accordance with the restrictions already imposed in recent months: in the private space, in the public space, restrictions on holding events, on public transportation, in educational institutions, workplaces, as well as the authority to impose a closure on a certain area.
HE_067	17	The memorandum states that in order to impose restrictions the government will have to declare a state of emergency that will be limited to 45 days, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, and that the Knesset will be able to cancel the declaration.
HE_067	18	In addition, it was determined that each limitation would be placed on the table of a committee of the Knesset, which could cancel it - but it could only do so retrospectively, and the limitations would not need the approval of the Knesset to enter into force.
HE_067	19	The memorandum of the law attracted a lot of public criticism - both for the fact that only a few days were given to receive public comments, most of them during Shavuot and the weekend, and for the powers that the law gives to the government.
HE_067	20	Thus, one of the sections that received the most criticism is the government&#39;s authorization to determine that violating the restrictions will be a criminal offense, and the authorization of police officers to enter residences without a warrant to monitor compliance with the guidelines.
HE_067	21	This is an authority that is given to police officers in normal times only in the face of suspicion of committing a serious crime, and it was included in the memorandum to allow the police officers to monitor, among other things, the duty of isolation.
HE_076	1	Report: &quot;Israeli software was used to spy on Al Jazeera journalists&quot;
HE_076	2	The spy software of the Israeli NSO was used to track dozens of journalists on the Al Jazeera network and the London-based Al Araby channel.
HE_076	3	This is what a new report by the Citizen Love Research Institute of the University of Toronto reveals.
HE_076	4	According to the institute&#39;s researchers, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are behind the hacks.
HE_076	5	The investigation also revealed evidence that NSO found a way to inject its spy, Pegasus, into iPhones without the need for active user action but by exploiting weaknesses in Apple&#39;s cloud infrastructure.
HE_076	6	Exploitation of a loophole with a similar principle in WhatsApp previously led to a lawsuit by Facebook against the Israeli company.
HE_076	7	According to the report, NSO&#39;s Pegasus software was used to attack 36 journalists, producers, presenters and executives at Al Jazeera, the Qatari news channel considered the most popular in the Arab world.
HE_076	8	We also monitored a female journalist on the Al Arabi channel, who also has ties to Qatar.
HE_076	9	The attacks took place last July and August, and were made possible by exploiting a weakness in Apple&#39;s systems called Kismet that allows the spy to be implanted without any action on the part of the user.
HE_076	10	This is in contrast to the known method of introducing Pegasus, which requires the user to click on an infected link in order to infect his device with a spy.
HE_076	11	The investigation began in January 2020 following an appeal to Citizen Love by Tamir Elmisal, a reporter and presenter at Al Jazeera, who previously reported on sensitive issues such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
HE_076	12	The journalist feared his phone had been hacked, and with the guidance of Citizen Love investigators, installed a VPN app that allowed them to monitor his internet traffic.
HE_076	13	Initially, the researchers did not detect any signs that Pegasus was working on the device.
HE_076	14	&quot;But on July 19, we saw that his device was suddenly communicating with a server we had previously identified as a Pegasus installation server.
HE_076	15	This is the first step in the installation of the surveillance system,&quot; Dr. Bill Marzak, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley and senior research fellow at Citizen Love, who led the writing of the report, along with John Scott-Railton, Nora Eljizawi, Sienna, told &quot;Calcalist&quot; Anastis and Ron Deibert.
HE_076	16	&quot;We didn&#39;t see evidence that he clicked on a link, but we did see that there was an unusual communication pattern with Apple&#39;s iCloud servers before.&quot;
HE_076	17	In the 3,000 hours that the investigators monitored the journalist&#39;s phone, they identified 30 different requests from his iPhone to the iCloud servers, probably as part of a routine backup of the device.
HE_076	18	However, in the 54 minutes preceding the request to the Pegasus installation server, 228 such requests were identified. 16 seconds after the last connection with the iCloud server, the first request to the Pegasus server was detected.
HE_076	19	&quot;It turned out that the attack was carried out using a component related to the FaceTime and iMessage applications,&quot; the report said.
HE_076	20	The weakness exploited by Pegasus in Apple systems is basically similar to the weakness exploited by the spy in the WhatsApp application, which was exposed at the beginning of 2019 - but more sophisticated.
HE_076	21	&quot;In the case of WhatsApp, the breach was made through an incoming call.
HE_076	22	In this case, none of the attackers saw an incoming call or message alert on the screen,&quot; Mrzak said.
HE_076	23	Citizen Love researchers worked with Al Jazeera&#39;s IT department and examined the network&#39;s traffic records.
HE_076	24	&quot;We identified 36 Al Jazeera personal phones hacked by four clusters of servers, attributable to four NSO operators,&quot; the report said.
HE_076	25	One operator, who spied on 15 phones, was identified by the investigators as acting on behalf of the United Arab Emirates government, and is the same person who previously spied on the journalist Ahmed Mansour from the United Arab Emirates.
HE_076	26	Another operator, who spied on 18 journalists, was identified as working on behalf of the Saudi government.
HE_076	27	NSO said: &quot;The report is based on incorrect and biased speculation and lacks any factual basis.
HE_076	28	We have not received the report and therefore cannot comment.
HE_076	29	Although NSO is a leader in its field in the world, not every event is necessarily related to us.
HE_076	30	We develop products that enable state security authorities to deal with terrorism and crime, but do not operate the technology and are not exposed to the information in the client&#39;s possession.
HE_076	31	When we receive information about improper use of our systems, we open an investigation in accordance with the compliance policy we have undertaken.&quot;
HE_082	1	Watch: the objects that are the most dangerous for corona infection
HE_082	2	The Ministry of Health invests great efforts in the quarantine with the aim of reducing the risk of infection from person to person, but this is really not enough: more and more evidence proves that the deadly virus survives on surfaces for days, and can continue to infect, simply - because we do not disinfect them.
HE_082	3	Reviews in the medical literature have shown that the corona virus survives for a long time on surfaces.
HE_082	4	One of the latest reviews showed that the virus can be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel.
HE_082	5	Similar results were obtained from tests done on the corona virus that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003.
HE_082	6	cellular.
HE_082	7	Our cell phones can accumulate large amounts of viruses.
HE_082	8	We take them everywhere, by hand, including on the street, and place them on all kinds of surfaces - outside and at home.
HE_082	9	And everything is caught in them.
HE_082	10	Therefore, the device must be disinfected from time to time.
HE_082	11	Several times?
HE_082	12	Depends on the conduct.
HE_082	13	If you stay at home and have your cell phone with you, once a day is enough.
HE_082	14	If you walked around places where there are other people, put it in different places, or touched it with your hand after contact with other surfaces and did not disinfect your hands, then you should wipe it from time to time.
HE_082	15	As for the method of disinfection, remove the cover from the cell phone, disinfect the phone itself on both sides and the protective cover.
HE_082	16	and repeat the disinfection from time to time.
HE_082	17	Handles and handrails.
HE_082	18	Many studies in the past have already shown that door handles are one of the most polluted surfaces in the environment.
HE_082	19	The Israeli Ministry of Health also warned that gloves may increase the risk of contracting the corona virus.
HE_082	20	And it&#39;s not just bathroom handles, but any possible door, even static ones that shouldn&#39;t be moved down to open the door.
HE_082	21	To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended to open the door with a handkerchief or tissue.
HE_082	22	If you don&#39;t have one, open the handle with your elbow.
HE_082	23	The same goes for an escalator railing or something else - try not to touch, and if you do touch, wash your hands afterwards.
HE_082	24	Buttons, switches, remote control and ATM.
HE_082	25	You won&#39;t believe how many hands passed over elevator buttons, power and lighting switches, intercom code buttons and other entry codes may contain huge amounts of bacteria, as well as the corona virus.
HE_082	26	Here too, it is better to use a tissue for pressing.
HE_082	27	If this is not possible, disinfect your hands after contact, and of course - do not touch any area of ​​the face.
HE_082	28	Fuel pumps.
HE_082	29	Refueling the car is usually done quickly, with other cars waiting until you vacate the station.
HE_082	30	That is why it is difficult to think intuitively about the contact with the refueling handle.
HE_082	31	But it has also passed through many hands before you, and may infect you or pass the virus on.
HE_082	32	Here too, it is better to squeeze between the palm and the handle with a tissue, or to disinfect the hands after refueling.
HE_082	33	keyboard and mouse.
HE_082	34	If your office computer is not used only by you, or you freeze on shift, you are at high risk of infection.
HE_082	35	Like other surfaces, the keyboards and the mouse also contain many contaminants, and could potentially contain the corona virus as well.
HE_082	36	Before starting work, pass an antiseptic wipe, and before starting work disinfect your hands as well.
HE_083	1	&quot;The working world we knew will no longer be the same&quot;
HE_083	2	After the corona exposed them to the possibility of working from home, and the demon turned out to be not so terrible, Yonatan Serosi estimates that quite a few companies will adopt this model in the future as well, after the crisis has passed.
HE_083	3	How will it work, what will be the effect on the relations between the employees and how will the outputs be measured?
HE_083	4	&quot;The future is already here&quot; says Yonatan Serosi, entrepreneur, expert in the field of the future world of work, and CEO of the development center of the Dropbox company in Israel, whose employees in Israel and around the world have worked diligently throughout the crisis and continue to do so even today.
HE_083	5	&quot;Because of the Corona crisis, the working world we knew will no longer be the same.
HE_083	6	The predictions published in the world in recent years regarding the &#39;future of work&#39; are coming true much faster than expected, mainly due to the fact that suddenly many organizations, reluctantly, were exposed to the possibility of working from home and saw that the demon is not terrible and that it is definitely possible.
HE_083	7	Working from home entails many advantages along with challenges, in regards to aspects of interpersonal relationships, measuring outputs and more.
HE_083	8	However, it is absolutely clear that there will be organizations that will decide to include this form of work in full or in part, even after the crisis, after having deeply understood its meanings.
HE_083	9	In addition, it is important to recognize that working from home is more than just a different physical work environment for employees, but can actually encourage focused output in which cooperation is maintained in teams, therefore we expect to see distributed work that continues fully or partially in many organizations beyond the crisis.
HE_083	10	At the same time, it&#39;s important to do it right and consider all professional and personal aspects.&quot;
HE_083	11	What will be the change in the relationship between the employee and the employer and between the employees among themselves?
HE_083	12	&quot;The most significant change lies in the ability of the employer to raise his level of trust in the employees.
HE_083	13	This, because they do not see each other physically.
HE_083	14	In addition, the focus should be on the outputs and not on the inputs.
HE_083	15	The employer must be concerned with the productivity of the employees and not the number of hours or how they actually performed the work.
HE_083	16	Regarding the difference in the relationship between the employees among themselves, it is clear that if they asked each other for help in the office, working from home creates physical and mental distance and there is a fear of disturbing each other.
HE_083	17	This may make it difficult to synchronize the consultation and work processes, but on the other hand it allows concentration and personal productivity increases.
HE_083	18	How will the outputs, objectives and inputs be measured and what tools will help with this?
HE_083	19	&quot;The new situation forces the managers to define together with the employee what is expected of him and for how long.
HE_083	20	The new situation requires the manager&#39;s trust in the employee that they will be able to carry out the task according to the schedules that suit them&quot; says Serosi.
HE_083	21	&quot;If you haven&#39;t done so already, it is necessary to plan in advance the goals and the schedules and thus the progress of the project can be monitored through communication methods and regular collaborations to offer transparency in the work being carried out.
HE_083	22	The process must be anchored in an orderly work plan, using tracking tools, tables, joint work tools that enable the sharing of information between the work groups, and more.&quot;
HE_083	23	Yonatan Serosi.
HE_083	24	How do you overcome the fact that there is no personal interaction like in the office?
HE_083	25	&quot;It is important to allow the work teams the ability to work independently in determining their schedules, depending on the personal situation of each of them, for example whether there are small children at home, so it is easier to work in the evening hours.
HE_083	26	In addition, it is important to add team &quot;meetings&quot; and virtual Happy Hour, to also maintain social cohesion.
HE_083	27	The key is to trust the team members and the team as a whole and make the necessary changes in order to succeed in meeting the tasks.&quot;
HE_083	28	What will working from home allow for those who live geographically far from the center - will the new situation allow overcoming all kinds of obstacles that existed in the past in finding a job due to geographical distance?
HE_083	29	&quot;This issue has long-term significance.
HE_083	30	We have now learned that it is also possible to hire talents who live far away from the offices, which makes it possible to recruit according to skills - the right person for the job, and not just the person who can be there physically between 9:00 and 17:00.
HE_083	31	Now, we understand that this is possible even though in the past this was not the strategy of many organizations.
HE_083	32	At the same time, you need to understand what this means and check how to make it work correctly when part of the team will work from the office and part from home.
HE_083	33	This is so that remote workers don&#39;t feel like outsiders.&quot;
HE_083	34	How do you overcome the disadvantages of working from home?
HE_083	35	&quot;There is no doubt that technology today has something to offer organizations in order to overcome the new way of working.
HE_083	36	Precisely for this purpose, today there are technologies, including Dropbox&#39;s technology for example, that allow teams to work together, without physically sitting in the same office and feeling as if they are in one common virtual work area in a common and unified smart work environment.
HE_083	37	The new work tools allow working in groups, even when everyone is in a different place and even works at different hours.
HE_083	38	Today there are even smart &#39;desks&#39; that allow employees to function optimally even in the &#39;noise&#39; of information around them, and to be able to prioritize and focus on what is right to do at that moment.
HE_083	39	And in addition, cut through the clutter of information noise by flooding the right information at the right time, so they can prioritize and focus on the important things.
HE_083	40	To these solutions are of course added tools that we have all come to know such as Zoom, video calls and more.&quot;
HE_084	1	Ahead of the holiday: the activity in the corona testing complexes has been reduced, hundreds of lines
HE_084	2	.
HE_084	3	The complexes throughout the country operated this morning only until 12:00 and will return to activity only after the holiday.
HE_084	4	Due to the early closure - many may remain in isolation until activity resumes in the complexes.
HE_084	5	Even at this stage, no abnormal loads are visible, hundreds are asking to be tested: &quot;to enter prayers with a green note&quot;
HE_084	6	The anti-corona testing complexes scattered throughout the country opened this morning (Wednesday) with limited software, and closed at 12:00.
HE_084	7	This, in preparation for Yom Kippur.
HE_084	8	This means that many of the citizens will be required to remain in isolation until activity resumes in the compounds.
HE_084	9	So far, hundreds have been observed in the complexes, but the Sheba Target sampling system stated that no abnormal loads are evident.
HE_084	10	The testing complex at the Sami Ofer Stadium in Haifa seems to have no queues, as does the complex in Ashdod that seems sparsely populated.
HE_084	11	However, in Petach Tikva and Rishon Lezion, slight congestion was reported in the vaccination complexes.
HE_084	12	In Jerusalem, this morning Natan Shalu, a 38-year-old resident of Nachalot, arrived at the rapid inspection station at the MDA station in the Romema neighborhood.
HE_084	13	&quot;Yes, a green note, not a green note, I want to go to the synagogue tonight with a whole heart and know that I am not putting the elderly worshipers at risk.
HE_084	14	In our synagogue, there was iron discipline on Rosh Hashanah in the matter of corona tests, and I hope this will happen on Yom Kippur as well.&quot;
HE_084	15	Uriah, 21, came to be tested after being asked to be tested, like the other worshipers at the Hesder yeshiva where he studies at Yosh. Again, and I believe that Yom Kippur will pass in peace&quot; in the settlement of Jessar al-Zarqa, where the complex opened at 08:00, there was a permanent line of about 120 people.
HE_084	16	However, the queue moves forward efficiently.
HE_084	17	Village resident Anis Jorban, a 17-year-old 12th grade student, is one of the many volunteers here and he helps residents who have difficulty filling out the online form.
HE_084	18	&quot;This is important so that as many people as possible are tested and thanks to this the village remains healthy,&quot; he said.
HE_084	19	Quite a few residents also come from the Jewish communities in the area where no inspections are held today.
HE_084	20	&quot;We came with the children because of the school in the village, which was shut down a week ago because of a teacher who was sick with Corona, since then they have been at home until they pass two tests,&quot; says Salim Amash, the 35-year-old village resident bus driver who came with his niece Hanuna and son Hamdan.
HE_084	21	A decrease in the number of patients is difficult.
HE_084	22	The Ministry of Health data published this morning indicate a decrease in the number of seriously ill and ventilated patients, but an increase in the infection rate which stands at 1.06 while the percentage of positive tests remains stable.
HE_084	23	As of yesterday, 9,539 new verified cases were discovered, out of 165,584 tested.
HE_084	24	Currently there are 650 patients whose condition is defined as severe, of which 172 are on ventilators.
HE_084	25	Since the outbreak of the epidemic, 7,444 corona patients have died in Israel. 163,143 students are in isolation, of which 44,112 are verified. 3,709 isolated teaching staff work, of which 2,309 are verified.
HE_084	26	More than 5.5 million people have been vaccinated with a second dose, and about 3 million have already received the third vaccine.
HE_095	1	Mayor of Beer Sheva: The Negev will become our nightmare, the police need to be reinvented
HE_095	2	Rubik Danilovich, the mayor of Beer Sheva, harshly criticized politicians and law enforcement officials this morning (Tuesday).
HE_095	3	Danilovich said these things during the presentation of an outline for turning the Negev into a sought-after housing area, and about a week after the attack that took place in the city of V, in which four people were killed.
HE_095	4	&quot;In 2050 there will not be a Jewish majority in the Negev,&quot; he warned.
HE_095	5	&quot;Today we are only two thirds.
HE_095	6	The country creates two weak states in the north and south without a Jewish majority and with a low socio-economic status.
HE_095	7	And leave only Jerusalem and Gush Dan.&quot;
HE_095	8	At the beginning of his remarks, he mentioned the serious attack in the city alongside the one that happened in Hadera at the beginning of the week.
HE_095	9	&quot;Since the Guardian of the Walls, the reality in the State of Israel has changed,&quot; he warned.
HE_095	10	&quot;Personal security has been undermined alongside terrorist and crime incidents.
HE_095	11	I have dedicated the last few months to a deep discourse in the political, political and security sphere.
HE_095	12	You saw me shouting in the media, but it&#39;s time to take action, I don&#39;t usually talk myself into it, there is a new reality that has changed.
HE_095	13	I am not here to blame anyone, neither right nor left, nor one government or another.
HE_095	14	Something bad is happening to the State of Israel.&quot;
HE_095	15	&quot;The State of Israel is captive to a wrong concept,&quot; he continued.
HE_095	16	&quot;There are those who think that the threats are thousands of miles away here.
HE_095	17	But no, the threat is internal.&quot;
HE_095	18	After that he pointed an accusing finger: &quot;We must restore the regimes and fight civil terrorism, and of course turn the Negev into a housing solution in Israel and it is in the Negev.&quot;
HE_095	19	The police are battered, they are not able to deal with crime and terrorism, there are good people there but they can&#39;t.
HE_095	20	The police need to be reinvented.
HE_095	21	The police have become a negative brand.&quot;
HE_095	22	Danilovich clarified that the main reason for the deep crisis in the Negev is the lack of a strategic plan - which leads to a campaign of accusations between the various parties.
HE_095	23	&quot;This is a wake-up call, we must start acting.
HE_095	24	There are two possibilities: either the Negev will become the new Zionist dream or it will become our nightmare.
HE_095	25	There are gaps in employment and health.
HE_095	26	There will be a civil Mary here.
HE_095	27	I maintain statehood, but there will be a generation here after us who will no longer behave this way.&quot;
HE_095	28	Dinlovich devoted a large part of his speech to the Bedouin population in the Negev and their situation.
HE_095	29	This, after it became clear that the perpetrator of the attack in his city is a Bedouin resident of Hora, a former teacher who expressed identification with the ISIS organization.
HE_095	30	&quot;There is a population in the Negev whose mother is from Gaza and Hebron and they cast their terror, they are not the majority,&quot; he said.
HE_095	31	&quot;There are two populations - one - the Bedouin population that wants to integrate and live here.
HE_095	32	The second - does not recognize the country and is an existential threat.
HE_095	33	This is a terrorist population.&quot;
HE_095	34	&quot;There are almost 50% student dropouts in Bedouin society,&quot; he continued.
HE_095	35	&quot;It&#39;s bad for the country.
HE_095	36	Who checks what is done?
HE_095	37	Who supervises them?
HE_095	38	Then we wonder that there is a generation that is disconnected. You need to invest more. 50% are unemployed there and still have luxury cars.
HE_095	39	We must not be self-righteous and must tell the truth.
HE_095	40	It&#39;s all a result of indecision.
HE_095	41	When everyone stutters - the extremists take over.
HE_095	42	The Shin Bet must get involved in what is happening in the Negev.&quot;
HE_097	1	Tens of thousands of patients a day did not close the schools.
HE_097	2	Kanievsky&#39;s funeral Yes, the Ministries of Education and the Interior easily approved the closing of hundreds of educational institutions across the country due to the rabbi&#39;s funeral.
HE_097	3	The police and the government could have taken many measures to reduce harm to parents and students, but chose the easy way
HE_097	4	For the past six months, the government has refused to move the schools to distance learning even for one day.
HE_097	5	Classes in kindergartens and schools continued as usual, even though hundreds of thousands of students were infected in the classrooms, and tens of thousands of teachers could not come to teach due to illness or isolation.
HE_097	6	The message of the Minister of Education, Yifat Shasha-Biton, was &quot;the easiest thing was to close the education system&quot;, and therefore the schools were instructed to remain open no matter what - even when there were no teachers in them and no classes were held in them, and even at the height of the epidemic, while students arrived without tests Corona.
HE_097	7	This message remains valid despite an epidemic that threatens to collapse the hospitals.
HE_097	8	However, last night (Saturday), it became clear how easy it is to shut down the studies in the education system throughout Gush Dan and the central settlements - because of Rabbi Kanievsky&#39;s planned funeral journey.
HE_097	9	The Ministry of Education hastened to inform the local authorities about the transition to distance learning, since in any case the teaching staff cannot get to the schools because of the blocking of the roads.
HE_097	10	As of last night, more than 500 schools and kindergartens have already reported switching to distance learning, and hundreds more of having a partial school day.
HE_097	11	In addition, for the first time since the first wave of the Corona virus, the Ministry of Education approved the closing of the special education institutions, which have remained open since May 2020.
HE_097	12	The ministry even approved stopping the transportation system for students in special education.
HE_097	13	Ayalon Road, Albukar.
HE_097	14	It turned out that the roads to some of the settlements in the center were actually not blocked - so it was possible to hold studies
HE_097	15	The funeral procession held in Bnei Brak led to the closing of educational institutions not only within the city, but also in Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan and Givatayim, and also in settlements further away, such as Kfar Saba, Hod Hasharon, Ra&#39;anana, and Kadima-Zoran.
HE_097	16	Even schools that continued to operate received permission to cancel trips and tests.
HE_097	17	But in the morning, it became clear that the roads to Tel Aviv and some of the settlements in the center were actually not blocked - so it was possible to hold classes in hundreds of kindergartens and schools, and reduce the harm to students and parents.
HE_097	18	It seems that the Ministry of Education and the local authorities looked for and found a reason to cancel the studies.
HE_097	19	It seems that the decision to close the education system in Gush Dan and the surrounding area was made too easily, without appreciating the enormous damage to the students and their parents, and especially to the special education students.
HE_097	20	It was possible, for example, to postpone the closing of the roads by an hour, to allow the teaching staff to reach the kindergartens and schools, since in any case the funeral was postponed to 12.
HE_097	21	Another option was to compensate teachers who would have been stuck in the central area after graduation due to the continuation of the blockades, or to give a few hundred of them special permission to come to teach, thus preventing the closure of at least some of the institutions.
HE_097	22	Alternatively, it would be possible to organize convoys of buses from Jerusalem and the ultra-orthodox settlements in the center of Bnei Brak, in order to reduce congestion and roadblocks.
HE_097	23	In general, it seems that it was easier for the government ministries and the police to call on hundreds of thousands of students and parents not to come to the educational institutions, workplaces and medical treatments in Gush Dan, than to try and reduce the consequences of the road blocks.
HE_097	24	By the end of the day, all the students of the center will learn not only who Rabbi Kanievsky was and how important he was to the ultra-orthodox public, but also how easy it is to close their schools.
HE_102	1	What are the chances of getting cancer - and what are the chances of recovering from it?
HE_102	2	A cancer diagnosis was until a few years ago a death sentence, but the field of medicine is developing, and for many types of cancer there are already effective treatments, and even tools that help prevent the disease.
HE_102	3	On the occasion of Cancer Day, which is celebrated today (Friday), we invited Prof. Ido Wolf, director of the oncology department at the Ichilov Hospital, to the &quot;Expert Clinic&quot; studio, to ask what we must know about cancer today - and what the future holds for us.
HE_102	4	&quot;Oncology is considered a very tough field, many are not even able to say the words oncology or cancer, the newspaper always says &#39;severe diseases&#39; or &#39;complex conditions&#39;,&quot; said Prof. Wolff, &quot;but in the end, cancer is another disease, in my opinion Not even the most difficult, there are more difficult things.
HE_102	5	I&#39;m not sure that terrible dementia is easier than cancer.&quot;
HE_102	6	According to him, the most important thing to know about cancer is that &quot;in recent years there has been a big change in the field of cancer treatment.
HE_102	7	If it used to be a death sentence, if we look at Israel&#39;s statistics, the chance of getting cancer is decreasing, and the chance of recovery is increasing.
HE_102	8	So the news is good.&quot;
HE_102	9	Prof. Wolff also had an encouraging answer to the question about the price that cancer patients pay during complex treatments such as chemotherapy.
HE_102	10	&quot;First of all, if we detect it early we will need less treatments,&quot; he explained, &quot;and if we do need treatments - even here there are already big changes than there used to be.&quot;
HE_102	11	True, there is still chemotherapy, especially in breast cancer, where this is what causes hair loss and more side effects, but in other cancers we have been able to give much less harsh combinations, and in some cases we switch from chemotherapy treatments to all kinds of biological and immune treatments that are much easier for the patients, so in a sense we have successes&quot;.
HE_102	12	Even in the more difficult cases, Prof. Wolf emphasizes, it is usually a very tough war of several months, &quot;but we do this war to reach 120 later.
HE_102	13	The advantage of today&#39;s treatments is that the vast majority of patients - we can cure them, and 120 is a realistic forecast, to recover from cancer.
HE_102	14	So it&#39;s true, there will be some difficult months along the way, even very difficult, but the optimistic side is that if I have a 35 or 40-year-old patient with breast cancer, who in the past I would have known she would die of this cancer, today I know that after a few difficult months she will be able to live and have The family and the children, and even the grandchildren,&quot; he said.
HE_102	15	One of the problems with cancer, especially the metastatic and simple one, is that it is sometimes difficult to find or locate it, but also in this field there has been significant progress in recent years.
HE_102	16	&quot;Today there are already blood tests that are developing in this direction, that can detect really tiny elements of the tumor in the blood, super super sensitive tests, that can detect even if there is a minimal disease,&quot; said Prof. Wolff, &quot;It is currently in research, and I can assure you in 3- In 5 years we will use these tests routinely, and we will be able to know who has or does not have the small things and adjust treatment better.
HE_102	17	And more than that, I assume that in 3-5 years we will test healthy people, and already with a blood test we will be able to detect the cancer.&quot;
HE_102	18	More about cancer in Vala! Health: today we are not there yet, there are only regular screening tests that can be done to detect early cancer, &quot;but in a few years, which is not long, each of us will go to the doctor and have a blood test done and look for the cancer at an early stage,&quot; explained Prof. Wolff .
HE_102	19	He added that in England they have just started a study on exactly this test, they plan to test several hundreds of thousands of people, &quot;so a study that is actually being carried out today will produce results in two, three, four years, and it is likely that in not many years each of us will go to the doctor once every few years &quot;Give me a blood test and tell me if I have cancer.&quot;
HE_102	20	He added that &quot;the test already exists, it is in hand, I think that in 10 years our conversation will be completely different.
HE_102	21	When there is cancer, most people look for a cause, but it is not always possible to find it.
HE_102	22	&quot;When someone has cancer, they try to find the cause, it&#39;s natural, and many times the cause of cancer is attributed to all kinds of events that have happened to us, of all kinds and species.&quot;
HE_102	23	However, according to Prof. Wolff, about 5 percent of cancer cases are the result of genetics and heredity, 30-35 percent are mutations caused by the environment, such as smoking and sun exposure, and about 60 percent are other factors that have no clear cause.
HE_102	24	&quot;When something happens randomly, the other name is bad luck, and in fact we get a large group of people who say, &#39;But I behaved well, why did this happen?&#39;
HE_102	25	And the real answer is that many of the processes are biological processes that behave according to a mathematical model, and they don&#39;t exactly care what we did or didn&#39;t do,&quot; explained Prof. Wolf, &quot;you have to understand that.&quot;
HE_102	26	This understanding, of course, should not harm optimism, since as Prof. Wolf made clear the chance of getting cancer decreases, and the chance of recovery increases, but it is important to be able to deal with this diagnosis, which, despite the optimism, is still scary.
HE_106	1	How much will the purchase tax on an apartment cost you this year?
HE_106	2	Every person who purchases a right to real estate in Israel is required to pay purchase tax.
HE_106	3	This is actually a tax that that person pays to the state for carrying out the transaction.
HE_106	4	In some cases, you can get an exemption from paying the tax.
HE_106	5	At the beginning of each year, the tax authority updates the tax rates for the current year and is doing so now as well.
HE_106	6	How will this affect you?
HE_106	7	You&#39;ll see right away.
HE_106	8	For more details about attorney Carmit Shafivar we said that the purchase tax is paid to the state for every real estate transaction.
HE_106	9	The purchase tax is calculated according to the value of the transaction at rates that are updated once a year.
HE_106	10	There are different tax rates regarding a residential apartment defined as a single apartment, additional apartments beyond this apartment and rights in real estate that are not intended for residential use such as commerce and agriculture.
HE_106	11	The calculation of the purchase tax rates is done, among other things, in accordance with the consumer price index for the past year.
HE_106	12	The practical meaning of updating the height of the stairs in case of an index increase is a reduction in the amount of the purchase tax.
HE_106	13	In other words, the price from which purchase tax liability starts has gone up. According to the CBS data, this year there was a 5.3% increase in the consumer price index.
HE_106	14	With the beginning of the year 2023, the tax authority is expected to change the tax rates for this year, and it seems that the increase in the price index is expected to benefit the apartment buyers.
HE_106	15	The increase in the Tenant-Owned Housing Services Index raises the threshold for exemption from purchase tax for the purchase of a single apartment.
HE_106	16	This means that buyers will pay less tax.
HE_106	17	The tax rates for 2023, when purchasing a single apartment, state that no tax will be paid on the portion of the value up to NIS 1,919,294.
HE_106	18	That is, up to this amount, an exemption from payment of purchase tax will be granted.
HE_106	19	Last year, the year 2022, the tax brackets determined that no tax would be paid up to the amount of NIS 1,805,545.
HE_106	20	It was also updated that on the part of the value that exceeds NIS 1,919,294 and up to NIS 2,276,526 - a tax of 3.5% will be paid.
HE_106	21	In 2022, this tax was paid on the part of the value exceeding NIS 1,805,545 and up to NIS 2,141,605.
HE_106	22	On the part of the value exceeding 2,276,526 NIS and up to 5,873,149 NIS - a tax of 5% will be paid.
HE_106	23	In 2022, the amount at this level was NIS 2,141,605 and up to NIS 5,525,070.
HE_106	24	This year it was determined that on the part of the value exceeding NIS 5,873,149 and up to NIS 19,577,165 - an 8% tax will be paid.
HE_106	25	In 2022, the amount at this level was NIS 5,525,070 and up to NIS 18,416,900.
HE_106	26	In addition, on the part of the value exceeding NIS 19,577,165 - a tax of 10% will be paid, in contrast to the year 2022 where the amount was NIS 18,416,900.
HE_106	27	This means that this is good news for the apartment buyers.
HE_106	28	This year they will be able to purchase a more expensive apartment and enjoy an exemption or a lower purchase tax.

HE_114	1	The incoming head of the Mossad: Iran is working to realize the nuclear vision under the cover of international protection
HE_114	2	The head of the new Mossad, David Barnea, said today (Tuesday) that &quot;Iran is working, even at this very moment, to realize its nuclear vision, under the cover of international protection.
HE_114	3	Under the auspices of the agreement and without it, with lies and concealments, Iran is in constant progress towards a program to produce weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
HE_114	4	Barnea added at his inauguration ceremony that &quot;our security challenges are very big, and at the top of the list is Iran.&quot;
HE_114	5	Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu spoke at the Mossad head exchange ceremony, with the appointment of Barnea as Yossi Cohen&#39;s replacement, and claimed that the Iranian nuclear project is an existential threat, the &quot;greatest&quot; for the State of Israel.
HE_114	6	&quot;Whether to threaten us directly with the destruction of a small and concentrated country with nuclear weapons, or whether to threaten us with tens of thousands of missiles or thousands of missiles backed by a nuclear umbrella.
HE_114	7	It is a threat that threatens the continuation of the Zionist enterprise, and we must fight this threat endlessly,&quot; he emphasized.
HE_114	8	He congratulated the intelligence agency for its fight against the issue, and made it clear that Israel will continue to fight this as long as necessary.
HE_114	9	&quot;You are doing it, we talked yesterday about actions that were taken and these actions must continue.
HE_114	10	I said these things to my friend of 40 years, Joe Biden, and I told him: &#39;With or without an agreement, we will continue to do everything in our power to thwart Iran&#39;s arming itself with nuclear weapons.&#39;
HE_114	11	Because Iran is different from the other countries that have nuclear weapons today.
HE_114	12	That&#39;s why marriage is not an option.&quot;
HE_114	13	Finally, Netanyahu clarified that Israel will not hesitate to confront the White House on the issue.
HE_114	14	&quot;If we have to choose, I hope it won&#39;t happen, between friction with our great friend the United States and the elimination of the existential threat - the elimination of the existential threat is increasing,&quot; Netanyahu said.
HE_114	15	&quot;This falls first of all on you, on the political leadership of the State of Israel, and on you Dadi - you have to do everything, but everything, to ensure that under no circumstances will Iran arm itself with nuclear weapons.&quot;
HE_114	16	Defense Minister Benny Gantz responded to Netanyahu&#39;s words, and even though he expressed agreement with regards to the seriousness of the threat from Tehran, he claimed that he had achieved that dialogue with Washington on the issue should be conducted &quot;in closed rooms&quot;.
HE_114	17	&quot;Iran is a threat to regional stability and world peace.
HE_114	18	It is a country that creates terrorism and promotes a nuclear program that is dangerous for the State of Israel, and yet, Israel is the most powerful country in the region within a radius of 1,500 km from Jerusalem,&quot; Gantz said.
HE_114	19	&quot;The United States has been and will continue to be Israel&#39;s most important ally in maintaining its security and its security superiority in the region.
HE_114	20	The Biden administration is a true friend of Israel, Israel does not and will never have a better partner than the United States.
HE_114	21	Even if there are disputes, they will be resolved through direct dialogue in the closed rooms and not through defiant dialogue that may harm Israel&#39;s security.
HE_114	22	David Barnea spoke at his inauguration ceremony and said that &quot;our security challenges are very big, and at the top of the list is Iran.&quot;
HE_114	23	He added that under the auspices of the nuclear agreement &quot;and even without it, with lies and concealments, Iran is in constant progress towards a program to produce weapons of mass destruction&quot;

HE_114	37	&quot;This falls first of all on you, on the political leadership of the State of Israel, and on you Dadi - you have to do everything, but everything, to ensure that under no circumstances will Iran arm itself with nuclear weapons.&quot;

HE_114	39	Defense Minister Benny Gantz responded to Netanyahu&#39;s words, and even though he expressed agreement with regards to the seriousness of the threat from Tehran, he claimed that he had achieved that dialogue with Washington on the issue should be conducted &quot;in closed rooms&quot;.
HE_114	40	&quot;Iran is a threat to regional stability and world peace.
HE_114	41	It is a country that creates terrorism and promotes a nuclear program that is dangerous for the State of Israel, and yet, Israel is the most powerful country in the region within a radius of 1,500 km from Jerusalem,&quot; Gantz said.
HE_114	42	&quot;The United States has been and will continue to be Israel&#39;s most important ally in maintaining its security and its security superiority in the region.
HE_114	43	The Biden administration is a true friend of Israel, Israel does not and will never have a better partner than the United States.
HE_114	44	Even if there are disputes, they will be resolved through direct dialogue in closed rooms and not through defiant dialogue that may harm Israel&#39;s security.&quot;
HE_115	1	Netanyahu attacked the law limiting the priesthood: &quot;Gideon, take down the Vasach&quot;; Saar: &quot;He lives in the movie&quot;
HE_115	2	The chairman of the opposition MK Benjamin Netanyahu (Likud) today (Monday) at the meeting of the Likud faction attacked the bill to limit the term of the prime minister that was approved by the ministerial committee for legislation, and the bill that prevents a person accused of crimes from forming the government.
HE_115	3	Netanyahu called the proposals &quot;Iranian and Syrian laws&quot;, and accused the coalition leaders of violating the will of the public.
HE_115	4	The Minister of Justice responded to the comments by saying that Netanyahu &quot;lives in a movie&quot;.
HE_115	5	&quot;They are trying to pass an Iranian law that should actually lead to a situation where those who can win the elections will not win the elections,&quot; Netanyahu accused, &quot;but there is a problem with passing an Iranian law because what endangers them is that the will of the public will be expressed.
HE_115	6	This law is too blatant so they start with a preliminary law - a term limit law that does not exist in any parliamentary democracy.
HE_115	7	In a democracy, the public decides who will lead it, not an arbitrary law that will transfer power to officials or politicians.&quot;
HE_115	8	&quot;It won&#39;t help them.
HE_115	9	The public cannot be stopped.
HE_115	10	We will win, we will take all these laws and throw them in the trash, and we will return the will of the people to the people,&quot; Netanyahu continued.
HE_115	11	Justice Minister Gideon Sa&#39;ar responded to the remarks at the beginning of a new Hope faction yeshiva, and welcomed the approval of the law by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation.
HE_115	12	&quot;I am happy that all the government partners came together yesterday to make an important amendment to term limits,&quot; said Sa&#39;ar.
HE_115	13	&quot;I heard the nonsense of the chairman of the opposition who said that this does not exist in any parliamentary democracy.
HE_115	14	Netanyahu sent me messengers just a few months ago to form a government and suggested that I enact a term limit law and even agreed to enact it retroactively so that he would only have a few years left to serve.
HE_115	15	Apparently a few months ago it was democratic and now it has suddenly become undemocratic.
HE_115	16	Netanyahu is living in a movie, I don&#39;t know if in an Iranian movie or a Syrian movie.
HE_115	17	There is a huge majority of Israelis who support this law.
HE_115	18	We will pass this law and Netanyahu will not be able to cancel it.&quot;
HE_115	19	The alternate prime minister and foreign minister, Yair Lapid, also addressed the issue at the opening of the Yesh Atid faction yeshiva.
HE_115	20	&quot;We promised and kept it,&quot; said Lapid about promoting the law.
HE_115	21	&quot;Yesh Atid has been fighting for this law since the day it was established.
HE_115	22	For this we established a government.
HE_115	23	To do all the things we promised to the citizens of Israel.&quot;
HE_115	24	&quot;This is not the end of the process, there is another way to do it, but if you want to change the country - this is the way.
HE_115	25	Form a government, pass a budget, then go and start keeping the promises one by one.
HE_115	26	We are passing this law together with the Minister of Justice, Gideon Sa&#39;ar, who led a smart and precise move.
HE_115	27	Working together, in close dialogue.
HE_115	28	Just as we passed the budget with Minister Lieberman, and we will pass the equalization of the burden with Minister Gantz.
HE_115	29	There is also an advantage in the complex structure of this government.
HE_115	30	He forces us to talk.
HE_115	31	to cooperate with people who are different from us.
HE_115	32	This is what the Israeli center has always said: let&#39;s focus on our common goals, not on what separates and divides,&quot; said Lapid.
HE_116	1	The outcry of the residents of the south against crime: &quot;We feel powerless and greatly afraid&quot;
HE_116	2	Hundreds of people will demonstrate this evening (Wednesday) in Be&#39;er Sheva against the crime in the Negev, under the title &quot;The Negev is bleeding: the citizens&#39; protest&quot;, and will call for the restoration of security to the region.
HE_116	3	Eti, whose husband was injured during a robbery at a business in the city about a week ago: &quot;We must wake up the public, go up to give a speech at a demonstration shouting: &quot;A man works and they come and rob him, how can this continue?
HE_116	4	We feel powerless and have great fear.&quot;
HE_116	5	&quot;There is increasing violence,&quot; Etti adds, &quot;this is reflected in the harassment of girls, physical violence, crime, no one, everyone in Be&#39;er Sheva is tired of this situation, everyone is frustrated.
HE_116	6	There are great suspicions among the residents here, it&#39;s a loss of control, it happens everywhere.&quot;
HE_116	7	Yohai Peretz, a member of the committee to save the Negev, explains what the residents hope to achieve with the protest: &quot;We are protesting to provoke the government and the local authorities to allocate budgets for the security of the residents.
HE_116	8	We demand a change in the punishments.&quot;
HE_116	9	We are tired of being harassed, we are tired of burglaries, and we are tired of no police officers on the streets of Beer Sheva and the Negev at all - it is important not to include the Bedouin sector in these phenomena,&quot; Peretz emphasizes, &quot;This demonstration is also for the Bedouin residents of the Negev who suffer from the same criminal gangs.
HE_116	10	We fight for them too.&quot;
HE_116	11	Rad Abu Elkien, a social activist in the Negev, actually opposes the demonstration: &quot;We also demand security, but we don&#39;t need demonstrations and mobilization of extremist organizations.
HE_116	12	In the Negev we have a common goal to live in coexistence, it will be and will continue to be, it is forbidden to divide between the sectors, and it is forbidden to incite against the Bedouin population, together we will manage to overcome the situation.
HE_116	13	Together we can make the long-awaited change.&quot;
HE_116	14	The protesters will gather outside the district court in Beer Sheva around 18:00, and from there they will march to the city hall.
HE_116	15	Among the organizations that will participate in the demonstration will be the committee to save the Negev, My Israel, if you want, and Ragivim.
HE_116	16	The demonstration comes against the background of the publication of the data on the rampant crime in the southern district, according to which almost a quarter of the violent crimes in the country occur in the south, and last year more investigations were opened in the district than in any other district.
HE_116	17	Among the latest crime incidents, on Saturday, the police arrested a 15-year-old boy in the Hora settlement, who was in possession of a Glock type pistol and two cartridges with bullets.
HE_116	18	This, after the police were called to the settlement when they received reports of hearing gunshots, and policemen who caught the boy on the spot searched him.
HE_116	19	On Friday night, masked unknown persons fired from short range at a Berhat business for a long time without interruption, as part of a conflict between families, which broke out after a large fight involving about 20 people.
HE_116	20	The police arrested a 30-year-old resident of Rahat on suspicion of the act.
HE_116	21	In the documentation published on social networks, two men wearing masks are seen outside the car, pulling out weapons and opening fire for about half a minute.
HE_116	22	In the nearby street, people were seen hanging out at the restaurant when they were frightened and when screams were heard in the background.
HE_116	23	In the meantime, last Tuesday, 600 South District police officers embarked on a huge operation to eradicate crime, using drones, helicopters, dogs and horsemen, and conducted raids throughout the Negev, during which they seized weapons, drugs and a lot of cash.
HE_116	24	Nachshon Nagler, commander of the Negev region who took office a few months ago, stated: &quot;You cannot argue with the feelings of the citizens.
HE_116	25	There was a breach of security in Beer Sheva, my job is to restore security to Beer Sheva and the Negev.
HE_116	26	This is my mission.&quot;
HE_120	1	&quot;Like a military operation&quot;: The Knesset convenes to discuss the first state budget in 3 years
HE_120	2	The Knesset plenum will today (Tuesday) discuss the state budget for 2021-2022 towards its final approval, and the coalition is preparing for one of the fateful moments for it.
HE_120	3	If there is no dramatic change, the Knesset will approve the Budget Law and the Arrangements Law at the end of this coming week, after three years since they were last approved.
HE_120	4	In doing so, the coalition will provide itself with political stability for the coming months.
HE_120	5	The discussions opened in the plenary at 9:00 with a speech by the Chairman of the Finance Committee, MK Alex Kushnir, as well as with speeches by the chairmen of the committees that promoted the reforms in the settlement laws.
HE_120	6	The discussions will last about 33 hours, during which the opposition members from the Likud, the ultra-Orthodox factions and the joint list who are expected to oppose the budget will speak, according to a pre-arranged schedule.
HE_120	7	On Wednesday at 18:30 the debate will end with speeches by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
HE_120	8	Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman said at the opening of the discussions: &quot;We have been waiting for this moment for three and a half years.
HE_120	9	I especially want to thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Alex Kushiner.
HE_120	10	We pass a budget exactly on the day of the Balfour Declaration, the second of November.&quot;
HE_120	11	The Chairman of the Interior Committee, MK Walid Taha (RAM), said in the discussion that &quot;this is the first time that the Arab society is reflected in such a big way in the budget book.&quot;
HE_120	12	After their speeches, the 120 MKs will begin voting on the thousands of reservations and laws for long hours, until Friday at the latest.
HE_120	13	For some of them this is the first time they will try to approve a budget, and in the coalition they prepared for it in advance &quot;like a military operation&quot;, as they say.
HE_120	14	The chairman of the coalition, MK Idit Silman, and her deputy, MK Boaz Toporovski, sat and tried to analyze &quot;problematic scenarios&quot; and find immediate solutions for them.
HE_120	15	&quot;This is the first budget for many members of the Knesset and in general we run a complex coalition,&quot; explained Toporovski, &quot;therefore it was necessary to prepare for every scenario.&quot;
HE_120	16	The two prepared for scenarios in which one of the MKs would decide to rebel and vote against the budget, or an MK would be found sick with Corona, as well as the possibility that due to the protracted votes, a reservation from the opposition would be accepted, and the plenum would have to stop the discussions, return to legislative amendments in the committees and bring the law to a repeat vote in the plenum .
HE_120	17	In order to avoid this, the members of the Knesset of the coalition were instructed to enter the plenum in comfortable clothes, without tablets or laptops and to eat light food beforehand so that they would not fall asleep during the votes that would continue into the night.
HE_120	18	Silman and Toporovsky recruited &quot;line commanders&quot; - a MK who would be responsible for the row in which he sits in the plenum, and even asked the MKs to postpone the flu vaccination that was given this week in the Knesset in order to avoid a situation of &quot;side effects&quot; after the vaccination that would cause them to be absent.
HE_120	19	The coalition is trying to maintain cautious optimism, and in recent days Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman held talks with most of the Knesset members in order to identify problems in advance.
HE_120	20	&quot;I don&#39;t foresee any breakdowns on the way,&quot; he said yesterday at the faction meeting.
HE_120	21	&quot;There is broad agreement in the Knesset, the coalition is very cohesive.
HE_120	22	There shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;
HE_120	23	He added: &quot;I am really excited and for me this is a very important day, also for the State of Israel and the economy.&quot;
HE_120	24	The great ultra-Orthodox rabbis, Rabbi Haim Kanievsky and Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, published a public letter against the current government which they called the &quot;government of malice&quot; whose goal is to &quot;hurt the owner of the pillars of the world&quot;.
HE_120	25	The two rabbis, who mainly represent the Lithuanian ultra-orthodox stream, wrote that the members of the government &quot;conspired against the Torah scholars in any way&quot;, and mentioned, among other things, the decree of day dormitories, one-time taxation, the kosher reform and the outline of the reformist Western Wall.
HE_120	26	According to them, the goal of the government ministers and the representatives of the coalition is to &quot;interfere with the Kollel elders in helping their young children, to impose various taxes to make it difficult for Torah students, to harm the kosher food for all the people living in Zion, and also to recognize classes that are foreign to the Masora Judaism and to displace the rule of Halacha, while blaspheming The holy place is a remnant of our temple.&quot;
HE_120	27	The rabbis state in their letter: &quot;Certainly their plot will not succeed&quot; and &quot;these attempts will only add to and strengthen the learners&quot;.
HE_120	28	In response, Rabbis Kanievsky and Edelstein call on the public to &quot;make Kiddush Hashem, strengthen the Torah, virtues and faith.&quot;
HE_123	1	Europe is burning: London is hotter than the Sahara desert
HE_123	2	Authorities across southern Europe are struggling to control huge fires in Spain, Greece, France and Portugal, and the death toll from the extreme heat continues to rise.
HE_123	3	In Spain, helicopters rained water on the flames at temperatures higher than 40 degrees Celsius in a mountainous area that makes extinguishing efforts difficult.
HE_123	4	Stunned residents watched the high flames and thick smoke over the Jereta Valley.
HE_123	5	&quot;Climate change affects everyone,&quot; said Miguel Angel Tamio.
HE_123	6	More than a thousand people have died so far due to the ongoing heat wave in Portugal and Spain.
HE_123	7	The temperature in areas of Spain reached 45.7 degrees Celsius.
HE_123	8	The Spanish weather agency has issued heat warnings across the country, including in the north.
HE_123	9	According to the agency, the heat wave may end today (Monday), but temperatures will still remain &quot;extremely high&quot;.
HE_123	10	In Portugal, about a thousand firefighters are trying to save 13 forest fires in the center and north.
HE_123	11	The Ministry of Health announced that in the last week 659 people died due to the heat wave, most of them adults.
HE_123	12	In Greece, 71 fires broke out in 24 hours on Saturday.
HE_123	13	Fires raged in several areas in central Spain and in the north.
HE_123	14	William and Alan McCurdy from Britain fled to a local sports center after being forced to flee their home on Saturday due to the fires.
HE_123	15	&quot;It was very quick...at first we didn&#39;t think it was serious.
HE_123	16	I thought the fire was under control and I was surprised to see that it was approaching us,&quot; 68-year-old William told Reuters.
HE_123	17	In France, fires spread over an area of ​​100,000 dunams in the southwest of the country, and more than 14,000 people were evacuated from their homes. 1,200 firefighters are battling the blazes, authorities said.
HE_123	18	France issued a red alert, the highest, and called on residents to &quot;be alert&quot;.
HE_123	19	In Italy, smaller fires have been raging for the past few days and the forecast is that degrees will remain above 40 in some areas for the next few days as well.
HE_123	20	In Britain, temperatures are expected to reach 41 degrees Celsius - an all-time high.
HE_123	21	The British National Weather Service issued a red warning of &quot;extreme heat&quot; for the first time in history.
HE_123	22	London today is expected to be one of the hottest places in the world - more than Western Sahara, Jamaica in the Caribbean, Malaga in Spain and Athens in Greece.
HE_123	23	The hot weather is expected to last until tomorrow before cooling off on Wednesday.
HE_123	24	The meaning of the red alert is that there will be &quot;a widespread impact on people and infrastructure, with significant changes in workplaces and daily routines&quot;.
HE_123	25	Some of the schools will be closed today or end the school day earlier than usual.
HE_123	26	Network Rail has warned that people should only travel if &quot;it&#39;s absolutely necessary&quot;, and some line cancellations have already been announced, as well as restrictions on train speeds.
HE_123	27	Alongside the Bureau of Meteorology&#39;s red warning, the British Ministry of Health issued a level four warning, which means &quot;state of emergency&quot;.
HE_123	28	Health Minister Steve Barclay said that ambulance services will be expanded, and emergency centers will be strengthened.
HE_123	29	The London Ambulance Service said it had recorded 7,000 calls a day since the heatwave began - compared to an average of 5,500 a day.
HE_123	30	Beaches across the country were busy over the weekend.
HE_123	31	Water companies in the south and east of England reported a spike in demand that led to low pressure and disruptions in water supply.
HE_123	32	Experts urge people to drink plenty of water and draw the curtains so that sunlight does not enter.
HE_123	33	&quot;In this country we treat a heat wave as a situation where you can play in the sun,&quot; said Penny Undersby, director general of the Bureau of Meteorology.
HE_123	34	&quot;This is not the weather we are talking about today.&quot;
HE_123	35	Chester Zoo is closed to visitors during the heatwave.
HE_125	1	Weapons instead of drugs: drug smuggling is expanding, criminals are motivated by money but also by nationalism
HE_125	2	The wave of illegal drug smuggling into Israel from Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt does not stop and only gets worse, in the absence of a hermetic border, and in view of the vacuum created by the lack of military personnel along the borders, the police recognize the strategic threat and invest effort to thwart the smuggling with the help of the IDF.
HE_125	3	Although they manage to register significant achievements, this does not deter the Israeli and foreign smugglers from continuing their criminal activities and smuggling drugs and deadly weapons to perpetrators of crime and terrorist elements in Israel, among other things, due to the large financial profit they scoop into their pockets.
HE_125	4	The assessment among security officials is that today in Israel there are tens of thousands of illegal weapons that are strengthened by perpetrators of crime, in Arab society in particular, that have been stockpiled over the years for the purpose of deterrence until actual use that ends in injury and death.
HE_125	5	The characteristics of the smuggling that has been thwarted in the last three years are usually a larger amount of weapons and ammunition and less drugs such as cocaine and marijuana, and this is due to the huge profit inherent in selling them in Israel.
HE_125	6	For example, the 4th and 5th generation Glock pistols, among the most advanced on the market, whose cost is estimated at $2,000, are priced in the Israeli market at about NIS 45,000.
HE_125	7	An M-16, whose cost is estimated at several thousand dollars, is sold on the Israeli market for 90-110 thousand shekels, and a Kalashnikov rifle for 60 thousand shekels.
HE_125	8	On the other hand, the demand for the Carlo rifle is decreasing due to the operational need of criminals for a reliable and accurate weapon.
HE_125	9	In the northern district of the police, and with emphasis on the central unit under the command of the head of the Yamar, Meni Binyamin, together with the district YGAL unit, they are well aware of the smuggling phenomenon for many years and have been dealing with it even before it spread to other districts.
HE_125	10	For example, until Operation Northern Shield in 2018, in which terrorist tunnels of the terrorist organization Hezbollah into Israel were thwarted, the organization tried to maintain calm in the sector and no large-scale smuggling of ammunition was carried out.
HE_125	11	However, after the operation, there was a dramatic increase in the number of illegal arms smuggling under the auspices of Hezbollah, both in the quantities and the high quality of the weapons.
HE_125	12	At the same time, the perforated Israel-Jordan border line is more preferred for illegal drug smugglers.
HE_125	13	In the past, most of the weapons were diverted to the territories, and accordingly, those who led the smuggling operations from the Israeli side were Palestinians living in the territories, who sold a certain part of the weapons to perpetrators of crime in the Arab society in Israel.
HE_125	14	But today most of the weapons and ammunition go directly to Israeli Arab criminals, and thus the relationship between the parties has tightened to a level where Israeli Arabs, from the Triangle in the north to the Bedouin diaspora in the south, defeat the smuggling operations and manage the ammunition trade without any fear.
HE_125	15	The types of goods smuggled at the borders in the district sector change dramatically all the time, from drugs to weapons, and thus, in recent years, the smugglers at the Lebanese border changed phase, and began to prioritize the smuggling of illegal drugs over cocaine and drugs of various types, not only for economic reasons but also for nationalistic reasons.
HE_125	16	This is the case, for example, in the case of smuggling amlach that was caught while guarding the Walls, including 180 grenades, intended for the &quot;Brothers in the Galilee&quot;, that is, for Israeli Arab citizens in the north against police and security forces during the riots at the Walls.
HE_125	17	Another case, the attack in which Eliyahu Kay was murdered by the terrorist Fadi Abu Shahid in Jerusalem, was carried out using standard weapons that were estimated to have been smuggled from Jordan.
HE_125	18	The attack that happened at the beginning of the week in the Bekaa against the soldiers&#39; bus was also carried out according to estimates using weapons smuggled from the Jordanian border.
HE_125	19	On the Syrian border, on the other hand, the weapons smuggling mainly contains Soviet weapons such as Kalashnikovs, while the weapons smuggling on the Jordanian border originating from Iraq mostly contains Western or American weapons.
HE_125	20	The Jordan-Israel border borders the length of Israel from north to south, and is an interface point between the northern and southern police districts.
HE_125	21	Since the arrival of the Negev Region Sub-Commissioner Nachshon Nagler, and under the command of Commander Peretz Amr to his position, emphasis has been given to offensive activity against the perpetrators of crime and arms smuggling, this in the face of the increase in the scope of the phenomenon.
HE_125	22	Since the beginning of 2022, about 12 illegal drug smuggling have been thwarted in the South District, a significant increase from previous years, with five smuggling being thwarted in 2021 and three in 2020.
HE_125	23	On the Israel-Egypt border, on the other hand, drugs are mainly smuggled, from cannabis of all kinds to cocaine and heroin, which make their way from Ethiopia through Cairo to the Israel-Egypt border, straight to the Israeli drug dealers who are not content with smuggling through flights and mail.
HE_125	24	Some of the drug smuggling moves in the opposite way, from Israel to Egypt.
HE_125	25	These are mainly high-quality cloned cannabis seeds that are smuggled into Israel from Europe, mainly from the Netherlands and Belgium, thanks to the good relations between the Israeli and European merchants.
HE_125	26	From there they make their way to Sinai, where they grow in the fields of Bedouins, who bring back the harvest later on.
HE_125	27	Drug smuggling at the Egyptian border is in the hundreds every year, but is decreasing as a result of police activity with the help of the IDF.
HE_127	1	&quot;If bank employees get an exemption from fees - it&#39;s not bad if we reduce them for everyone&quot;
HE_127	2	The Knesset&#39;s Economic Committee approved for first reading the bill that would limit to NIS 360 the commission that a bank may charge for opening a mortgage file.
HE_127	3	The bill is supported in principle by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice.
HE_127	4	These only object to setting the amount of the ceiling in legislation, and prefer to entrust the flexibility in setting it to the regulator (the Bank of Israel).
HE_127	5	The current price list allows banks to charge a portfolio opening fee of 0.25% of the loan amount.
HE_127	6	It turns out that the fee for opening a case currently ranges between NIS 820 and 5,800, depending on the amount of the mortgage.
HE_127	7	Apparently, regardless of the bank&#39;s operational costs - which every commission is required to cover.
HE_127	8	&quot;In 2021, the public took out 130,000 mortgages totaling 116 billion shekels, which allowed the banks to collect a commission of 0.25% - and collect 290 million shekels.
HE_127	9	The banks need to make a profit, but they take more because they can, while the public is held captive.
HE_127	10	It&#39;s pigs for its own sake,&quot; MK Haim Katz (Likud), who initiated the bill with MK Eti Atia, said at the hearing.
HE_127	11	&quot;Not everyone pays the commission,&quot; added Katz.
HE_127	12	&quot;There are strong people who get a discount, and there are weak people who don&#39;t get it, because no one counts them.&quot;
HE_127	13	Bank of Israel data show that the percentage of discount recipients increased in the last two years from 61% to 73%.
HE_127	14	Most of them received discounts of 60%-80%, and about 15% received a full 100% discount.
HE_127	15	However, even last year, 27% of mortgage borrowers did not receive a commission discount at all.
HE_127	16	MK Shlomo Karai (Likud), asked the representative of the Bank of Israel if the regulator knew the identity of the recipients of the full exemption.
HE_127	17	When she answered in the negative, he said: &quot;Let me tell you.
HE_127	18	These are mainly the tens of thousands of bank employees and their families, who enjoy a full exemption - and if these tens of thousands receive a 100% discount, the banks can probably manage even without such a high commission.&quot;
HE_127	19	According to Karai, the Bank of Israel&#39;s data regarding the rate of discount recipients is distorted, because sometimes the banks condition the acceptance of the discount on the customer&#39;s consent to additional services (for example, opening a bank account).
HE_127	20	Karai also pointed out that collecting the commission as a percentage of the loan amount is a distortion that is repeated even when collecting a bank guarantee fee that is backed by a deposit.
HE_127	21	&quot;The bank doesn&#39;t have a job there.
HE_127	22	He simply freezes my money, which is lying with him - and charges me a kind of interest, because instead of paying a fixed fee - I pay an annual percentage on the deposit.&quot;
HE_127	23	The Bank of Israel prefers to postpone the legislation after the reform of the mortgage market is completed (this August).
HE_127	24	The institution claims that the fee for opening a case is accepted in the world, and that the maximum rates in Israel are lower than those used in the world.
HE_127	25	However, those in favor of the law claim that there is no reason to charge a fee as a percentage of the loan - since this is intended to cover fixed overheads.
HE_127	26	&quot;If the yield on 30-year government bonds is negative - the banks make enough money on mortgage interest, and there is no reason for a mortgage handling fee to be derived as a percentage of the amount of the loan,&quot; Katz added.
HE_128	1	In the background of the attempt to promote normalization with Israel: Biden&#39;s senior advisers secretly arrived in Saudi Arabia
HE_128	2	Two of the senior advisers of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, made a secret visit to Saudi Arabia for talks on the mediation between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which was revealed in Walla! this week
HE_128	3	Other topics that will come up for discussion are the American demand for increased oil production as well as the preparations for Biden&#39;s planned visit to the Kingdom at the end of June - according to three American sources.
HE_128	4	President Biden plans to visit Saudi Arabia as part of his visit to the Middle East which will also include Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
HE_128	5	In order for the visit to take place, the parties need to finish formulating a package of understandings on these issues between the US and Saudi Arabia.
HE_128	6	According to three American sources, President Biden&#39;s senior adviser on the Middle East issue, Brett McGurk, and the American energy envoy Amos Hochstein, who is considered very close to Biden, arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to hold meetings with Saudi officials.
HE_128	7	At the White House they refused to comment.
HE_128	8	The US State Department said: &quot;We have nothing to disclose about travel at this stage.&quot;
HE_128	9	On Monday night it was published in Walla! Because the Biden administration is secretly mediating between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in an attempt to achieve a series that will complete the transfer of the islands of Tiran and Fin in the Red Sea to Saudi sovereignty, and that will include a separate course of Saudi normalization measures towards Israel.
HE_128	10	If the negotiation ends successfully, it may pave the way for significant normalization steps on the part of Saudi Arabia towards Israel.
HE_128	11	Such a development would be a significant breakthrough and a major political achievement for the Bennet-Lapid government and the Biden administration in the Middle East.
HE_128	12	The White House wants to reach an understanding on the issue before Biden&#39;s planned trip to the Middle East at the end of June.
HE_128	13	The Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, was asked about the publication in Walla!
HE_128	14	during a panel at a conference in Davos on Tuesday.
HE_128	15	He did not deny the existence of the negotiations.
HE_128	16	&quot;We have always said that normalization is the end result of a path that needs to be taken,&quot; said the Saudi Foreign Minister.
HE_128	17	&quot;Normalization between the region and Israel will be beneficial, but we will not be able to reap all these fruits if we do not address the Palestinian issue.
HE_128	18	The fact that this issue is not resolved creates instability in the region.
HE_128	19	The first priority should be to achieve progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and if this happens it will benefit the entire region.&quot;
HE_128	20	President Yitzhak Herzog said during a panel at the Davos conference that Saudi Arabia is an important country and Israel would like the Saudis to join the Abraham Accords.
HE_128	21	&quot;It&#39;s a process and it takes time,&quot; Herzog said.
HE_128	22	Biden wants the Saudis to increase oil production.
HE_128	23	So far, despite several requests, the Saudis refuse and claim that the oil market is balanced and there is no need to inject more oil into the market.
HE_128	24	The reason why Biden needs the Saudis to increase oil production is to try to lower the price of fuel in the world and especially in the US, in preparation for the mid-term congressional elections in November.
HE_128	25	Increasing oil production is also important to Biden against the background of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions he wants to impose on Russian oil.
HE_128	26	Without additional Saudi oil on the market, Biden will find it difficult to advance such sanctions.
HE_128	27	The Saudis have emphasized so far that they will not violate an agreement they signed with Russia on setting oil production quotas, but this agreement is about to expire in September.
HE_128	28	This may pave the way for a Saudi-American agreement to be implemented in the future, but announcing it will bring down prices and help the American president.
HE_128	29	If the talks of Biden&#39;s advisers in Saudi Arabia on oil, normalization with Israel and other issues are concluded successfully, this will increase the trust between the US and the Saudis and pave the way for Biden&#39;s visit.
HE_128	30	In such a visit, the American president is expected to meet in one way or another with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
HE_128	31	American intelligence determined that bin Salman ordered the murder of Washington Post commentator Jamal Khashoggi.
HE_128	32	Against this background, Biden called Saudi Arabia during his campaign for the presidency a &quot;rebellious country&quot; and promised to take a tough line towards it.
HE_128	33	A visit by Biden to Saudi Arabia may symbolize a significant change in this American policy.
HE_160	1	Precedent PSAD: A controlling owner can purchase the shares of the public company under his control at the market price only
HE_160	2	When a controlling owner purchases the shares of the public company under his control, two major problems arise: the conflict of interest and the price.
HE_160	3	This week, the judge of the Central District Court, Benny Arnon, dismissed a derivative suit against the controlling owner and officers of the Optibase real estate company.
HE_160	4	Arnon, in a comprehensive 130-page ruling, ruled in favor of the company regarding three private allocations it made to its controlling owner, Shlomo Weiler, in 2008, 2011 and 2013.
HE_160	5	According to the plaintiffs, the shareholders Simcha and Baruria Shiloni, the allocations were made with a conflict of interest of the controlling owner who was on both sides of the transaction, and at prices lower than the fair and proper value of the stock on each of these dates.
HE_160	6	The price question is the central message in the story.
HE_160	7	In situations where the controlling owner wishes to purchase its shares in order to disappear from the stock market and turn a public company into a private one, strict conditions have been imposed on the board, due to the fear of improper manipulation.
HE_160	8	For example, if the controlling owner knows about an imminent exit and therefore has an interest in keeping the public away from the expected profits.
HE_160	9	Therefore, in the case of &#39;going private&#39; (turning a company from public to private), the controlling owner is obliged to make a &quot;full tender offer&quot; and the price will be determined according to the DCF method - future cash flow - which embodies the future valuation of the company.
HE_160	10	Arnon stated in the current case that in the absence of suspicion of manipulation, the price will be the market value of the share only.
HE_160	11	This, after he was convinced of the legitimacy of the reasons for the allocation - the company&#39;s need for cash, by way of selling shares to the controlling owner who pours money into it in exchange for shares.
HE_160	12	&quot;Different from a full tender offer,&quot; Arnon wrote, &quot;a private share allocation makes it possible to examine the stock&#39;s behavior in the market after the shares are allocated, and accordingly to identify whether the allocation was made at a price that does not reflect the fair value of the share, including due to the use of insider information or due to the choice of timing manipulative to make the allocation by the controlling owner&quot;.
HE_160	13	That is, if the controlling owner Weiler will later profit from the shares he purchased in the allotment, the rest of the stockholders will also profit as well.
HE_160	14	So it&#39;s debatable whether Weiler acted to save the company or took advantage of a business opportunity.
HE_160	15	But, even if he survives, all shareholders will benefit - unlike in the case where the company was delisted.
HE_160	16	The plaintiffs claimed that the company did not examine alternative ways of raising funds, such as loans for example or issuing shares to the public.
HE_160	17	In this matter, the judge ruled in favor of the company, when he applied the &#39;business judgment&#39; rule.
HE_160	18	In dealing with the claim of conflict of interest raised by the plaintiffs, Arnon stated that the decision passed the triple approval required for transactions involving interested parties - the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the general meeting, with a large majority of untainted shareholders.
HE_160	19	So the judge applied the essentially procedural rule, which immunizes the officers from lawsuits if they acted in good faith, in the absence of a conflict of interest and in an informed manner, that is, they reviewed and considered the deal.
HE_160	20	The plaintiffs argued that the stricter test should be applied because it is a transaction in which the controlling owner stands on both sides.
HE_160	21	This is the &quot;rule of complete fairness&quot; test, which was applied by Judge Dania Keret Meir in the Makhteshim Agan deal.
HE_160	22	A rule that checks the fairness of the transaction itself, and not just its procedural cleanliness, as required by the &quot;business judgment rule&quot; test.
HE_160	23	Arnon rejected the demand to apply the strict rule.
HE_160	24	In his opinion, it should be applied &quot;only when the transaction shows suspicious signs such as a noticeable inequality between the controlling owner and the other shareholders&quot;.
HE_160	25	Arnon stated that &quot;the decision to raise capital for the company was a reasonable and logical decision under the circumstances.&quot;
HE_160	26	The bottom line, summarizes attorney Sharon Lubetzky Hess of Amit Polk Matlon, who represented some of the officers, is that &quot;in the absence of fear of manipulation of the share price, a public company can make a private allocation to its controlling owner at the market price, without being required to carry out a valuation of its shares .
HE_160	27	In this way, the verdict contributes to creating certainty, which did not exist until now, regarding the proper pricing of the company&#39;s shares for the purpose of carrying out a private allocation, which as a rule is a faster and cheaper option for raising capital for the company, certainly in relation to the issue of shares to the public, which requires the publication of a prospectus and additional costs on the side.
HE_160	28	The controlling owners of the company, Shlomo Weiler and the Capri family, were represented by attorney Shai Tsadik from the office of Fisher Bacher Chen Wall Orion &amp; Co.; the directors, members of the audit committee and the officers of the company were represented by attorneys Sharon Lubetzky Hess and Shahar Haron from the office of Amit Polk Matlon &amp; Co.; The company was represented by attorney Michael Ginzburg and Matan Winkler from Gross Kleinhandler Hodak HaLevi Greenberg &amp; Co.
HE_160	29	The plaintiffs were represented by attorney Shay Ganor from the office of A.S.
HE_160	30	Shimron, Malcho Perski and Co.
HE_172	1	Bar Siman Tov moves into business: in talks with Discount Capital to establish a fund in the health sector
HE_172	2	Barsi&#39;s new career?
HE_172	3	The former CEO of the Ministry of Health, Moshe Bar Siman Tov, has recently been in talks with Discount Capital, the investment arm of Discount Bank, to establish a joint investment platform in the field of health technology.
HE_172	4	This was learned by Calcalist.
HE_172	5	The relationship between Bar Siman Tov and Discount is handled by Hila Himi-Alpert, CEO of Discount Capital.
HE_172	6	The talks have been going on for several weeks, but no decision has yet been made on the matter.
HE_172	7	The goal of both parties is to choose companies for investment in which it will be possible to introduce real strategic value in breaking into international markets.
HE_172	8	Officially Bar Siman Tov cannot yet be a partner in such a venture due to the cooling off period he is in as is customary after retiring from a senior position in the civil service.
HE_172	9	The cooling off period is expected to end in May 2021, but this January he will be able to conduct official talks.
HE_172	10	One of the options being considered is to establish an investment fund as is customary in the field.
HE_172	11	Sources in Bar Siman Tov&#39;s environment said that naturally he is exploring various professional options, including establishing an investment platform in the health sector.
HE_172	12	The field of health investments has been booming in recent years and is gaining momentum following the establishment of many startups that develop technology in the fields of medical devices, digital medicine and artificial intelligence.
HE_172	13	About two months ago, the retiring CEO received from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an offer to return to a senior position as part of the fight against Corona, but he turned it down.
HE_172	14	The proposal from Netanyahu came against the background of the murky relations that prevailed between the previous corona projector Prof. Roni Gamzo and Netanyahu, while Netanyahu&#39;s relations with Bar Siman Tov in the first wave were considered very good.
HE_172	15	Since he retired, Bar Siman Tov has continued to express his opinion about the Corona crisis.
HE_172	16	For example, last September he tweeted that &quot;Israel is at a critical point in time today and I feel that too many people think there is no real danger.
HE_172	17	And that is important to talk about.
HE_172	18	The main thing is a safe corona routine.
HE_172	19	This is what happens in countries that manage to keep morbidity low and here we are less good.
HE_172	20	We quickly and with great force brought back the studies and events.
HE_172	21	Today we understand that it was a mistake and are making amends.&quot;
HE_172	22	In an interview with Yedioth Ahronoth a few days ago, Bar Siman Tov said: &quot;There are signs that herald a third wave.
HE_172	23	You have to think about how to keep the morbidity at a controlled level as much as possible.
HE_172	24	The vector was and remains education.
HE_172	25	Students in all settings should study in capsules, and they should be separate from each other.
HE_172	26	Keeping a large capsule in the morning and mixing it in the afternoon is as if we did nothing.
HE_172	27	Is closure realistic?
HE_172	28	Definitely.
HE_172	29	There are significant factors for morbidity: studies and gatherings.
HE_172	30	This matter needs to be taken care of now.&quot;
HE_172	31	Bar Siman Tov recently joined the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) as a visiting researcher under the leadership of Colonel (Ret.) Amos Yadlin, where he is expected to lead the study of the place of the health system in Israel&#39;s national security concept, and to conduct studies and policy documents, in collaboration with senior researchers at INSS which will be presented within the framework of the institute and submitted to the public and the decision makers.
HE_172	32	Discount Capital is an anchor investor in several funds, including Fimi, Vertex, Comra and more.
HE_172	33	Discount Capital is also invested in Marius Nacht&#39;s Amoon health fund.
HE_172	34	This year, Discount Capital made several investments in companies in the food sector, in the satellite company Image (ISI) and in several technology companies.
HE_173	1	MK Toma-Sliaman: &quot;The support of the joint list is conditional on renouncing the deal of the century&quot;
HE_173	2	The Joint List faction will meet today (Sunday) at noon in Kfar Qassem, to discuss the question of whether to recommend Blue and White Chairman Benny Gantz to the President for the mandate to form the government, as well as to discuss what conditions the list will present in exchange for such a recommendation.
HE_173	3	It is estimated that if they reach an agreement on the issue, 12 MKs from the Hadash, Ra&#39;am and Tal parties are expected to support the recommendation, while three members of the Knesset from Balad will not support it.
HE_173	4	Later in the day, MK Aida Toma Sliaman was interviewed on behalf of the List on Aral Segal&#39;s program on 103FM, during which she stated that the List&#39;s support for granting the mandate to form the government to Gantz is conditional on canceling the deal of the century.
HE_173	5	&quot;If Gantz wants us, he should contact us officially after his attitude towards us in the elections.
HE_173	6	There will be no divide and rule, whoever wants us has to talk to all 15.
HE_173	7	Those who want us should give up the deal of the century, unilateral annexation and the nationality law.&quot;
HE_173	8	Yesterday Toma-Sleiman addressed the issue of support for the candidates for the government, in response to the statement that Gantz gave yesterday in the village of Maccabiah, and said that &quot;now it is clear, Gantz does not understand that he has no recommendation as long as he does not turn to the joint list directly and publicly.
HE_173	9	Gantz turn away.&quot;
HE_173	10	Ahead of the faction meeting, Balad chairman Matans Shahada said this morning that the joint list &quot;will not repeat the mistake of recommending Gantz&quot; in talks to form the government.
HE_173	11	The joint list will not recommend Gantz without clear commitments.
HE_173	12	We will not make decisions based on insinuations, we learned from last time.&quot;
HE_173	13	He also added that &quot;the Arab parties realized that they could demand, especially when no bloc has 61 mandates, and after, according to the reports, Netanyahu offered them benefits in exchange for not supporting Gantz.&quot;
HE_173	14	MK Shahada later presented his list of conditions for supporting &quot;Blue and White&quot; and said that among the requested conditions his party would demand the repeal of the Kaminitz Law and the Nationality Law as threshold conditions.
HE_173	15	He concluded his words by saying that &quot;all members of the list will make a decision together.&quot;
HE_173	16	His faction member, MK Sami Abu Shahada, said last night in response to statements made by Netanyahu and Gantz that &quot;Ganz knows what he must do to form a government.
HE_173	17	We prevented the instigator from Balfour from obtaining a majority in the Knesset, and we will continue to do everything to block his path to the prime minister&#39;s chair.
HE_173	18	The Arab public has put its faith in the joint venture, and we will work to advance its interests and fight for justice, equality, and peace.&quot;
HE_173	19	MK Mansor Abbas, chairman of the National Assembly, also referred to the possibility of supporting Blue and White today and said: &quot;We in the National Assembly sat down yesterday and said that at the moment there is no infrastructure to make a decision to support, recommend or not.
HE_173	20	There is nothing in our hands that can tell us to go for it.
HE_173	21	I don&#39;t rule out support outright, but there is currently no infrastructure for it.
HE_173	22	In contact with Blue and White, because of the insult to the honor of the Arabs.
HE_173	23	I cannot return to the Arab public and say that I have a mandate to recommend him.&quot;
HE_173	24	He later referred to his party&#39;s position and said that &quot;BLD has a clear position, it is against recommendation and any kind of participation in support in one way or another.
HE_173	25	It does not depend on blue and white.
HE_173	26	This is BLD&#39;s position.
HE_179	1	Getting started: the deluge of bills has already begun
HE_179	2	With a delay of two weeks, the 23rd Knesset started this week.
HE_179	3	Tomorrow (Wednesday) the Knesset committees will be established, and in a coalition they will start enacting the Norwegian law in favor of Blue and White.
HE_179	4	But the real sign of the start of activity in the Knesset were the many legal declarations that were released into the air.
HE_179	5	These are not bills that have even the slightest chance of passing through full legislation, but statements of law that are mainly intended for a headline in a newspaper.
HE_179	6	First it was MK Yulia Malinovski from &#39;Israel Beytinu&#39; who suggested that the president of the country could not be the one against whom an indictment was filed.
HE_179	7	The intention is clear: in Israel Beytinu refers to the interpretations according to which Netanyahu is facing the president&#39;s residence, and they, for their part, are trying to stop him, if only they had a majority.
HE_179	8	For now this is a statement of intent.
HE_179	9	They then did it &#39;to the right&#39; of their new seats in the opposition.
HE_179	10	This time they announced the submission of the &quot;French Law&quot; proposal.
HE_179	11	In this incarnation, Yamina is seeking to prevent the opening of an investigation against a sitting prime minister, but of course the law will no longer apply retroactively to Netanyahu.
HE_179	12	MK Shaked even said this morning (Tuesday) on the IDF airwaves that she would like to pass this law together with the allocation of the prime minister&#39;s term for two terms.
HE_179	13	This time too, the bill has no chance of progressing on the legislative level, but at least there is a title here and an opportunity to attack the Likud from the outside.
HE_179	14	Law declarations are a flourishing branch of the Israeli parliament.
HE_179	15	Members of the Knesset propose thousands of bills every year, but in practice - only a few will enter the hall of fame, that is, the law book of the State of Israel.
HE_179	16	This time it will be difficult for the opposition and even the coalition to promote legislation, because according to the Blue and White and Likud agreements, no legislation will be promoted in the next six months that is not related to Corona or the budget.
HE_179	17	The opposition will be required to reduce its tools, and its possibility to act will remain mainly through the committees in the coming months.
HE_179	18	In order to enable the start of the work of the Knesset, the coalition, led by MK Miki Zohar, reached agreements with the opposition.
HE_179	19	As part of the agreements, the committee for state audit, the committee for dealing with violence in the Arab sector, the committee for promoting the status of women, as well as another committee will be transferred to the opposition.
HE_179	20	At the same time, the Likud finished splitting up their committees: the aliyah committee will be in the hands of MK David Bitan and the gas handling committee will be handed over to MK Avi Dichter.
HE_179	21	The Labor and Welfare Committee will also be in the hands of the Likud and will be headed by MK Haim Katz, and the Corona Committee will be headed by MK Yifat Shasha Biton.
HE_179	22	The &#39;Blue and White&#39; committees will be the interior, education and child rights committees.
HE_179	23	The ultra-Orthodox will receive the economy, constitution, finance and public inquiries committees.
HE_179	24	Today (Tuesday) members of &#39;Yimina&#39; tried to reach agreements with Zohar and Knesset Speaker Yariv Levin and take over the State Audit Committee.
HE_179	25	According to practice, the committee is supposed to be in the hands of the opposition and &#39;Yimina&#39; proposed MK Ofir Sofer to run the committee with the support of the coalition, instead of Yesh Atid candidate Ofer Shelah.
HE_179	26	Zohar and Levin refused Yumina&#39;s proposal, in order to allow the continuation of work in agreement with the opposition as was customary in the past and especially for the busy day in the Knesset tomorrow (Wed).
HE_179	27	&#39;Yimina&#39; is expected to receive, together with &#39;Israel Beitenu&#39;, one committee in a half-term, out of the four committees of the opposition.
HE_184	1	The judge in the Netanyahu cases responded to a postponement request: &quot;At the moment there is no change in the dates&quot;
HE_184	2	The third hearing in the thousands of cases was held today (Sunday) at the Jerusalem District Court.
HE_184	3	It was a reminder discussion for an update regarding the status of the investigation materials and determining the continuation of the discussions.
HE_184	4	In his first appearance as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s defense attorney in Case 4000, Attorney Baez Ben Zur had an argument with the head of the panel of judges, Rivka Friedman-Feldman, and claimed that essential materials were not received in time.
HE_184	5	Towards the end of the hearing, to which the defendants themselves - Netanyahu, Shaul and Iris Elovich and Noni Mozes - were not required to appear - Attorney Ben Tzur asked to postpone the answer to the indictment that should be given on November 29 until a decision is made on the request concerning the investigation materials as well as the request to amend the indictment.
HE_184	6	Friedman-Feldman rejected the words: &quot;Currently there are fixed deadlines.
HE_184	7	As much as it is necessary to change...
HE_184	8	As of this moment, nothing changes.&quot;
HE_184	9	At the beginning of the hearing, the head of the panel referred to the request of Netanyahu&#39;s defense attorneys to hold the hearing on the requests to remove the privilege of the evidence materials before another judge.
HE_184	10	&quot;In every case where there is a petition to lift privilege, a hearing is held as one party, your request was to transfer the case to another judge, what is different?&quot;
HE_184	11	the judge asked, and it was agreed that the request would remain for the consideration of the court.
HE_184	12	Ben Tzur referred to Netanyahu&#39;s requests to remove the secrecy and claimed that the request &quot;focuses on the key witnesses, especially the state witnesses in the key operations.
HE_184	13	We are talking about a procedure that involves three cases, on the face of it it is a complex case, there are precedent issues, media relations and public figures, actions of speakers, it is understandable that there are quite a few lines of defense that should be deployed before the court, hence the complexity of the procedure.&quot;
HE_184	14	Ben Tzur brought as an example of materials that were missing for the defense a document containing a transcript of conversations between state witness Shlomo Filber and journalists, which was only handed over to the defense last Thursday.
HE_184	15	Of these, it seems that the one who was the CEO of the Ministry of Communications expresses doubt about the strength of the evidence.
HE_184	16	Filber said, according to the document: &quot;On Friday I got up and saw the headlines, I saw that they were trying to give artificial life to this nonsense of Elovitch and Netanyahu...
HE_184	17	They invented a bribe here, which is a scarecrow bribe...
HE_184	18	Noni&#39;s bribe is nice for their headlines.
HE_184	19	It is an apparent bribe.
HE_184	20	I don&#39;t know how to tell you.
HE_184	21	What we are seeing now is a supreme effort of a system that has been working for two years and has stretched itself to the limit...
HE_184	22	The police collect pieces of the puzzle, as many pieces as possible, and then decide how to play with the picture of the puzzle.
HE_184	23	If there&#39;s a part that doesn&#39;t fit, she removes it.&quot;
HE_184	24	Attorney Ben Zur wondered: &quot;The accuser said that we decided to classify the conversations as relevant, from the beginning we thought they were irrelevant.
HE_184	25	This is material that until two days ago we did not have at our disposal.&quot;
HE_184	26	Judge Friedman-Feldman: &quot;What do you mean by this, sir?
HE_184	27	We will not discuss what is not in front of us&quot;?
HE_184	28	Ben Tzur: &quot;It affects this given discussion...
HE_184	29	That is why we note the issue, and that they take into account the statements of the accuser that everything was handed over.
HE_184	30	What arrived on Thursday has weight.&quot;
HE_184	31	Friedman-Feldman: &quot;Sir, with all the general claims, I don&#39;t expect us to check all the materials.
HE_184	32	There is a presumption of normalcy in the conduct of the state, mistakes can happen, regarding the submitted documents we will check them.
HE_184	33	It is possible to move forward and address and respond specifically to the things requested of the state&#39;s claims.&quot;
HE_188	1	Claim: Juniors took care of the mother, the baby was born injured
HE_188	2	Parents of a child with cerebral palsy claim that negligence at birth caused the severe damage.
HE_188	3	According to them, the fetus suffered from disturbances in the oxygen supply but the caesarean section was delayed.
HE_188	4	A medical malpractice claim against general health services was recently submitted to the Central District Court by parents claiming medical malpractice at the birth at the Meir Hospital which caused the baby severe neurological damage.
HE_188	5	Through the Gutman-Amir law firm, the parents claim that in May 2016, the mother came to the hospital when she was 38 weeks pregnant, due to suspected water loss, bloody discharge and irregular contractions.
HE_188	6	Upon arrival, she reported that she could feel the fetal movements very well.
HE_188	7	According to them, after receiving her, the mother was not given a medical or obstetric examination, nor an ultrasound examination to assess the condition of the fetus.
HE_188	8	She was connected to a monitor that was pathological and characterized by repeated arrhythmias.
HE_188	9	The plaintiffs stated that this kind of pathological monitoring required an immediate evaluation by a senior physician and, following that, a decision for an urgent caesarean section.
HE_188	10	This, especially in view of the advanced week of delivery and the fact that the plaintiff was far from giving birth.
HE_188	11	Despite this, the attending physician was not called, no assessment of the condition of the fetus was performed, and no intrauterine resuscitation was performed.
HE_188	12	The prosecutors added that the first monitoring lasted 56 minutes (36 minutes more than necessary) and at the end the specialist who treated her, who was allowed to practice medicine only three months earlier, did not understand the pathological pattern and its severity.
HE_188	13	Later, the mother was connected to the monitor again and the result continued to indicate severe fetal distress.
HE_188	14	About six minutes after the start of the second monitoring, an older intern realized the need and urgency of performing a caesarean section and preparations for the operation were even started.
HE_188	15	Despite this, the surgery itself was performed only about 45 minutes later.
HE_188	16	Only at this stage did the junior interns - who managed the case alone - inform the duty manager and the senior physician in charge.
HE_188	17	The doctor ordered a caesarean section, a decision that was made too late.
HE_188	18	Even after the decision was made, it was claimed, the staff wasted additional valuable time and connected the mother to an unnecessary third monitor.
HE_188	19	The parents emphasized that due to the significant and negligent delay in making the decision to perform a caesarean section, and in performing the operation itself, the baby was born without a pulse and needed resuscitation.
HE_188	20	They attached an expert&#39;s opinion according to which the management of the birth and the treatment of the monitors deviated significantly from the recommendations of the position paper that was in effect at the time and from the accepted practice in delivery rooms.
HE_188	21	Another opinion on their behalf stated that the claimant was born suffering from perinatal asphyxia (a disruption in the supply of oxygen to the fetus around birth) and that there is a clear causal link between the asphyxia and his neurological damage.
HE_188	22	The plaintiffs stated that today their son suffers from severe neurological and developmental damage due to asphyxiation at birth: developmental delay, unbalanced epilepsy and cerebral palsy.
HE_188	23	According to them, performing a caesarean section at an earlier stage would have resulted in the rescue of their son from the womb in time, and could have prevented his severe damage.
HE_188	24	The plaintiffs described in the statement of claim the great suffering they and their son are going through, who will depend for the rest of his life on the supervision of others and their help in all daily activities.
HE_188	25	They stated that their lives have changed completely and they are now focused on their son and his needs.
HE_188	26	The Meir Hospital responded: &quot;The hospital is unable to provide an answer since the claim has not yet reached it.
HE_188	27	When the lawsuit arrives, it will be examined with the required professionalism.&quot;
HE_197	1	Senior American: Iran presents excessive and unrealistic demands in the nuclear talks
HE_197	2	A senior official approved the publication in Walla! According to which the Iranians demand that the US remove more sanctions than stipulated in the agreement, but are not willing to limit their nuclear program accordingly.
HE_197	3	According to him, the Biden administration believes that understandings can be reached before the Iranian presidential elections in June, but emphasized that they are also preparing for an explosion in the talks.
HE_197	4	A senior official at the US State Department, who is participating in the nuclear talks in Vienna, confirmed the publication today (Thursday) in Walla!
HE_197	5	According to which there are large gaps with Iran in the negotiations, and that the Iranians present excessive demands and are not willing to take the full steps they need to limit their nuclear program.
HE_197	6	Tomorrow there will be another round of indirect negotiations in Vienna between representatives of the United States and representatives of Iran mediated by the European Union and with the participation of the other powers - France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia and China.
HE_197	7	So far the negotiations are faltering and there has been no breakthrough.
HE_197	8	The American official confirmed that the Iranians demand that the US remove more sanctions than stipulated in the nuclear agreement, and that they impose fewer restrictions on the nuclear program than stipulated in the agreement - for example in regards to the advanced centrifuges.
HE_197	9	&quot;The choice is clear.
HE_197	10	If they want to return to the nuclear agreement, it is clear what Iran has to do,&quot; said the official.
HE_197	11	&quot;We don&#39;t know if the Iranians want to do this or not.
HE_197	12	It is possible to reach an understanding on returning to the agreement, but it is a matter of a political decision by the Iranian leadership.&quot;
HE_197	13	According to the American official, the Iranians are making excessive demands.
HE_197	14	However, the American official noted that the Biden administration believes that it is possible to reach an understanding on returning to the nuclear agreement before the Iranian presidential elections on June 18, if the regime in Tehran takes realistic positions during the negotiations, something that has not happened so far.
HE_197	15	&quot;We think an agreement can be reached,&quot; he said.
HE_197	16	&quot;We are not reinventing the wheel and this is not rocket engineering.&quot;
HE_197	17	In the same breath, the senior official at the US State Department noted that the Biden administration was preparing for a scenario in which Iran would not be ready to fully implement the nuclear agreement and the negotiations would explode.
HE_197	18	&quot;If this happens, the Biden administration will fight and do everything to make sure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon - we are also preparing for such a scenario - but we prefer to reach an understanding on returning to the agreement,&quot; he said.
HE_197	19	The American official added that the United States is ready to remove all sanctions that constitute a violation of the nuclear agreement, but demands that Iran return to implementing the agreement as it is worded and in full.
HE_197	20	&quot;You just have to read the agreement and implement it,&quot; said the American official.
HE_197	21	&quot;There will be no situation for the United States to do more than it needs and Iran to do less.
HE_197	22	We will see if the next round of negotiations will move things forward or if Iran will continue to make unrealistic demands.
HE_197	23	There are gaps, but they can be closed if Iran takes a realistic approach.&quot;
HE_205	1	The appeal was rejected, the members of the Hebrew community are required to leave within 14 days
HE_205	2	The Population and Immigration Authority rejected the appeal of 51 members of the Jewish community from Dimona who received a deportation order from the country last April.
HE_205	3	The authority ordered the members of the community to leave the country within 14 days.
HE_205	4	The letters say they were issued on August 9, but they arrived at the recipients on Monday this week, the eve of the holiday.
HE_205	5	The members of the community are expected to petition the court in Beer Sheva against the decision in the coming days.
HE_205	6	Dozens of members of the Jewish community received the deportation orders after in 2015 they applied on their own initiative to the Population Authority with a request to regularize their status, since they had settled in the country without a permit.
HE_205	7	The community was asked to provide the authority with a list of members without status, and did so.
HE_205	8	After that, the authority began to contact those without status and demand that they leave the country.
HE_205	9	Those targeted for deportation submitted appeal requests, and according to the Population Authority, each such case is examined on its merits, but in fact all appeals were rejected.
HE_205	10	Now they intend to start legal proceedings against their deportation.
HE_205	11	Attorney Omri Barbash, who represents the members of the Hebrew community together with Attorney Avigdor Feldman, said that they will appeal the decision to the court.
HE_205	12	One of the rejection letters sent by the Population Authority reached Israel and it details the reasons for rejecting the application of A, a 22-year-old young man from the community who has lived in Israel for the past decade.
HE_205	13	According to the Ministry of Interior data, A entered Israel in 2011 when he was only 12 years old using a tourist visa.
HE_205	14	In the letter it was not stated whether A arrived alone or together with his family since the expiration of his license, he is staying in Israel illegally and is doing justice to himself,&quot; it was written.
HE_205	15	Later in the letter it is stated that even if the center of A&#39;s life is in Israel, this does not justify receiving status in Israel.
HE_205	16	Compared to A who came to Israel in the last decade, there are members of the community destined for deportation who were born here.
HE_205	17	In April, Haaretz brought the story of Little Heraklis, 22 years old, who was born in Israel to parents who arrived in 1998 but never received status.
HE_205	18	Yilit&#39;s mother, Don, received a deportation order in April that also applies to her eight children who live in Israel.
HE_205	19	&quot;When we received the letter, it created a feeling of despair in me,&quot; Herklis said in April.
HE_205	20	&quot;I was born here, I grew up here, I was educated here, I don&#39;t know any other place in the world.
HE_205	21	This is my home, so why should I leave?&quot;
HE_205	22	.
HE_205	23	The Population Authority clarified in April that the deportation was done at the discretion of the then Minister of the Interior, Aryeh Deri.
HE_205	24	The mayor of Dimona, Benny Biton, then turned to Derai with a request to avoid the deportation of the Hebrews, whom he defined as an integral part of the city.
HE_205	25	&quot;It is impossible for them to be forced to leave their place of residence and part of their birthplace after many years,&quot; he wrote.
HE_205	26	&quot;As someone who has accompanied the community for many years, I will not let this move happen.&quot;
HE_205	27	MK Mossi Raz (Meretz) today (Saturday) defined the decision as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and said that community members are equal partners in Israeli society.
HE_205	28	&quot;This is their community and this is their place.
HE_205	29	This deportation can and should be stopped,&quot; Raz said.
HE_205	30	The Population and Immigration Authority responded: As we recently published, the members of the community received permanent status in 2003 according to the list compiled by the heads of the community themselves.
HE_205	31	Everyone who appeared on the list received status.
HE_205	32	The cases in question now relate to individual applicants, who stayed in Israel for a very long time without a legal visa, while knowingly violating the law in Israel.
HE_205	33	These are now asked to return to their country of citizenship, the United States, as is customary for any illegal resident.
HE_205	34	Each request is examined on its merits, and the attempt to associate each individual case with the &#39;expulsion of the community&#39; is a blatant deception.&quot;
HE_206	1	Demonstrations of support for the rioters in Acre go to Jewish neighborhoods
HE_206	2	The Arab residents of Acre will demonstrate again this week demanding the release of the city&#39;s residents, and for the first time tomorrow (Friday) they will leave the Old City and set up a protest tent at the place where the city resident Mor Janshvili was lynched, claiming that &quot;a herd of settlers attacked Arabs and tried to run them over&quot;, during the protests The violence.
HE_206	3	The protest tent will be erected at the entrance to the Wolfson neighborhood, which used to have an absolute Jewish majority, and in the last decade has been dealing with the mass abandonment of Jews and their pushing to the northern neighborhoods of the city and beyond.
HE_206	4	In the neighborhood there are several synagogues, a high yeshiva and members of the &quot;Urban Kibbutz&quot; of the &quot;Dror Israel&quot; movement live there.
HE_206	5	Among the demonstrators will be the families of riot detainees and those accused of the lynching, arson and looting during the &quot;Guardian of the Walls&quot; events.
HE_206	6	In the demonstrations and torch marches that have been held in recent weeks, the demonstrators carry Palestinian flags, chant slogans against the occupation state and demand the release of all riot detainees.
HE_206	7	Janshvili, the lynching victim, got into a riot zone on May 12 when he tried to save his mother who lives in the city&#39;s Wolfson neighborhood, was attacked by crowds and when he tried to escape he hit one of the attackers.
HE_206	8	Following this, dozens of rioters violently lynched him and hit him very hard.
HE_206	9	Of all the attackers who participated in the campaign of violence against him, only three were brought to justice.
HE_206	10	The monitoring committee of the Acre Arabs claimed that the police arrested only Arabs and did not arrest &quot;extremist settlers&quot; like Janashvili who harmed Arabs.
HE_206	11	In a post put up this morning by the leaders of the protest from the Arab society, which is widely supported by members of the Knesset from the Arab parties including Ra&#39;am and the &quot;Joint List&quot;, it is claimed that the police tried to prevent the demonstration from taking place.
HE_206	12	This morning one of the leaders of the nationalist protest was called in for questioning and it was demanded that the demonstration be canceled in an area where Jews live for fear of clashes.
HE_206	13	The monitoring committee refused the police inquiries and explained that the protest was peaceful and non-violent, and they wanted to show solidarity with the Arab residents of the Wolfson neighborhood &quot;whose population was attacked by settlers&quot;.
HE_206	14	In a post published by the monitoring committee, it was explained that during the days of the disturbances, the Arab protesters sought to &quot;protect their homes against police repression and settler attacks&quot;.
HE_206	15	In the follow-up committee of the Arabs of Acre, they emphasized that &quot;the authorities will not tell us when we can express our opinion and when we will be silent, only we are allowed to do so.&quot;
HE_206	16	On Tuesday, members of the monitoring committee called on the &quot;Palestinian people in Acre and throughout Palestine&quot; to now join the protests in view of the &quot;worsening of the condition of our detainees following the escape of the six prisoners&quot; on the eve of the holiday.
HE_206	17	The demonstration is expected to take place as mentioned tomorrow at 20:00 and apparently this time, due to the high tensions, there will be a police presence.
HE_206	18	Last week, the chairman of the joint list MK Ayman Odeh, who also participated in the residents&#39; demonstration in Acre, arrived at the protest tent, expressed support for the families of the detainees and promised that his deputy, MK Aida Toma Suleiman, a resident of the city, &quot;will present a plan to support the detainees and their families in the coming days.&quot;
HE_206	19	The residents&#39; protest in Acre also follows the filing of an indictment against another resident of the Old City, Hassan Eid (27), who earlier this week was accused of acts of nationalist terrorism when he took part in setting fire to the Effendi Hotel in Acre while there were about twenty frightened Jewish guests.
HE_206	20	According to the indictment, on 11.05.21 during the riots in Old Acre, Eid broke the entrance door of the Effendi, poured gasoline and set fire to the entrance lobby of the building.
HE_206	21	After the arson, his friends and neighbors arrived at the scene equipped with Molotov cocktails and they also joined in the attempts to set fire to the Jewish vacationers there.
HE_206	22	About 10 Jews were slightly to moderately injured as a result of the heavy smoke and fire.
HE_206	23	The winner of the Israel Prize, Avi Har Evan, who was staying with his wife at the hotel, was fatally burned and died of his injuries after about two weeks.
HE_206	24	An examination of a first source shows that, similar to the vast majority of those arrested in the bloody riots throughout the north, Eid was also unknown to the police before and had no previous criminal background.
HE_206	25	Eid&#39;s parents have a famous clothing and fashion store at the entrance to the market in the old city, and he worked for a living driving tornado boats for tourists in the port.
HE_206	26	In the monitoring committee of the Arabs of Acre, he returned and warned that if the &quot;occupation police and the occupation state&quot; do not meet their demands and release the rioters throughout the country, the young people will return to the streets and set them on fire.
HE_206	27	In the meantime, this morning the police issued a statement that yesterday three boys about 15 years old were arrested for questioning who attacked a worshiper in a synagogue in a neighborhood in the north of the city and vandalized the synagogue.
HE_206	28	According to the testimony of the residents of the city, during Shabbat in the middle of the evening prayer at the synagogue, boys came and kicked the door of the synagogue and broke the menorah at the entrance.
HE_206	29	According to the suspicion, the same boys also attacked a Jewish boy and spat on him.
HE_206	30	&quot;They are trying to silence us as if everything is calm,&quot; wrote Shira Amelkais in the &quot;Open Stage in Acre&quot; Facebook group.
HE_206	31	According to her, &quot;the children are afraid to cross this path&quot;, (next to the synagogue, Yak) and accused that there are those who are trying to drive the city&#39;s Jews out of the neighborhood.
HE_206	32	&quot;We must wake up and quickly,&quot; wrote Shay Korner, one of the worshipers of the synagogue who witnessed the event.
HE_206	33	The police claim that the background to the incident is a prank and not nationalistic.
HE_207	1	Just before the discussion on the nuclear deal: the launch of the missile into the Negev symbolizes the problem of governance in Syria
HE_207	2	.
HE_207	3	In a few days, senior security officials will fly to the US to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue with their counterparts.
HE_207	4	The explosion of the anti-tank missile in the Negev illustrates one of the issues that will be at the heart of the talks - the problem of the administration in Damascus, which, according to the officials, stems from the powers&#39; leniency towards the Iranian establishment
HE_207	5	The launch of the Syrian anti-aircraft missile during the night (Thursday) into Israeli territory symbolizes what officials in the system define as the &quot;acute governance problems&quot; in the country.
HE_207	6	The timing of the launch comes a few days before senior security officials, including Mossad head Yossi Cohen, fly to the United States to hold talks with their counterparts on the nuclear agreement, and the Syrian issue is expected to be at the heart of the talks after the nuclear issue.
HE_207	7	In Israel, it is estimated that the same loss of governance stems from the leniency of the powers, including the United States, in everything related to the regional expansion and support for terrorism by the Iranian Quds Force.
HE_207	8	In the last two years, according to reports, the IDF has increased the scope of attacks throughout Syria against Iranian targets in order to thwart arms smuggling, the process of establishing military bases and weapons production sites.
HE_207	9	However, the Iranians are not letting up in the process and are making an effort to change methods of operation to trick the Israeli intelligence community.
HE_207	10	In Israel, it is estimated that the Iranians succeeded in the past year, despite the sanctions, in raising their heads above water in regards to the economic crisis that befell them following the sanctions imposed on them by the former President of the United States, Donald Trump.
HE_207	11	In Israel it is estimated that Syrian President Bashar Assad is indeed obliged to the Iranians for their help in the war against the rebels and the global jihad organizations in the country&#39;s territory, but he would like to see them leave Syria or at least stop the process of establishing themselves which, according to foreign publications, is followed by strikes by the Israeli Air Force and as a result of the escape Investors and international companies.
HE_207	12	Russian President Vladimir Putin would also like to see the Iranians stop the process of Iranian establishment in Syria, but at this stage he chooses not to intervene.
HE_207	13	In doing so, Putin is playing a double game and does not object to the Israeli Air Force attacking Iranian targets throughout Syria.
HE_207	14	According to estimates, Mossad head Cohen&#39;s guidelines in the talks with the Americans will include a clear message according to which Iran will become stronger economically and later also militarily, but not only within Iran itself but throughout the Middle East in accordance with the emerging agreement between Washington and Tehran on the nuclear project.
HE_207	15	Examples of terrorist financing and an unceasing effort to destabilize are well reflected in Yemen through Iran&#39;s financing of the Houthis, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, and above all terrorist organizations is Hezbollah.
HE_207	16	Such a reality may increase regional instability, and therefore the behind-the-scenes criticism of the emerging agreement is also passed by the heads of Arab states.
HE_207	17	According to estimates in the Israeli security system, the signal that the immediate circle of the President of the United States Joe Biden does not delve into the affairs of the Middle East, is expressed through the enrichment of uranium to the level of 60% through new centrifuges and the increase of subversive activity in the region without a significant American response, which at this stage they would prefer to promote The agreement on the nuclear project.
HE_209	1	Gantz: It is impossible to act when everyone is talking, I turned to the ombudsman to investigate leaks from the security establishment
HE_209	2	.
HE_209	3	The Defense Minister warned against &quot;chatter&quot; in the background of fear of leaking security information and clarified that no discussion was held on changing the Israeli policy of ambiguity.
HE_209	4	At the end of a tour with the American Defense Minister in Nabatim, Gantz said: &quot;This is a very serious issue.
HE_209	5	This harms our forces and the interests of the State of Israel.
HE_209	6	It&#39;s irresponsible&quot;
HE_209	7	Defense Minister Benny Gantz responded today (Monday) to the fear of leaking security information to foreign media, saying that &quot;this is a very serious issue.
HE_209	8	It is impossible to act when everyone is talking about themselves.&quot;
HE_209	9	At the same time, he said that he contacted the Ombudsman and the Shin Bet to investigate the matter, but refused to comment on specific events.
HE_209	10	In response to the question of whether the subject of the actions came up in talks with the American Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, who is visiting Israel, Gantz replied that &quot;I heard no comments or reservations.&quot;
HE_209	11	Gantz said these things at the end of a joint visit with Austin to the Hadir aircraft squadron at the Nabatim base in the Negev, and clarified that it is necessary to investigate the phenomenon.
HE_209	12	&quot;We must not put up with the winks and practical stories of &#39;factors in the West&#39;.
HE_209	13	It harms our forces, the security and the interests of the State of Israel, and as far as I&#39;m concerned, I think there should be an in-depth investigation.
HE_209	14	I have no knowledge of a specific person who leaked, but it must stop.&quot;
HE_209	15	In response to the question of whether a change in the Israeli policy of ambiguity had been decided, or whether he believed that the purpose of the leaks was political, Gantz replied that there had been no discussion on the subject of ambiguity.
HE_209	16	&quot;I think this is irresponsible behavior.
HE_209	17	If it stems from personal or political interests, it is extremely serious in my eyes.
HE_209	18	I don&#39;t know where it comes from, I know where it doesn&#39;t come from.
HE_209	19	I think the Prime Minister has great experience in the political-security field and I would not underestimate him.
HE_209	20	I think that every other consideration should be put aside and I hope that this is what he is doing,&quot; Gantz said.
HE_209	21	Regarding the Iranian issue, the Minister of Defense said that &quot;Iran with nuclear potential at a point that is close to it - is something that is very bad for the world, for the region, and for Israel in that order.
HE_209	22	We must not reverse the order, this is a problem of the world.
HE_209	23	There is no place where Iran is not involved in instability, they are involved in Iraq, they are involved in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen.
HE_209	24	When they have nuclear capability, it will give them the opportunity to be even more aggressive in the region and we are constantly trying to convey these consequences to our partners.
HE_209	25	Therefore, beyond the diplomatic actions and the work on the nuclear agreement together with the United States and other countries, Israel must preserve its ability to act in a reliable, strong, good and independent manner.&quot;
HE_209	26	He further said that the defense establishment&#39;s position on the nuclear agreement is that &quot;the old agreement is not a good enough agreement.
HE_209	27	We need to continue the pressure on Iran, and reach an agreement without expiration dates, and with an extensive and unlimited monitoring capability.&quot;
HE_209	28	He added that in this matter &quot;we found a listening ear, and there is an American commitment to cooperation, even if we don&#39;t always agree 100% on every point.&quot;
HE_209	29	Gantz expanded on the issues that came up in the talks with his American counterpart.
HE_209	30	&quot;In the meetings we discussed all the strategic and security challenges: the nuclear agreements, the Iranian establishment in the Middle East, the normalization with Arab countries, the relations with the Palestinians, the need to strengthen relations with Jordan and Egypt and a wide range of other issues, including the issue of Chinese activity in the region.&quot;
HE_209	31	In addition, the topic of Turkish activity in the Mediterranean region, the building of power of Hamas and Hezbollah in civilian areas &quot;and the consequences of the opening of the investigation at the International Criminal Court in The Hague on this activity&quot; came up in the talks.
HE_209	32	Regarding this issue, Gantz said, &quot;The Americans support us.&quot;
HE_216	1	The Cabinet approved the ceasefire; Senior Israeli: It will start at 02:00
HE_216	2	The political-security cabinet today (Thursday) unanimously approved the ceasefire with Hamas at the end of three hours of discussion.
HE_216	3	A senior Hamas official said that the fighting would cease starting tonight at 02:00, and a senior Israeli official confirmed the statements.
HE_216	4	The Cabinet&#39;s decision was made at a time when rockets are being fired from the Gaza Strip towards the southern settlements.
HE_216	5	According to security officials, &quot;the IDF is attacking in the Gaza Strip and will continue to attack for at least the next hour.&quot;
HE_216	6	Due to the fear of the intensification of the shooting towards the beginning of the ceasefire, the IDF spokesman said that the residents of the settlements surrounding Gaza at a distance of up to seven kilometers from the border of the Gaza Strip are asked to stay in their homes, and in the vicinity of a protected area from now until further notice.
HE_216	7	&quot;There is a ban on all movement and activity in the open space in the area,&quot; it was reported.
HE_216	8	The Cabinet authorized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz to set the date for the beginning of the ceasefire in accordance with the talks with the Egyptian government.
HE_216	9	The cabinet also decided that MLA head Meir Ben Shabat will begin talks with Egypt to conclude the final details.
HE_216	10	An Israeli senior official said that the principle according to which the cease-fire will be held is &quot;quiet for quiet&quot; with an agreement in principle to hold discussions on additional issues related to Gaza later.
HE_216	11	According to a report on Egyptian television, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will send a security mission to Gaza and Israel to stabilize the ceasefire.
HE_216	12	On behalf of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office, it was reported that &quot;the political-security cabinet unanimously accepted the recommendation of all the security forces, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the head of the Mossad and the head of the National Security Agency, to accept the Egyptian initiative for a bilateral ceasefire without any conditions, which will enter Effective at a time to be agreed later.
HE_216	13	The Chief of Staff, the military echelon and the head of the Shin Bet reviewed before the ministers Israel&#39;s great achievements in the campaign, some of them unprecedented.
HE_216	14	The political echelon emphasizes that the reality on the ground will determine the continuation of the campaign.&quot;
HE_216	15	Some foreign reports claim that the agreement between Israel and Hamas includes the cessation of the deportation of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
HE_216	16	A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said that &quot;the ceasefire deadline is two in the morning and the resistance is prepared for any development.
HE_216	17	We received guarantees from the mediators that the aggression on Gaza would stop.
HE_216	18	The resistance registered a new victory and a new equation, we received guarantees that the occupation would withdraw from Sheikh Jarrah and Al-Aqsa.&quot;
HE_216	19	Another source in the organization said that &quot;Israel ran away from the blows of the resistance and failed to achieve its goals.&quot;
HE_216	20	However, a senior Israeli official rejected the statements about Sheikh Jarrah, saying that &quot;the ceasefire agreement is without conditions.
HE_216	21	Unequivocally, there are no agreements on the issue of Jerusalem or Sheikh Jarrah, and the claims to that effect are unfounded.&quot;
HE_216	22	During the cabinet meeting, Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi and Shin Bet chief Nadav Argman told the cabinet ministers that &quot;we exhausted, we hit everything we wanted and planned, two or three days would not have resulted in a more significant achievement.&quot;
HE_216	23	Another Israeli official who participated in the meeting said that &quot;the security establishment presented an intelligence picture according to which Hamas suffered a very severe military blow to all of its formations, including the most sensitive formations.
HE_216	24	They have very few abilities left.
HE_216	25	The array they have left is missiles including a range that reaches the center of the country - but even here the capabilities have been significantly damaged.&quot;
HE_216	26	Officials who participated in the meeting noted that Transportation Minister Miri Regev (Likud) attacked the army and bluntly asked the Chief of Staff several times why they were not continuing the operation. &quot;70 percent of the public wants us to continue the operation,&quot; said Regev.
HE_216	27	Kochavi replied to her: &quot;If the political echelon directs me to continue attacking, I can continue, but I do not recommend it.&quot;
HE_218	1	Bennett, you are not the only option: three more options for establishing an alternative government
HE_218	2	.
HE_218	3	If Sa&#39;ar and Lieberman unite into one faction; If the chairman of Israel Beitenu succeeds in canceling the boycott he announced against the ultra-Orthodox; if the factions from all ends of the political spectrum succeed in uniting around the type that is hard to hate, Benny Gantz - it will be possible to form a government and pull the country out of the mud.
HE_218	4	Every day that passes makes Yair Lapid look more mature, more worthy and more suitable for the position of Prime Minister, which he dreams of long before entering politics.
HE_218	5	Lapid&#39;s conduct inspires respect.
HE_218	6	The peace of mind, the precise messages, the patience, the gentlemen and the recognition that the country is more important than him.
HE_218	7	With Lapid, it&#39;s not out of the question and out loud.
HE_218	8	He freezes his life&#39;s dream in favor of Branesh who won 7 mandates (and brings only 6 of them to the deal), because there is no other way to pull the country out of the mud.
HE_218	9	Why?
HE_218	10	Maybe there are other ways?
HE_218	11	Let me offer three alternative options: since Bennett now only has 6 seats, while Lieberman and Gantz are bigger than him and Sa&#39;ar is equal to him, why don&#39;t Gideon Sa&#39;ar and Avigdor Lieberman unite into a technical block of 13 seats, which appears to be a ruling party much more to the right?
HE_218	12	Sa&#39;ar will be the first prime minister in rotation on behalf of this bloc.
HE_218	13	Lieberman is the Minister of Finance.
HE_218	14	Such a coalition would be much more balanced.
HE_218	15	Bennett will be invited to it as Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
HE_218	16	He could agree, or refuse and go to the fifth election, where he would crash.
HE_218	17	Will Lapid do such a thing?
HE_218	18	No.
HE_218	19	He promised Bennett to go with him to the Brotherhood Take 2, and he will not break the promise, unless Naftali is the one who broke it.
HE_218	20	The second option also begins with the Sa&#39;ar-Lieberman connection and continues with the ultra-Orthodox.
HE_218	21	For it to happen, Lieberman has to cancel the boycott he announced on the ultra-Orthodox and take an anti-nausea pill.
HE_218	22	or two.
HE_218	23	Not to mention another operation to shorten the fuse, after the previous one failed (with Netanyahu).
HE_218	24	Sa&#39;ar and Gantz are accepted by the ultra-orthodox and Rabbi Kanievsky.
HE_218	25	First storm in the rotation, something the ultra-orthodox will like very much.
HE_218	26	A second torch, they will like it less but will get used to it.
HE_218	27	The continuation of the fast connection to the government will be an adequate compensation.
HE_218	28	Instead of Bennett, there are Gafni and Litzman, with a larger mandate.
HE_218	29	The government is sworn in, Bennett is in the opposition, Amichai Shikli is a member of the State Audit Committee.
HE_218	30	Is Lieberman capable of such a blatant violation of an election promise?
HE_218	31	ask him
HE_218	32	I&#39;m scared.
HE_218	33	The third alternative is similar, but different in essence: the government will be defined as an emergency government for two years, and it will be headed by someone named Benny Gantz.
HE_218	34	After all, in November he should, in any case, be prime minister according to the law, which is still in force.
HE_218	35	Gantz is accepted by the ultra-Orthodox, accepted by the Arabs, accepted by almost everyone.
HE_218	36	It&#39;s hard to hate this guy.
HE_218	37	And what&#39;s more: even the pure value Sheikli will not be able to say that he will not sit under Gantz.
HE_218	38	Bennett&#39;s promise was not to sit under the torch.
HE_218	39	So here, we brought a chief of staff as you requested.
HE_218	40	Any questions?
HE_M_001	1	Economy - we will manage to stabilize the economy.
HE_M_001	2	The principles of the economic concept are a free economy with social sensitivity in a global economy and a competitive market, there is a need for budgetary discipline, tax reduction, an efficiently run capital market and growth in the private sector.
HE_M_001	3	The government must strive to create economic opportunities for the entire population, and take care of those who cannot take advantage of these opportunities for all the able-bodied to work and integrate into the employment market, so that the government can keep the funds to support those who are truly unable to do so.
HE_M_001	4	The best way to create economic opportunities for all is through investment in education and national infrastructure.
HE_M_001	5	Most politicians and experts claimed that there is almost nothing the government can do to deal with the crisis except to raise taxes or, alternatively, to adopt plans whose implementation will force the government to spend more and more money that it did not have.
HE_M_001	6	The Minister of Finance at the time, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected the same claims and started implementing an ambitious reform plan that he devised with the support of the Prime Minister at the time, Ariel Sharon.
HE_M_001	7	First, Netanyahu argued, the government must act decisively.
HE_M_001	8	He maintained this approach even when the local crisis intensified as a result of international processes, such as a global recession, the bursting of the technological bubble and security instability in the local sector.
HE_M_001	9	All of these only exacerbated the immediate and urgent need for appropriate economic reform.
HE_M_001	10	Netanyahu even emphasized that the lack of free competition in the Israeli economy has led to shuffling and the creation of a gap compared to the economic systems of other countries in the world (such as Singapore, Ireland and Spain), for two decades.
HE_M_001	11	These countries adopted the free market reform compared to Israel, which still refused to part with its socialist past.
HE_M_001	12	Second, instead of raising taxes and increasing government spending, Netanyahu chose the opposite path, emphasizing the fact that Israel&#39;s economy has collapsed under the burden of taxes and that the public sector is overinflated (55% of GNP).
HE_M_001	13	Expenses were reduced and the belt was tightened while taxes (personal, business and VAT) were drastically reduced.
HE_M_001	14	The budget reform was only part of an extensive agenda.
HE_M_001	15	The Likud government even increased and saved the pension benefits of many citizens, by providing support to a system that was facing bankruptcy.
HE_M_001	16	Massive investment was made in infrastructure and many government companies that proved ineffective were privatized.
HE_M_001	17	At the end of the process, the Likud government turned to dealing with the capital market as well, while dismantling the banking duopoly that held as prisoners almost two-thirds of the savings of the Israeli public.
HE_M_001	18	As a result of the reform, Israel has enjoyed a stable and robust economic system whose growth percentages have risen beyond 5% in the last five years.
HE_M_001	19	The number of unemployed was reduced by half, the national debt was sharply reduced and the budget was almost balanced.
HE_M_001	20	Inflation and interest rates are low, and the financial system rests on a more stable foundation.
HE_M_001	21	These reforms even corrected the deficiencies in the welfare system and changed the situation in which people able to work preferred to receive high unemployment benefits and income security, over setting aside high tax portions from a monthly salary.
HE_M_001	22	A situation that weighed even more heavily on those who went to work and paid taxes legally.
HE_M_001	23	Worse than that - a cycle of poverty and dependency was created in places where the value of work decreased and an increasing number of people joined the group of permanent unemployed.
HE_M_001	24	This circle has become a social problem, as well as an economic one.
HE_M_001	25	Thanks to the reform initiated by Netanyahu, many Israelis have returned to take part in the labor market, and since more Israelis are engaged in productive work, the public coffers are full and the current government has sufficient financial resources to support those who, due to their age or physical disabilities, cannot work.
HE_M_001	26	The reforms mentioned below have helped to strengthen Israel&#39;s resilience in the face of the current crisis, but instead of waiting for anger to pass, the Likud government led by Netanyahu will prefer to initiate additional reforms that will strengthen the Israeli economy even more.
HE_M_001	27	These reforms will include: Further reduction of taxes Taxes in Israel are still too high.
HE_M_001	28	Given our geopolitical situation, we must be more active than our competitors in this area and the last five years have shown that indeed, reducing the tax burden has produced economic growth.
HE_M_001	29	Competitive economic systems have reduced business taxes and accelerated the process as a response to the current economic crisis.
HE_M_001	30	Israel also needs to keep up.
HE_M_001	31	On top of that, we must create a long-term tax reduction plan before the current plan expires in 2010, thus sending a clear message that the economic reforms in Israel will continue.
HE_M_001	32	Finally, we must formulate a long-term plan to reduce the VAT, which is a regressive and disproportionately oppressive tax on the weaker sections.
HE_M_001	33	Reform of the Israel Land Administration The monopoly held by the Israeli government over the lands has been a long-standing barrier to the development of the Israeli economy.
HE_M_001	34	Ending it by the Likud government and immediately cutting the bureaucratic processes related to freezing the land for construction, will end the real estate shortage and create immediate opportunities for young couples to purchase houses, especially those who served in the army.
HE_M_001	35	This reform will breathe life into the dying construction sector and reignite economic development.
HE_M_006	1	The joint list is fighting for a just peace in the region based on the resolutions of the United Nations; the end of the occupation of all the territories conquered in 1967, the dismantling of all the settlements and the racial separation wall, the release of the political prisoners, the establishment of an independent sovereign Palestinian state within the borders of June 4, 1967, the destruction of East Jerusalem, and a solution Right to the problem of Palestinian refugees, who guarantees the right of return according to UN Resolution 194.
HE_M_015	1	Education In recent years we have witnessed a significant decline in the quality of education in Israel and the loss of the pursuit of excellence, these may have a negative impact on GDP.
HE_M_015	2	The preparation of the young generation and its training for the demands of the future demand adaptation of the education system to the requirements of the 21st century - in order to prepare a new generation of excellent students, leading academics and groundbreaking researchers.
HE_M_015	3	To this end, we will act as follows: Increasing administrative independence in the education system, including the ability to hire outstanding teachers on a personal contract.
HE_M_015	4	Changing the reward model according to parameters of innovation and excellence in teaching instead of reward based on seniority.
HE_M_015	5	Synchronization of vacation days in the education system with vacation days in the economy.
HE_M_015	6	Strengthening the status and salary of the young teachers.
HE_M_015	7	Preventing the leakage of anti-Israeli content into the education system - about half of the Arab-Israeli students who study in institutions abroad, study in the Palestinian Authority and Jordan - in the Islamic College in Hebron, Bir Zeit and Najah.
HE_M_015	8	They make up about a quarter of all Arab teachers in the education system.
HE_M_015	9	The spillover of anti-Israeli content from the Palestinian education system to the Israeli one must be prevented, therefore they must pass an adjustment to teach in Israel and take a citizenship test before they can integrate into the Israeli education system.
HE_M_015	10	Higher education, research and development - The quality of higher education is the key to the qualitative advantage of the State of Israel, but only the Weizmann Institute and the Hebrew University are ranked among the 100 best universities in the world for 2020, and four of the seven ranked Israeli universities have dropped their places in the ranking of the 2,000 best universities (according to CWUR).
HE_M_015	11	Also, according to a study by the International Institute IMD, although the State of Israel is ranked 3rd in public spending on education as a percentage of the GDP, in terms of the quality of education we have fallen to 23rd place.
HE_M_015	12	We will work to strengthen the higher education institutions and significantly increase the research budgets.
HE_M_015	13	Making Jewish-Zionist education accessible to every Jewish child in the Diaspora through the establishment of a Jewish-Zionist education network whose goal is to strengthen the connection and sense of belonging of the young people growing up in the Diaspora and Israel while encouraging aliyah and leading an embracing and inclusive Judaism.
HE_M_015	14	Applying the &quot;National Culture Basket&quot; project to all students in Israel and including the education for cultural consumption within the core studies.
HE_M_017	1	The security of national security should be at the top of the order of priorities with the understanding that the very existence of the state, its integrity and the security of its citizens are threatened in a real way by its enemies.
HE_M_017	2	The State of Israel is a regional power, in order for its enemies to be afraid to challenge it, a doctrine based on the prevention of threats that have not been resolved in the settlement procedures through a preliminary step, that is, to be on the side of the initiative and not on the side that reacts and contains, must be adopted.
HE_M_017	3	Although this policy has a price in the short term, in the long term it will bring security, peace and stability that have never been here before.
HE_M_017	4	Israel&#39;s military strength, deterrence capacity and social resilience are a necessary condition for security in the present and a chance for peace in the future.
HE_M_017	5	Handling the main security elements will include: strict maintenance of the IDF&#39;s qualitative advantage over any other army in the Middle East.
HE_M_017	6	A security concept based on reliable and tangible deterrence, initiative and a willingness to take preliminary steps.
HE_M_017	7	The establishment of a missile force in order to back up the skills of the air force, on which the IDF is based today, and which would give the IDF the ability to strike, in a fatal way, at any point in distant countries with which we do not have a common border.
HE_M_017	8	The definition of the threat of a serious injury to the rear using precision weapons as intolerable, following the massive entry of precision weapons into our region.
HE_M_017	9	This is in addition to the nuclear, chemical and biological threat that has long been defined as an existential threat.
HE_M_017	10	Preservation of the People&#39;s Army model and the IDF&#39;s historic role as the melting pot of Israeli society, as instructed by the late Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to the late Chief of Staff Yaakov Dori in 1949: &quot;The army must also serve as a pioneering educational center for the youth in Israel , born in the country and immigrated.
HE_M_017	11	The army must educate a generation of pioneers, healthy in body and spirit, bold and loyal, that will unite the rifts of the tribes and exiles and will be qualified to fulfill the historical vocations of the State of Israel out of self-fulfillment, as the builder of the homeland and settler of its wastelands.&quot;
HE_M_017	12	Passing the conscription law in second and third reading, lowering the exemption age and establishing a separate system for the ultra-Orthodox and members of minorities within the Home Front Command or the National-Civil Service.
HE_M_017	13	Defining the defense budget so that it is 6% of GDP and will not be subject to political bargaining.
HE_M_017	14	The transfer of responsibility for the implementation of the National-Civilian Service Law to the Home Front Command in order to prevent a situation in which the National Service will be a political &quot;dowry&quot; within the framework of the coalition agreements as is the case today.
HE_M_017	15	Internal Security.
HE_M_017	16	Internal security is essential for the sense of personal security of the citizens of the State of Israel, as well as for ensuring stability and a prosperous economy.
HE_M_017	17	Therefore, we will work to advance this goal through the following means: implementing a policy of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; against criminal and nationalistic terrorism, while giving central priority to the fight against crime, including organized crime, agricultural crime, the scourge of drugs, violence and public corruption, the robbery of state lands and the illegal construction.
HE_M_017	18	A national plan to strengthen and empower the Israel Police at a cost of NIS 3 billion, which will include an addition to the current strength of 3,000 police officers: an addition of 1,000 police officers for the Negev, 1,000 for the North and 1,000 additional police officers in the urban police stations with an emphasis on mixed cities.
HE_M_017	19	Security on campuses throughout the country - strengthening the sense of security of students and teaching staff on campuses, expanding the &quot;Nakba Law&quot; in order to improve the ability to deny budgets from entities that take actions against the principles of the state, and to create a deterrent sanction in the case of incitement against the state and waving enemy flags on campus.
HE_M_017	20	Regional agreements and foreign policy.
HE_M_017	21	We believe that the conflict of the State of Israel with its neighbors is not a territorial conflict but a combined three-dimensional conflict: Arab states-Palestinians-Israeli Arabs.
HE_M_017	22	The conflict with our Arab neighbors began before the establishment of the state and long before 1967, when Jordan and Egypt still controlled Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip and there was not a single Jewish settlement in these areas.
HE_M_017	23	The settlement with the Palestinians must be part of an overall settlement, which will include peace agreements with Arab countries and the exchange of territories and populations of Israeli Arabs.
HE_M_017	24	This is the place to clarify that no Arab citizen will be moved from his home.
HE_M_017	25	The only thing that will move is the border, and this is contrary to the idea of ​​the transfer as it appears in Berel Katznelson&#39;s writings.
HE_M_017	26	There is no point in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians only because it will not solve the problem of loyalty of the Israeli Arabs, will not bring political and economic profit from ties with Arab countries and will not bring to an end the conflict between Israel and the Arab world.
HE_M_017	27	Such an arrangement is possible because today many already understand that the Palestinian problem is not the main problem or the cause of the instability in the Middle East.
HE_M_017	28	The events of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere prove this.
HE_M_017	29	The moderate Arab countries also understand this, and understand that the threat to them is not the State of Israel and Zionism, but the extreme Islamic organizations such as ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra, the Muslim Brotherhood and others.
HE_M_017	30	That is why today, for the first time, it is possible to reach a comprehensive settlement whose terms will be reasonable and mutually accepted from Israel&#39;s point of view.
HE_M_017	31	The State of Israel and the Arab minority.
HE_M_017	32	We expect the Arabs of Israel to show loyalty to the country in which they live - as the late Prof. Ben Zion Dinor, the former Minister of Education on behalf of Mapai and a two-time winner of the Israel Prize, said: &quot;The Arabs have all the rights in the Land of Israel, but no right to the Land of Israel.&quot;
HE_M_017	33	We will not put up with the dangerous phenomenon of radicalization among the Arab members of the Knesset, who incite against the country in whose parliament they serve.
HE_M_017	34	The judicial system must be &quot;equipped&quot; with appropriate legislation that will require a deterrent punishment in the case of incitement against the state, participation in meetings with Israel&#39;s enemies and opposition to the basic principles of the Zionist state, and prevent the recurrence of the case in which the High Court overturned the election committee&#39;s decision after &quot;Israel Beytinu&quot; led to its disqualification of Balad from running in the Knesset elections.
HE_M_017	35	On the other hand, budgets must be strengthened and invested in moderate Israeli Arabs and their representatives who want to integrate into Israeli society and recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
HE_M_017	36	This means that the non-Jewish minority that lives among us, that identifies with the state and contributes to it, should receive all the respect and rights - up to half the kingdom.
HE_M_017	37	Whoever lives with us and works against us - he must be fought to the bitter end.
HE_M_022	1	Until the amendment of the old-age pensions - supplementing the income of elderly people with no income other than the old-age pension, up to the level of the minimum wage.
HE_M_022	2	Raising the disability allowance to the level of the minimum wage in the absence of reform in the taxation mechanism - it will be guaranteed that supplementing the income of an elderly person, who has no other income, will result in an income equal to the minimum wage for an individual.
HE_M_025	1	Enemies of Israel: The war against Israel&#39;s enemies will be total, without negotiations, without concessions and without compromises, those who so far have brought only more wars, fire blood and bereavement.
HE_M_025	2	Applying sovereignty to all parts of the Land of Israel that were liberated in the Six Day War and regulating the status of Israel&#39;s enemies in the Arab countries surrounding our country.
HE_M_025	3	IDF: Restoring security and deterrence for IDF soldiers.
HE_M_025	4	Moving from defense to attack, from the policy of &#39;containment of the enemy&#39; to his elimination and destruction.
HE_M_025	5	The value of the victory is returned to the IDF.
HE_M_030	1	Education &quot;Mosbin teaches babies in every country, in every town and town and in every city and town...
HE_M_030	2	that the world does not exist except in the mouths of the infants of the Rabbi&#39;s house&quot; (Rambam, Halchot Talmud Torah, PB2).
HE_M_030	3	&quot;Every sage in Israel is commanded to teach all students...
HE_M_030	4	As it is said: &#39;And you memorized it for your sons.&#39;
HE_M_030	5	From the word of mouth your children learned - these are your students&quot; (Rambam, Halchot Talmud Torah, PA).
HE_M_030	6	As part of the national priorities, the field of education must be placed at the top.
HE_M_030	7	Education is the main lever for the advancement of the Israeli person and society, and for the existence of the State of Israel.
HE_M_030	8	Strengthening Torah education and imparting it to all children of Israel, in all streams of education, will make a significant contribution to our establishment as a society, and as a nation that absorbs knowledge and values ​​from Israel&#39;s Torah and its glorious tradition.
HE_M_030	9	Knowledge of different cultures and traditions, the heritage of the ethnic groups in Israel, will contribute to respect and tolerance between the different parts of society.
HE_M_030	10	The Shas movement supports the core plan of the Dovrat committee report, and even implements it in the schools of its education stream - &#39;the type of Torah education&#39;, while making adjustments to the nature of its unique Torah study.
HE_M_030	11	Therefore, the Shas movement will work to promote the following issues: the comparison of budgets for education between all streams of education and between the periphery and the center.
HE_M_030	12	Improving the status of teachers and raising their salary.
HE_M_030	13	Free education from kindergarten until the end of high school and yeshiva studies and subsidized studies at the academy for students from weaker strata (progressive tuition).
HE_M_030	14	Ensuring full resources for the inclusion of children with special needs in regular educational settings.
HE_M_030	15	Renewal of the feeding plant in schools of all streams, with the participation of funding from the parents, according to their financial capacity.
HE_M_030	16	Vocational training for every discharged soldier and unprofessional family head.
IT_001	1	Dragons:
IT_001	2	"""On Ita we decide, we do not leave the issue to the next government."""
IT_001	3	The die is cast.
IT_001	4	Mario Draghi, as anticipated by the July 31 Messenger, confirmed that he will handle the privatization of Ita Airways, but another 10 days will be needed for the proposals arrived from Msc-Lufthansa and Certares-Delta Air France to be fully consistent with the government's wishes.
IT_001	5	The premier provided clarity at the end of the BoD, explaining at a press conference the next steps and reiterating the stakes within which the divestment of the national airline must be placed.
IT_001	6	As for the choice of Ita's partner, it is not my intention to leave this issue to the next government.
IT_001	7	We have to do our duty all the way.
IT_001	8	The choice of the winner in this competition will have to be made within the time frame that the Ministry of Economy and Finance will give, which is very short.
IT_001	9	A response to Giorgia Meloni, strongly opposed to the sale of the newco.
IT_001	10	I hope President Draghi will deny speculation that the process of selling Ita to Lufthansa will be accelerated, the leader of Fratelli d'Italia had said Tuesday.
IT_001	11	But Draghi also touched on some more political issues.
IT_001	12	And as his agenda has become a campaign theme, the premier explained, Prompt response and credibility, these are the characteristics of my agenda.
IT_001	13	When I started I didn't have a Draghi agenda, which is made up of answers to problems, goals achieved.
IT_001	14	It is difficult to say that there is an agenda: it is the ready responses to problems that arise, such as the needs of the economy, of families, of the poorest families.
IT_001	15	In short: Prompt response and credibility.
IT_001	16	And the government had domestic and international credibility, having high international credit is most important.
IT_001	17	But he also wanted to take a big pebble off his shoe when he revealed that at the conclusion of the cabinet meeting, he had extended best vacation wishes to ministers who would not be campaigning, while to those who would be campaigning, I truly wished that all wishes and dreams would come true.
IT_001	18	I am very close to all of them....
IT_001	19	An obvious jab at politicians-many in his government as well-who have been prodigal in these hours with miraculous promises.
IT_001	20	There was no lack of response to Matteo Salvini, who, from Lampedusa, had accused the government of giving an undignified reception to migrants: I think the government has worked well.
IT_001	21	Much more could have been done, but everything possible was done.
IT_001	22	And to those who asked him how to deal with the warm autumn that may be on the horizon.
IT_001	23	"I don't know what political formula,"" Draghi replied, ""but social cohesion and, as Guido Crosetto may have said, political cohesion, a climate of awareness of the difficulties that all Italians will face at the end of the year."
IT_001	24	This should inspire government action in my opinion.
IT_001	25	Regarding the Ita dossier, the premier added: The procedure was initiated in the spring through a dpcm and managed by the Treasury.
IT_001	26	"However, the two bids submitted by the two consortia are not ""fully consistent"" with the principles established by the Dpcm."
IT_001	27	Minister Franco himself recalled them in succession: maximization of the company's value and guarantees on the employment front, industrial development, and governance structure.
IT_001	28	In short, Msc-Lufthansa on the one hand and Certares-Delta-Air France on the other now have 10 days to comply, improve their proposals and return to the assault, formulate new binding offers.
IT_001	29	THE LACKS Before divesting Ita, the government wants to have strong guarantees on the employment and governance fronts.
IT_001	30	Issues that are evidently still inconclusive within the two proposals.
IT_001	31	The central issue, according to sources close to the dossier, concerns the powers of the Treasury, which should have about 20 percent of the privatized company.
IT_001	32	And that it asks for a say in strategic choices, precisely for the purpose of safeguarding the 1.3 billion investment used to launch Ita.
IT_001	33	No encroachment, it is clarified, but the possibility of pointing the way to development, increasing employment levels, the development of international routes, and the revitalization of Made in Italy.
IT_001	34	In the morning, it was the Lufthansa Group that had urged the government to make a decision quickly.
IT_001	35	We have written a letter to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi about the fact that we need to be quick and that our patience is not infinite, had explained CEO Carsten Spohr, who now, together with Msc owner Gianluigi Aponte, will have the burden of formulating a new proposal to take over 80 percent of the tricolor company for 800-850 million euros.
IT_001	36	However, Draghi has pleased the unions, Fit Cisl in the lead, who want rapid privatization.
IT_001	37	"Ten days,"" the premier concluded, ""and the file will be closed."
IT_002	1	Incentives for car changers.
IT_002	2	Up to €3,500
IT_002	3	Incentives of up to 3,500 euros are coming for those who buy a euro 6 car.
IT_002	4	The House Budget Committee approved a reworded Pd amendment to the Relaunch Decree (34 of 2020) that provides a state bonus of 1,500 euros, if the seller gives a discount of at least another 2,000 euros, for those who scrap a vehicle at least 10 years old.
IT_002	5	The incentive is halved without scrapping.
IT_002	6	The bonus applies to purchases between Aug. 1 and Dec. 31, 2020, of cars with emission limits between 61 and 110 grams per kilometer and priced up to 40 thousand euros exclusive of VAT.
IT_002	7	The subsidy for the purchase of hybrid and electric cars is strengthened for the last five months of 2020, increasing by 4 thousand euros in the case of scrapping and 2 thousand without.
IT_002	8	In detail, in the case of scrapping, the incentive for cars with emissions between 0 and 20 grams per km of Co2, now at 6,000 euros, rises to 10,000 euros (of which 2,000 euros will be borne by the seller), while for vehicles with emissions between 21 and 60 grams per km, it rises from the current 2,500 euros to 6,500 euros.
IT_002	9	"Also included in the amendment approved by the Budget Committee is a 60 percent discount on transfer tax charges for those who scrap a euro 0, 1, 2, or 3 car and purchase between July 1 and Dec. 31 ""with a used vehicle of a category not less than euro 6."""
IT_002	10	Other measures.
IT_002	11	The committee (see also table on page) gave the green light to the amendment for immediate cash refund of concert tickets in case of permanent cancellation.
IT_002	12	Green light then to the amendment to adjust the disability pensions now stopped at 285 euros even for the totally disabled: they are raised to at least 516 euros.
IT_002	13	The rule creates an ad hoc fund for increases in 100 percent disability checks and comes after the Constitutional Court's June 23 ruling, which mandated an increase to the old 1 million lire civil disability allowance for individuals with severe disabilities, regardless of the 60-year age requirement.
IT_002	14	The fund contemplates an allocation of 46 million euros for 2020.
IT_002	15	Last-minute changes include one million euros in 2020 to support investments in the redevelopment and enhancement of UNESCO sites.
IT_002	16	Fifteen million, in 2020, comes to increase the resources of the Culture Fund, aimed at allocating the Culture Card, given to poor families for books, cultural products and services.
IT_002	17	For the year 2023, the title of Italian Capital of Culture, will be awarded to the cities of Bergamo and Brescia, in order to promote the socio-economic and cultural revitalization of the area most affected by the Coronavirus emergency.
IT_002	18	By the end of January 2022, the two cities must submit a unified project to the Ministry of Cultural Heritage with initiatives aimed at increasing the enjoyment of cultural heritage.
IT_002	19	On taxation matters, the stop to the first installment of Imu for 2020 also stands out for properties falling under cadastral category D (factories, sheds) in use by companies engaged in the business of setting up exhibition facilities as part of fairs or events.
IT_002	20	And again, almost unanimous green light to 150 million more for peer primary and secondary schools: 100 million for schools with children up to 6 years old and 50 million for tuition for older children.
IT_002	21	While to avoid the risk of coronavirus infection, until June 30, 2021, passenger cars for third-party use, such as cabs and nccs, may also be used for scheduled passenger services.
IT_006	1	Interventions for 110% are growing rapidly, but still far behind traditional energy efficiency.
IT_006	2	The problem is that all the pieces of the puzzle to leave have only recently lined up
IT_006	3	The hour of truth strikes for Superbonus.
IT_006	4	With the changes introduced by the Budget Law and the clarifications in the Revenue Agency's December 22 circular, the picture is basically set and it is therefore possible to really start work.
IT_006	5	So far, in fact, beyond the goodwill and interest of condominiums and owners, businesses and energy service providers, uncertainties related to interpretations of the regulations have acted as a brake on the grand start that had been hoped for.
IT_006	6	The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether the Superbonus will really succeed or be a flop.
IT_006	7	Open construction sites.
IT_006	8	According to data from Economic Development Minister Patuanelli, as of Jan. 11, some 1,700 construction sites had been started, and more than 200 million euros in bonuses had been booked.
IT_006	9	Certainly not an exciting balance when one considers that in 2019 (latest data released by Enea) energy efficiency measures worth 3.5 billion euros were initiated.
IT_006	10	It should be considered, however, that although the Superbonus regulations came into effect on July 1, their implementation had to wait for the ministerial decrees with technical requirements and rules for asseverations, both of which were not published in the Official Gazette until October 6.
IT_006	11	So in fact in 2020 the operation of the facility has been limited to just over two months.
IT_006	12	Interpretive difficulties.
IT_006	13	Also weighing on the delay in starting construction, moreover, was the initial lack of clarity in the text of the law, which has been supplemented gradually over the months.
IT_006	14	Among the issues resolved along the way: reduced majorities in condominiums, zoning regularity for common parts, how to access the building, and the type of facilities to be considered in defining functionally autonomous properties.
IT_006	15	Then at the end of the year came the go-ahead for the Superbonus for single owners of properties with multiple apartments (up to four under sole or joint ownership), which had been previously blocked by the Internal Revenue Service.
IT_006	16	And also, again to facilitate the work and overturning what the Agency had previously argued, the possibility of including roof insulation among the eligible works, regardless of the presence in the attic of heated rooms, the reduced majority and no longer unanimity for the yes to the work at their own expense by only the affected condominiums.
IT_006	17	Delayed responses.
IT_006	18	In addition to the unclear rules in the first instance, moreover, the difficulties in opening construction sites were also weighed down by the delay in the launch of the circular with which the Internal Revenue Service officially provided answers to questions raised by technicians and businesses since the days after the rules were launched.
IT_006	19	It was not until late December, in fact, that guidance arrived on issues such as: how to calculate spending ceilings in condominiums and the rights of owners in the case of unheated rooms (stores and garages); access to deductions for condominiums detached from central heating; rules for apartments in captive condominiums; equating stoves, fireplaces and air conditioners with heating systems; and the possibility for Third Sector entities to upgrade non-housing properties (e.g., those intended for RSAs) with 110%.
IT_006	20	The government website dedicated to the facility is online.
IT_006	21	On the Superbonus, however, interest from industry players is definitely high.
IT_006	22	There were also many initiatives to enable discussion on operational issues.
IT_006	23	The latest is that of IRENE network, (Network of Enterprises for the Energetic Renovation of Buildings), which has given birth to a Forum that has more than 200 members.
IT_006	24	Then, since Jan. 19, the government website dedicated to the Superbonus has been online with regulations, documentation to be filled out, and a section with answers to frequently asked questions by the Internal Revenue Service and Enea.
IT_007	1	Rice turns out to be stronger than the pandemic:
IT_007	2	consumption and sales reward the Vercelli area
IT_007	3	If there is one industry that has not been adversely affected by the covid pandemic in 2020, and indeed has benefited from lockdowns in Italy and around the world, it is rice, a production in which Piedmont, and the Vercelli area in particular, excel:
IT_007	4	More than 50 percent of the national area under rice paddy cultivation, about 115,000 hectares, is located among the provinces of Vercelli (70,000 hectares), Novara (30,000), Biella (4,000) and Alessandria (8,000), with small production also in Cuneo and Turin.
IT_007	5	The curb on imports from foreign countries, and increased consumption in the population forced to stay at home due to quarantine, has accelerated the sales of the rice industry in Italy, with an increase of nearly 41,000 tons (+10%) in the 2019/2020 marketing year compared to the previous one: large retailers have stocked up more, and so have consumers.
IT_007	6	"Although, they clarify from Ente Nazionale Risi, it is impossible to determine the extent: in any case,"" says the president, Paolo Carrà from Vercelli, ""it took a pandemic to c apalize that agriculture is a fundamental sector, because it produces a strategic good and, above all, in compliance with regulations."
IT_007	7	What will 2021 hold in store?
IT_007	8	There are many unknowns and it depends on the evolution of the pandemic.
IT_007	9	But the effects are already being felt, for example for some varieties such as sushi varieties, also grown in the Vercelli area, which is being affected by the blockage of the restaurant channel.
IT_007	10	There was a 1.5 percent increase in gross production in the just concluded marketing year, which stood at 1,502,682 tons of paddy rice nationwide, resulting in an availability of 916,044 tons of milled rice.
IT_007	11	The forecast for the 2020/2021 marketing year is 1,513,000 tons of paddy rice, an increase of 10,400 tons (+0.7 percent).
IT_007	12	The placement (i.e., sale) of milled rice on the Italian market was 441,000 tons, up 10 percent from the previous year.
IT_007	13	"""The 2020 market was a sizzling one,"" Carrà adds, ""Foreign countries preferred to keep their product for domestic consumption, and the lockdown enhanced the placement of Italian and European product."
IT_007	14	The agricultural sector has held up.
IT_007	15	In 2021, we have some loose cannons, for example, the resumption of imports from Pma (the less advanced countries, such as Southeast Asia) and restaurants still standing still, which have led to a slowdown in Tondo sales.
IT_007	16	Good news comes from the agreement signed in December between the EU and the UK, which will allow Italian products (with certified origin) to be exported across the Channel without being burdened with duties.
IT_007	17	The pact includes the 70,000 tons of Italian rice exported to Britain each year.
IT_007	18	A positive 2020 according to Airi, Association of Italian Rice Industries, chaired by Mario Francese of Vercelli.
IT_007	19	"Between February and April, rice consumption increased because of people in lockdown,"" he says; prices were also satisfactory."
IT_007	20	2021?
IT_007	21	The situation is evolving; it is too early to make judgments.
IT_007	22	We are at the final mile for exporting risotto rice to China, but there is not much to get your hopes up: we are talking about a niche market, which will not open up immediately for Italy.
IT_007	23	And it is not in China that the problems of Italian rice will be solved.
IT_007	24	The area's representative cereal has absorbed the covid phase well for Paolo Dellarole, president of Coldiretti Vercelli-Biella, compared, he points out, to other sectors such as animal husbandry, floriculture and agritourism.
IT_007	25	Although the October flood and hail affected the quality of some varieties, and caused damage to some infrastructure.
IT_007	26	It is now hoped that prices will not decrease and that refreshments will be adequate.
IT_007	27	On the other hand, there are those who have experienced negative repercussions from the blockades, such as Quirino Barone, a producer at the Malfatta estate in Ronsecco: The business of the farm store has been affected by travel restrictions.
IT_007	28	Instead there was an acceleration in closing supply contracts: people bought so much rice, staying at home they had time to cook.
IT_007	29	Some varieties have remained stagnant, such as sushi varieties, which have been affected by restaurant closures: it is hoped that in 2021 the situation will normalize.
IT_008	1	Here's why the goal of 30 million electric cars by 2030 is moving away
IT_008	2	First Covid, then the conflict in Ukraine have plunged the automotive industry into a deep crisis that is jeopardizing the European Commission's goal of 30 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2030, outlined well before the current war and all the long-term consequences due to the pandemic.
IT_008	3	That's the view of Giorgio Barbieri, senior partner and North & South Europe Automotive leader at consulting firm Deloitte, who says that today's transition to 'green' mobility is seriously hampered by the new geopolitical scenario that has emerged from the war, which ''is already having major consequences on global finance and on all Industry costs.''
IT_008	4	In particular, Barbieri emphasizes the European industry's heavy dependence on Russian and Ukrainian supplies of aluminum, palladium and neon, essential elements for microchip and semiconductor production.
IT_008	5	But ''from the perspective of the European institutions, the long-term strategy is focused on the electric car as the key to hitting the target of 30 million zero-emission vehicles by 2030.
IT_008	6	Thus, ''for regulators,'' Barbieri notes, ''it is no longer a question of 'when' but of 'how' to achieve these goals.''
IT_008	7	And in this regard, according to Deloitte's senior partner, ''it will be important for institutions to maintain an approach aimed at promoting all 'green' technologies.
IT_008	8	Focusing the legislative framework on environmental performance targets rather than on a specific technology.''
IT_008	9	"In addition, Barbieri adds, ""Europe will need to ensure access to essential raw materials, support investment and production of battery cells by European suppliers, enhance research and innovation programs, ensure the availability of skills, know-how and professionalism throughout the value chain, promote sustainable production of battery cells, and facilitate synergies and consistency with the broader legislative framework."""
IT_008	10	"Barbieri's analysis then focuses on the Italian industry, which, in order to assume ""a distinctive position within the electrical supply chain,"" as well as ""in the acquisition and training of talent and specialized profiles,"" will have to support and focus on the capacity of the fabric of SMEs, in the reconversion of business models and, above all, invest in R&D"
IT_008	11	.
IT_008	12	''Only with growth in technological innovation, in fact, can Italian plants gain competitiveness and maintain a role in the global scenario.''
IT_008	13	Another strategic aspect, concludes the Deloitte manager, ''will concern the ability of private actors and public institutions to work together in outlining a 'national car policy.'''
IT_008	14	Oriented at reconciling the different perspectives ''to exploit synergies, leverage advanced engineering knowledge, create clusters and poles of excellence, and apply 'open innovation' logics to also enhance Italian-made products in the sector.''
IT_011	1	EU stock exchanges, cautious start expected.
IT_011	2	Focus on Btp auctions
IT_011	3	A cautious start is also expected for EU stock markets today, with investors weighing tonight's latest news on Brexit, developments in U.S.-China negotiations and moves from the Federal Reserve.
IT_011	4	Weak stock exchanges in Asia (Nikkei +0.1%).
IT_011	5	Wall Street, on the other hand, closed above parity yesterday.
IT_011	6	"""Investors are enticed to take risks because they believe they have the central bankers behind them,"" says Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management."
IT_011	7	The Dow Jones rose fractionally by 0.03 percent, the S&P 500 by 0.35 percent and the Nasdaq Composite by 0.69 percent.
IT_011	8	In recent hours, EU leaders in the night agreed to postpone Brexit until Oct. 31 to allow the British prime minister, Theresa May, more time to try to convince Parliament to approve the country's agreement to leave the EU.
IT_011	9	As for the Fed, the minutes of the last March meeting released last night with European markets closed showed that, in light of increased economic risks, the majority of the U.S. central bank's members lean toward leaving rates unchanged for this year (2.25-2.5 percent), although some advisors opened to hikes by criticizing Chairman Jerome Powell's cautiousness.
IT_011	10	"The market's expected cautiousness is related to ""a more restrictive interpretation of the Fed's latest minutes than expected because they seem to offer more questions than answers,"" explains Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at Cmc Markets, with some Fomc members leaving room for possible rate hikes later this year should the economy improve."
IT_011	11	While also at its meeting yesterday, the ECB confirmed the accommodative approach while not addressing the question of the instruments to be used after the third LTRO was announced in March (but without giving details).
IT_011	12	Meanwhile, the U.S. and China have agreed on an enforcement mechanism for their potential trade deal, said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, hinting that one of the main obstacles to the deal has been overcome.
IT_011	13	In the macro, Germany's final consumer price index increased 0.4 percent month-on-month and rose 1.3 percent year-on-year in March, in line with the preliminary reading and consensus.
IT_011	14	Then reported from the U.S. at 2:30 p.m. are the weekly claims for unemployment benefits.
IT_011	15	And spring meetings organized by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will be held in Washington.
IT_011	16	Finally, inflation in China accelerated to 2.3 percent y/y in March from 1.5 percent in February.
IT_011	17	Same for producer prices, which rose 0.4 percent y/y from +0.1 percent in the previous month.
IT_011	18	On the currency front, the pound gained ground against the dollar during the Asian session in the wake of the latest developments on Brexit.
IT_011	19	Going into detail on the major crosses, the euro/usd is traveling just below 1.13 at 1.1279, unchanged from yesterday's close, the dollar/yen is just above 111 at 111.071, and the pound-dollar exchange rate is trading around 1.31.
IT_011	20	Oil prices are trading lower, down about 0.5 percent, and the price of gold is trading at $1,307 an ounce.
IT_011	21	Also on Italy's agenda this morning are auctions of BTPs at 2022, 2016, and 2035 for a total of 7.75 billion euros, while the Btp-Bund spread restarts from 258 basis points at yesterday's close.
IT_011	22	In Piazza Affari to follow banking, which contrasted yesterday.
IT_011	23	Focus then always on industrialists, who remain awaiting developments on the tariff issue front.
IT_011	24	Watch out also that before the stock market opened it announced the launch of Italy's first asset management boutique that is already starting with a rich endowment of 1 billion euros.
IT_012	1	After the G7 in Biarritz, the point on the (alleged) world recession
IT_012	2	Macron sums up the G7 in Biarritz.
IT_012	3	For years the G7 has been going around in circles: there is always some leader who takes the summit from the terrain of confrontation to the terrain of confrontation.
IT_012	4	Since 2017, that is, since he entered the White House and thus also the club of those who lead the world's seven most industrialized countries, that leader has been Donald Trump.
IT_012	5	"There is no reason to think that he will behave any differently in Biarritz, quite the contrary: long before leaving for the weekend of the 2019 edition summit beginning Saturday 24, closing today with the classic press conference of the host head of state or government, and then, this year, Emmanuel Macron warned his ""colleagues"" that he is very ready, for example, to drop the bombshell on Europe as well."
IT_012	6	It is a spectrum that stirs at regular intervals.
IT_012	7	"This time he raised the tone further: ""Dealing with the EU is difficult, but we hold all the cards and they will give me whatever I want-just tax their cars."""
IT_012	8	Macron, who will publicly summarize the weekend of meetings this morning, will have his hands full demanding attention for the issue he would have liked to have been at the center of the proceedings.
IT_012	9	"For that matter, even on ""fighting inequality"" Trump has his own way of thinking."
IT_012	10	And to that of European sovereignists.
IT_012	11	Who among the Greats, however, are not there (not yet?).
IT_012	12	The dual key to understanding the U.S. economy.
IT_012	13	We, in Europe, worried about the sirens sounding the recession alarm louder and louder.
IT_012	14	They, in the U.S., who are not worried at all.
IT_012	15	"Or so they say from the White House, ""We are doing better than any country or area in the world, our consumers are very strong."""
IT_012	16	Yeah, but for how long?
IT_012	17	Donald Trump-who uttered the above sentence a few days ago, and precisely to reassure markets that so sure of America's immunity to crisis are not-some fear must actually have it.
IT_012	18	Otherwise, he would not continue to flog the Fed to go down with the hatchet on rates, nor would he be analyzing the possibility of a tax cut for the middle class (rate lower than 10 percent, according to the president's economic adviser).
IT_012	19	"A clear message, the latter, to those ""very strong consumers,"" of course, and who nevertheless are beginning it seems to cultivate some doubts and thus pull the brake."
IT_012	20	Quite strongly, too, according to measurements from the University of Michigan, whose preliminary estimate sees the confidence index plummeting from 98.4 points in July to 92.1 in August.
IT_012	21	Analysts, who had expected a limited decline to 97.7, are expecting the final figure today.
IT_012	22	Knowing that, usually, it is not the Ann Arbor University that is wrong.
IT_012	23	The recession that scares Europe.
IT_012	24	The Bundesbank used the conditional tense.
IT_012	25	"But if the central institute says the German economy ""could"" experience a new GDP contraction after the -0.1 percent contraction in the second quarter, those who are not obliged to mince their words inevitably translate the hypothesis into near certainty."
IT_012	26	And so yes, the probability is very high that when the July-September data come in, Germany will also have to declare itself in a state of technical recession.
IT_012	27	How serious, if any, and whether temporary or not, will help to understand today Destatis: coming out, from the Federal Statistical Office, is the bulletin with the detailed analysis of the situation that led to the -0.1 percent in the April-June period.
IT_012	28	Also keep an eye on the Insee offices in Paris: as we await details on second-quarter GDP on Thursday 29, the statistics of the day in France will range from investment in industry to the climate of confidence in the country.
IT_012	29	Needless to mention what the predictions are.
IT_012	30	The climate of (un)trust between people and businesses in Italy.
IT_012	31	And then, of course, there is us.
IT_012	32	"The ""beautiful year"" promised by Giuseppe Conte had crashed on non-growth data even before the European elections and subsequent reversal in the power relations between the League and the Fifteen."
IT_012	33	"Ferragosto was joined by the much-announced government crisis, Matteo Salvini's ""no-confidence no-confidence"" to the yellow-green executive, the premier's resignation, and cross-party wizardry between the party of the vote and the platoon of those who fear the ballot box."
IT_012	34	There would also be an economic maneuver, to be done, and a VAT increase to be averted.
IT_012	35	It would be strange if the Consumer and Business Confidence Index, coming from Istat today, did not function as a mirror.
IT_020	1	Gozi (Pd) will be an adviser to Macron.
IT_020	2	League and M5S furious:
IT_020	3	"""High Treason"""
IT_020	4	If on Tav, flat tax, etc., the governing majority is as divided as ever, on one thing the League and Five Star Movement agree:
IT_020	5	the very harsh condemnation of Sandro Gozi , the Democratic Party member who recently became an adviser to Macron .
IT_020	6	"Gozi, in fact, served as undersecretary for European Affairs in the Renzi and Gentiloni governments , and then ran for the European elections on the ""Renaissance"" list of La République En Marche of the transalpine president ."
IT_020	7	"Even then Gozi got into a storm over his decision, but he defended himself by calling himself a "" transnational candidate The wrath of the League and M5S."
IT_020	8	"Among Gozi's harshest protesters is certainly Stefano Buffagni , undersecretary of the Ministry of Regional Affairs and Autonomies: ""Reading about a former member of the Italian government (under Renzi) being appointed to the government of another country, France, is something truly vomitous and worrying!"
IT_020	9	""", Buffagni wrote in a Facebook post ."
IT_020	10	"Who then presses on, ""The question then arises: who was Gozi working for then?"
IT_020	11	Did he really represent Italy's interests or was he playing on other fields for other countries?
IT_020	12	Isn't there a risk of high treason against the personality of the Italian state?
IT_020	13	"Then we wonder why Italy has never been respected over the years!!!"""
IT_020	14	"Salvini, however, also took a position on the matter: ""Gozi, former undersecretary for European affairs under Renzi and Gentiloni, with Macron's blessing is now appointed, same role, in the French government!!!"
IT_020	15	"Imagine whose interests this character was serving when he was in the Italian government ... Crazy, this is the PD!"""
IT_020	16	, thundered the League leader.
IT_020	17	Gozi's retort.
IT_020	18	"At this point Gozi entrusted his retort to the interior minister to Twitter: ""I read that Matteo Salvini wonders how I protected national interests when I was in government."
IT_020	19	Dear Salvini, whenever you want we will confront each other, deeds and documents in hand, to see who between you and me has looked after the interests of our country more and better.
IT_020	20	"Shall we do this?"""
IT_020	21	"Gozi, let's remember, is waiting for the Brexit procedure to free up the seats of British MEPs so that he can take over as ""reserve."""
IT_020	22	In the meantime, the former Pd undersecretary may occupy his time as European policy adviser to French President Macron.
IT_020	23	Gozi's appointment is expected to be made official in the coming days.
IT_023	1	Coronavirus, from cocaine to cow feces: here are the most bizarre alleged cures around the world
IT_023	2	From bread dipped in wine to cloves, the remedies suggested by `300 doctors to protect themselves from the Black Death that tore Europe apart appear tragic in their naiveté today.
IT_023	3	How absurd many beliefs, which still endure, related to traditional Chinese or sub-Saharan medicine may seem.
IT_023	4	In the face of a new, lethal and as yet untreatable enemy such as Covid-19, magical thinking resurfaces powerfully even in the most modern and secularized societies.
IT_023	5	So much so that there are also political power players among those advocating the most absurd (and, of course, ineffective) therapies suggested these days to protect against the coronavirus.
IT_023	6	COCAINE In France, the Ministry of Health was forced to specify on its social channels that cocaine does not kill coronavirus; rather, it is an addictive drug, causes serious side effects and is harmful to people's health.
IT_023	7	Popularizing this curious theory were some Twitter accounts that posted fake news screenshots of scientists' shock at the discovery, which would put the substance back on pharmacy shelves (it was used as a painkiller and local anesthetic in the late 19th century, only to be ousted by novocaine in the `900s).
IT_023	8	We do not know how far beyond the Alps the demand for the narcotic has increased in recent weeks because of its alleged therapeutic virtues.
IT_023	9	Surely it's better to convince yourself of the beneficial properties of garlic, which-according to another hoax that's raging online-would also cure Covid-19: it's just as ineffective but does less harm and, most importantly, is much cheaper.
IT_023	10	VODKA AND OTHER ALCOHOLICS Being able to turn a vice into therapy seems too good to be true.
IT_023	11	But unfortunately, not even vodka is able to kill the virus, as Belarus' strongman Alexander Lukashenko suggested to citizens.
IT_023	12	Europe's last dictatorship is one of the nations that has taken the least stringent measures in the face of the epidemic and has recorded few cases and no deaths, at least officially.
IT_023	13	For teetotalers, Lukashenko's advice is a nice sauna, giacche, according to his scientific advisers, the virus would not withstand a temperature of 60 degrees, which is still more than the 27 sufficient to crush Covid-19 according to a wretched chain letter that was circulating not long ago on Italians' cell phones.
IT_023	14	Instead, the belief, which has spread in some areas of Iran, that drinking alcohol cures disease is having tragic effects.
IT_023	15	Since the sale of such drinks is prohibited in the Islamic Republic, many people have resorted to clandestinely manufactured concoctions containing methanol, which can cause blindness and death.
IT_023	16	The victims of this deadly belief number at least 300.
IT_023	17	In vain were the reminders of the authorities, who, having reacted late to the epidemic, are viewed with increasing distrust by the population.
IT_023	18	CANDEGGINA Instead, it is mainly in the United States that the idea that drinking bleach cures coronavirus has spread, due to another message that has gone viral on Twitter thanks to the usual scoundrels.
IT_023	19	Evidently there are those who believe that what disinfects surfaces can also be beneficial to the body.
IT_023	20	That ingesting toxic chemicals does anything but good should be a truism but that is not the case if the University of Virginia's Poison Control Center was forced to clarify it.
IT_023	21	Even more widespread, but far less dangerous, is the hoax that all it takes to kill Covid-19 is gargling with warm salt water and vinegar, which against a normal sore throat at least does something.
IT_023	22	BOVINE EXCREMENTS In India the cow is considered a sacred animal by the Hindu majority, so much so that in some religious ceremonies worshippers have urine and feces from the cow poured on them to show their devotion to it.
IT_023	23	Many also believe that ungulate droppings are a panacea.
IT_023	24	And so in early March the small nationalist Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha party held parties in New Delhi and other cities during which participants drank cow urine to protect themselves from the coronavirus.
IT_023	25	Equally effective would be a bath in the animal's excrement.
IT_023	26	Even an MP from the ruling party, Narendra Modi's BJP, has publicly extolled the therapeutic properties of bovine bodily waste.
IT_023	27	This is Suman Haripriya, elected to the Assam Assembly, whose statements have drawn strong criticism from the scientific community.
IT_023	28	In a country where some extreme nationalists are even convinced that India even in ancient times had airplanes and stem cell research, however, this is evidently only the tip of the iceberg.

IT_024	2	Daniela Rossetti, 64, Maiolati Spontini, works in transportation administration.
IT_024	3	"""In this 'strange' time, I often wonder how much fault do I have in all this, too?"
IT_024	4	I have my faults because I do not appreciate being incarcerated even though my desire for freedom clashes with my fear of harming others.
IT_024	5	Altruism?
IT_024	6	Macché!
IT_024	7	"Just the knowledge that if I (and I hope others) am not careful, we will find ourselves restricting even more, and it is not known for how long and how, everyone's freedom including my own pawing."""
IT_024	8	"""Freedom to do what?"
IT_024	9	All the even futile things I used to do.
IT_024	10	Of course I don't have the prospect of saving or changing the world.
IT_024	11	That should be the prerogative of the powerful, but it seems to me that aside from good faith, which is denied to no one, one must agree that there is a lot of confusion among them as well.
IT_024	12	Do they want the people to behave?
IT_024	13	But how many different messages we get even from those who should be responsible when they speak.
IT_024	14	Should we get the vaccine?
IT_024	15	How?
IT_024	16	When?
IT_024	17	"Where and why?"""
IT_024	18	"""Don't give us opposing versions we are already confused in our own right and maybe tell us we can do it, but not within two or three years otherwise we will be angry."
IT_024	19	You must (we must) do well but quickly and then we don't always blame others.
IT_024	20	School?
IT_024	21	It is either too early or too late.
IT_024	22	I hope this virus will go away because it takes courage or unconsciousness to use our bodies to live.
IT_024	23	"One thing I feel like saying to some politicians, like Renzi for example, I feel like associating him, his party I mean, with the virus, small and deadly, if they were so intransigent also toward everything that corrupts society, economy and nature other than Greta."""
IT_024	24	"""But Conte should not let it sink in, he has begun the work carry his ideas through to the end and take responsibility in this strange time together with his ministers and collaborators otherwise it will always be his fault anyway."
IT_024	25	Now we no longer talk about the immigrant onslaught, now we have to drive out the intruder who wants to enter us in order to survive.
IT_024	26	It is easier to let inert people drown who want to save themselves from wars and starvation, but it is more complicated to save themselves from a tiny, deadly being.
IT_024	27	But maybe that will teach us to defend ourselves better in the future, I say maybe, because if wars haven't taught us more than that, I wouldn't want epidemics to barely tickle our minds either.
IT_024	28	Good luck in the new year and best wishes to all.

IT_031	1	Presented at ECTRIMS the global PROMS initiative to bring the perspective of people with MS increasingly to the forefront of research, development of new therapies, and in the design of health care systems
IT_031	2	The European Charcot Foundation together with the MS International Federation (MSIF) and the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Association, AISM, presented a new global initiative at the European congress dedicated to multiple sclerosis (Ectrims) to increasingly value people's perspective in multiple sclerosis (MS) research and health care.
IT_031	3	The project is called PROMS-an acronym for 'Patient Reported Outcomes for MS'-and AISM will have the role of 'Lead Agency,' tasked with promoting and coordinating this global initiative on behalf of MSIF.The global initiative will bring together the international MS community, people with multiple sclerosis, health care professionals and researchers, industry, and many other stakeholders, with the goal of promoting science that increasingly gives substance to the patient perspective, bringing the experiences of people with MS into scientific research, trials for the development of new therapies, and health systems development.
IT_031	4	What are Patient Reported Outcomes.
IT_031	5	'Patient reported outcomes (PROs) are scientific tools that reflect the perspective and experience of people with MS in relation to their treatment or disease condition, giving value and quality to the information that comes from the people themselves.People with MS are the main experts on 'their' disease: they know what it is like to live with it, they measure the impact that treatments have on their lives, they are clear about what the main effects of medications or rehabilitation techniques should be on their quality of life.
IT_031	6	In order for their voice on these issues to take on weight in scientific and health policy processes, and for it to be shared by all actors in the various fields, it must be scientifically qualified (Science of patients input).
IT_031	7	The PROMS initiative will ensure informed, quality participation of people with MS in research and health care decision-making about their treatments and benefits, focusing on the topics that matter most to them, such as symptom management and other aspects of daily life with multiple sclerosis.
IT_031	8	A strategic research agenda and a shared 'road map' among all stakeholders are therefore the right way to develop the full potential of PROs, to enable their adoption in clinical practice and in the decision-making processes of regulatory bodies.The PROMS initiative, launched today, will take a comprehensive approach to address this challenge.
IT_031	9	It will promote a set of standardized PROs for use in therapy development and health care, and promote research to develop new PROs to meet the needs of all stakeholders.Involving people with multiple sclerosis in governance is crucial to achieving the mission of the initiative, as well as measuring the impact of the initiative against what matters most to people with MS.
IT_031	10	"Professor Giancarlo Comi , president of the European Charcot Foundation, said, ""This global initiative aims to value the 'voice of the patient' with a multistakeholder approach."
IT_031	11	"We need shared and validated PROs for use in both experimental medicine and clinical care."""
IT_031	12	"Peer Baneke , CEO of MSIF, said, ""This exciting initiative will transform the future of research and the clinic."
IT_031	13	"It gives the global MSIF movement a unique opportunity to ensure that the voices of people living with MS around the world are at the forefront of MS research, studies, and health care planning. ""Professor Mario Alberto Battaglia , president of the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (IMF), said, ""The global MS movement will play a key role in implementing a model for the systematic involvement of people with MS in research and health care."
IT_031	14	"International experience in applying multi-stakeholder initiative models, on PROs, in MS research and health care, has led AISM and its Foundation to be the lead agency for the PROMS initiative."""

IT_040	7	China has shut down the Shanghai laboratory that first isolated and developed the genome sequence of the new coronavirus.
IT_040	8	The Public Health Center laboratory where the researchers coordinated by Professor Zhang Yongzhen were working was shut down for an unspecified correction on Jan. 12, in the aftermath of the online publication of their discovery-a strange way to reward a disclosure that has helped the development of diagnostic kits by several companies around the world.
IT_040	9	shangai public health center 1.
IT_040	10	The lab's closure, ordered by the Shanghai Health Commission, appears to be because the lab published data before it was licensed, reconstructs the South China Morning Post.
IT_040	11	The researchers would be punished for acting unilaterally.

IT_040	15	Zhang and his team would, in short, have interfered with the long time politics, at first reluctant to create alarm around the virus.
IT_040	16	His lab had reported the outcome of his research to the authorities at the National Health Commission the same day it was achieved: on Jan. 5, the Hong Kong newspaper points out.
IT_040	17	In the statement, the professor also recommended virus control and prevention measures to be taken immediately in public places.
IT_040	18	This was two days before Beijing's official announcement about the link between the mysterious Wuhan pneumonia cases and a new coronavirus, when human-to-human contagion was still being questioned.

IT_040	20	Zhang's researchers, receiving no feedback from authorities, six days later, on Jan. 11, disclosed their findings on a number of online scientific platforms.

IT_040	23	Now that the emergency is global and China has passed the peak of the infections, Professor Zhang and his team hoped to get back to work.
IT_040	24	It doesn't.
IT_040	25	They sent four requests for permission to reopen the lab, all of which went unanswered reports the Hong Kong newspaper citing a source close to the researchers .
IT_040	26	The shutdown has had a great impact on scientists and their research at the very time when there should be a race against time to find remedies against the virus.
IT_049	1	"Pm ""pardoning"" Casarini & Co. but investigating the Yellow Flames"
IT_049	2	In fact, investigators, as revealed by Il Fatto Quotidiano , may set their eyes on the work of the Guardia di Finanza .
IT_049	3	Therefore, inside the offices of the Agrigento prosecutor's office , which is in charge of the investigation, are very excited hours.
IT_049	4	The Mare Jonio case, as it is known, arose last March, almost a year ago.
IT_049	5	After a relatively quiet period on the immigration front, a new NGO ship with 49 migrants on board has reappeared off Lampedusa.
IT_049	6	The vessel was indeed the Mare Jonio, belonging to the Italian NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans.
IT_049	7	The intent of the organization's members was to challenge for the first time the security decree passed in the previous October, which was especially wanted by then Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.
IT_049	8	That is why the crew of the Mare Jonio failed to comply with the halt imposed by the Guardia di Finanza on the ship, which entered Italian waters before being seized and driven to the port of Lampedusa.
IT_049	9	The investigation by the Agrigento prosecutor's office, until yesterday, centered on this episode, namely the forcing of the blockade implemented by Casarini and Marrone.
IT_049	10	Then, as previously written in the past few hours, magistrates of the Sicilian prosecutor's office requested that the case be closed precisely against the two suspects.
IT_049	11	According to investigators, therefore, Casarini and Marrone are not prosecutable for the crimes for which they were charged, namely aiding and abetting illegal immigration and failing to comply with an order given by a military vessel.
IT_049	12	Indeed, as mentioned earlier, magistrates in Agrigento may open a file on the order given by the Guardia di Finanza.
IT_049	13	In particular, what caught the attention of investigators was a part of the wiretaps related to the dialogue between crew of the Mare Jonio and the patrol boat Apruzzi of the Yellow Flames.
IT_049	14	From the military vehicle, in enjoining the stop of the NGO ship, reference would be made twice to a ban on entry into waters under Italian jurisdiction imposed by 'judicial authority.
IT_049	15	However, such a ban was never enacted, nor could it have been since the judicial authority does not have the power to impose it.
IT_049	16	Hence the possible charges leveled against the Guardia di Finanza, with the halt ordered by the Apruzzi patrol boat that could, according to investigators, set up a crime.
IT_049	17	With financiers who, at this point, could themselves become suspects after Casarini and Marrone's request for dismissal.
IT_049	18	Also because, according to rumors also reported in Il Fatto Quotidiano, according to Sicilian magistrates at that specific time there were no alternative routes to landing in Italy.
IT_049	19	In fact, among the reasons that led the Agrigento prosecutor's office to request that the two from Mediterranea be dismissed was that it was impossible to take the migrants to Libya , as it was not considered a safe port, as well as Tunisia , since the latter country does not have a Sar zone.
IT_049	20	The investigation therefore is set to continue.
IT_052	1	Escaped together from Nigeria, migrant couple marry in Puglia: wedding witness is employer
IT_052	2	When they arrived in Italy they were already together:
IT_052	3	Monsurat Ganiyu and Evans Omeiop were engaged when they fled Nigeria, hand in hand, reluctantly giving up their dream of starting a family in their homeland.
IT_052	4	That dream, however, they never set it aside, and they finally succeeded in achieving it.
IT_052	5	Joining them in marriage in a civil ceremony-translated into Pidgin English by a language mediator-was the mayor of San Pancrazio Salentino, Salvatore Ripa.
IT_052	6	Monsurat and Evans have lived in the town in the province of Brindisi since 2017, having arrived there from Termoli thanks to the Sprar project.
IT_052	7	"""And they are our finest example of integration in the territory,"" says Anna Franza now, coordinator of the Siproimi reception center, whose managing body is Arci - Brindisi Territorial Committee."
IT_052	8	They have a lot to talk about, the newlyweds: she is almost 30, he is 26, and they already have two girls born in Italy, Vittoria and Giulia.
IT_052	9	They were with mom and dad for the ceremony held at the town hall, all four dressed in white.
IT_052	10	Adding beauty to the story is a detail of no small importance.
IT_052	11	Evans' best man is his employer, a Sampancrazio man who believed in him: because Evans was a blacksmith in Nigeria, and when he left with Monsurat--following threats, and surrounded by poverty--thanks to the Sprar project he had started a paid internship in a San Pancrazio company.
IT_052	12	"After his six-month probation, he was hired: ""Good, respectful, polite, and smart,"" they say of him."
IT_052	13	His wife, on the other hand, took certified cooking classes, and as a witness she wanted a friend she met in San Pancrazio itself.
IT_052	14	"""They make themselves well liked by everyone,"" they continue from the Sprar."
IT_052	15	Both have learned Italian, a language that is also their own for their two little girls, who were born in Italy, although for the state they are not its citizens.
IT_052	16	The married couple and their daughters left the Sprar a few months ago because they are now fully autonomous.
IT_052	17	There is Covid-19, of course, but their dream has now come true.
IT_052	18	"""The spirit of welcome that helped to bring about the right serenity to be able to plan such an important day as a wedding, even in such a special period, is a tangible and evident sign of social integration and growth for everyone,"" comments the head of Arci Brindisi, Vincenzo Catamo. ""To think that we have minimally contributed to writing a beautiful page of love and hope between these two boys more than 4,000 kilometers away from their birthplace is for us a source of enormous satisfaction and contentment."
IT_052	19	And despite the fact that there were very few people at the ceremony, their wedding was a sliver of beauty, a rare commodity in these dark times.
IT_052	20	"Because love, they conclude from the Sprar project, ""transcends all borders and conflicts."""

IT_066	15	"""I was not going to spread panic on the unified networks on Sunday, February 22."
IT_066	16	"So we have become the world's anointers."""
IT_066	17	But the emergency is unfortunately real.
IT_066	18	"""It could be handled without any showmanship."
IT_066	19	Our numbers come from the decision to do the blanket testing, unlike other countries.
IT_066	20	The truth is that the contagion was already everywhere, only others were careful not to tell, starting with the U.S.
IT_066	21	"And so now CNN can make maps by which it looks like the virus has broken out in Italy and not in China."""
IT_066	22	Have the others been smarter?

IT_066	29	By choice?
IT_066	30	"""Yes, they felt they were on the ropes."
IT_066	31	Emphasizing this emergency was a way to get out of the corner.
IT_066	32	And the premier also attacked Lombardy's health care, blaming doctors in Codogno.
IT_066	33	"It is not done."""
IT_066	34	She called him Cadornicchio for days.

IT_066	39	But the opposition, you in the lead, did not give the impression of being particularly responsible at this unprecedented stage.
IT_066	40	And now the polls show the League declining.
IT_066	41	"""Well, I never looked at the polls."
IT_066	42	We actually have always voiced focused criticism and made concrete proposals.
IT_066	43	"And Conte is part of the problem."""
IT_066	44	But it is the government that decides, the Head of State cautioned.
IT_066	45	"""We agree."
IT_066	46	But it is like with judges' rulings: you respect them, but you can also criticize them.
IT_066	47	And the 7.5 billion allocated is nothing in the face of this catastrophe.

IT_066	55	Does Salvini with the cutting board seem to you to be posing as a statesman?
IT_066	56	"""He wanted to reassure everyone: 'Come to Trentino, there are beautiful places, good food.'"
IT_066	57	"It was an ad against the collapse of reservations."""
IT_066	58	In an out-of-the-ordinary situation, wouldn't less slogans on social media be needed?

IT_088	1	Climate, Greenpeace:
IT_088	2	"""We are not prepared for what will happen, we need a real ecological transition."""
IT_088	3	Today experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Ipcc) delivered the most comprehensive climate impacts assessment report ever to governments around the world.
IT_088	4	Focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, the report details how severe the consequences of the climate crisis already are, with widespread loss and damage to people and ecosystems around the world, set to worsen as global temperatures rise.
IT_088	5	"""It is a harsh analysis, but we need to face the facts honestly if we are to find solutions that are up to the challenge ahead."
IT_088	6	We must act faster and more courageously, at all levels, and leave no one behind.
IT_088	7	The rights and needs of the most vulnerable communities must be placed at the center of climate action.
IT_088	8	"Now is the time to act and stand united,"" says Kaisa Kosonen of Greenpeace Nordic."
IT_088	9	Compared with the last Ipcc assessment, the new report warns that the risks of the climate crisis are manifesting faster and are likely to become more severe sooner than expected.
IT_088	10	According to the Ipcc, mortality from floods, droughts and storms has been 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions than in regions with lower vulnerability over the past decade.
IT_088	11	The report also recognizes the crucial importance of addressing the interconnected climate and ecological crises together.
IT_088	12	Only by protecting and restoring ecosystems can we strengthen their resilience to global warming, on which the well-being of humanity depends.
IT_088	13	"""Our atmosphere today is on steroids, doped with fossil fuels."
IT_088	14	"This is already leading to stronger, longer and more intense extreme weather events.""- @WMO SG Petteri Taalas on today's release of the 's latest - IPCC (@IPCC_CH) February 28, 2022 ""This report is a serious warning that flies in the face of the ecological fiction in vogue in Italy."
IT_088	15	Renewables are stalled, and people continue to focus on fossil gas, which is now the main source of emissions, or even speculate on reigniting coal-fired power plants.
IT_088	16	A trap that today guarantees extra profits for energy giants like Eni, and a future full of danger for all of us.
IT_088	17	We must abandon all investment in fossil fuels now and protect 30 percent of land and marine ecosystems by 2030.
IT_088	18	"Acting now is vital because extreme weather events are already impacting our territory as well, as the terrible drought of recent months shows, putting Italian agriculture at risk,"" says Alessandro Giannì, campaigns director at Greenpeace Italy."
IT_088	19	Whether world leaders like it or not, this report will define future climate policies.
IT_088	20	Last year, at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow (Cop26), governments admitted they were not doing enough to limit warming to within the 1.5°C safe threshold set by the Paris Agreement, agreeing to revise national emission reduction targets by the end of 2022.
IT_088	21	At the upcoming climate summit (Cop27) in Egypt at the end of the year, governments will be called upon to address the widening gap between adaptation measures, loss and damage, and the deep injustices caused by the climate crisis, which the IPCC highlighted in the report presented today.
IT_091	1	Trani, Pyramid dispute: start of the tug-of-war, concern for employees
IT_091	2	The labor and union tug-of-war has officially begun, with all the inconveniences already brought about by the eight-hour lockout implemented, since dawn yesterday, by all the workers at the Italian Commercial Pyramid Spa, the Megamark Group's logistics platform, which the large Tranese distribution company intends to outsource.
IT_091	3	Pyramid employs 100 people, but 46 of them were affected last Sept. 3 by a layoff letter after the company, on Aug. 21, announced the initiation of staff reduction proceedings under the law.
IT_091	4	"Initially, he had asked them to resign,"" Filcams Cgil provincial secretary Antonio Miccoli points out, ""in order to be taken over by the third party contracted to provide the service."
IT_091	5	Then, in the face of the refusal of the unions and workers to resign, came the decision to fire them by specifically stating the names and surnames of the 46 workers destined to go home and thus creating upset and divisions among them.
IT_091	6	Divisions that on the ground, however, were not seen since, again according to the Filcams secretary, everyone joined the strike, including workers not affected by the layoff.
IT_091	7	So much so that today (yesterday, ed.) only the director entered the logistics platform headquarters, but none of the workers, who showed unity and solidarity among themselves.
IT_091	8	The disruptions soon manifested themselves to the extent that 50 trucks were stranded at the edge of the affected area, including 30 that were supposed to unload goods and 20 that were supposed to load them.
IT_091	9	The unions, moreover, do not accept the fact that workers with an average age of 55--still too young to retire but already too old, work-wise, to find other employment--are suddenly leaving the scene because of a business choice that Miccoli calls inexplicable.
IT_091	10	Megamark is far from a company in crisis, and such a choice probably travels in the direction of producing additional profits.
IT_091	11	But what is peculiar is that while the company, through its foundation, proclaims itself in deed to be close to social and cultural outreach, it also resorts to socially and culturally censorious means.
IT_091	12	The 46 workers are mainly from Trani, Bisceglie and Molfetta: thus, the ongoing protest affects many families in the Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani and is likely to amplify in a precise and unpredictable manner.
IT_091	13	"The unions have proclaimed another eight hours of strike action at a date yet to be determined and, in the meantime, they let it be known that the company has not yet formally responded to their solicitations and, therefore, no table has yet been convened to discuss the merits of the sensitive issue: If there is a productivity problem, the union will not back down,"" Miccoli says, ""and we are ready to discuss it, but it is too convenient to choose the road of layoffs."
IT_101	1	And now Matera promotes the idea of Europe
IT_101	2	Europe and culture a combination that, all the more so at this moment in history, should be combined to the best advantage.
IT_101	3	And throughout this 2019 just Matera European Capital of Culture, in parallel with the lovely Plovdiv in Bulgaria, illuminate in this sense all of Europe spreading the beam of light of culture around the world.
IT_101	4	To understand how fundamental the cultural sector is in the project desired by founding fathers of the caliber of Altiero Spinelli in his veins flowed Apulian blood being the grandson of Alexander born in Barletta and supported by Emilio Colombo from Potenza, former president of the European Parliament, it is good to know that it is possible to read at the entrance of the Acropolis in Athens a phrase as significant as it is challenging Europe starts here or Europe begins here.
IT_101	5	A fitting tribute to the European City of Culture initiative launched on June 13, 1985, by the Council of Ministers on the initiative of then Minister of Culture in the Greek government Melina Merkouri.
IT_101	6	After all, it is well established that culture is the track along which the European Union train continues to make sure that the more than 500 million citizens inhabiting the current 27 or 28 member states (Brexit permitting) travel in a community that, nonetheless, smells of hope and culture.
IT_101	7	A heritage in which Italy excels and stretches from Sweden to Malta via Lithuania to Poland.
IT_101	8	It is worth pointing out that the culture of peace is the main pivot on which the European project has been consolidated and pursues its directions.
IT_101	9	European Parliament and European Commission, together with all other institutions, promote and support culture in Europe.
IT_101	10	This is a point of emphasis that also fits well in the workplace when we consider that culture, as a particular sector, creates and provides jobs, promoting economic growth.
IT_101	11	And so, it is precisely from Matera that reflection begins with regard to the need to optimize all existing cultural resources in the European territory in order to ensure that the integration and cohesion of our society is fostered.
IT_101	12	The legal basis governing cultural facts is enshrined in Article 151 of the Treaty in which it is well specified that respect for cultural diversity and national identities cannot be disregarded.
IT_101	13	In addition, the role of the regions of the European Union as an important forum for cultural cooperation is highlighted by pointing out that paragraph 4, in identifying the specificities of the culture sector, emphasizes its ability to foster creativity and innovation.
IT_101	14	After all, the very President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, reminded us well yesterday in Matera, culture constitutes the connective tissue of European civilization the one that reinforces the backbone of a great area of peace for more than 70 years rewarded with the Nobel Prize.
IT_101	15	Matera, for all that, distinguish itself by sowing the seeds of a European literacy action in order to make all Europeans aware citizens and voters not only for the upcoming European elections in May.
IT_102	1	Tax havens, the EU's black list now has 15 countries (including the UAE).
IT_102	2	Nothing done on the web tax
IT_102	3	European blacklist of tax havens rises to 15.
IT_102	4	"EU finance ministers in Brussels today updated the blacklist of ""uncooperative tax jurisdictions,"" or tax havens, based on a process of analysis and dialogue with the third countries involved, led by the European Commission."
IT_102	5	In addition to the 5 jurisdictions already in place (American Samoa, Guam, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S. Virgin Islands), the revised EU list of noncooperative jurisdictions now includes 10 more: Aruba, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Dominica, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Vanuatu.
IT_102	6	These jurisdictions, which were on the so-called gray list, did not implement their commitments to the EU within the agreed deadline.
IT_102	7	Another 34 countries will continue to be monitored on the gray list in 2019.
IT_102	8	"""Today we completed our first comprehensive review of the EU list of noncooperative jurisdictions."
IT_102	9	"Since it was first adopted in late 2017, the list has proven its worth in cooperatively advancing the EU's agenda of improving global tax practices, combating tax avoidance, and enhancing good governance and transparency: more than 30 jurisdictions have already delivered commitments to pass tax reforms,"" said Eugen Teodorovici, finance minister of Romania and Ecofin's rotating chair."
IT_102	10	"""The EU list of tax havens is a true European success story: it has had a resounding effect on tax transparency and fairness around the world,"" stressed Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for economic and financial affairs."
IT_102	11	"""Through this process, dozens of the countries have abolished harmful tax regimes and aligned with international standards on transparency and fair taxation."""
IT_102	12	"While, Moscovici concluded, ""countries that have not met their commitments have been blacklisted and will have to face the consequences that this entails."""
IT_102	13	"This morning, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, responding to reporters upon his arrival at the Ecofin meeting this morning in Brussels, explained why Italy, along with Estonia, opposes the inclusion of the United Arab Emirates on the EU's ""blacklist."""
IT_102	14	"""This is not a veto, but having expressed an opinion that the UAE has already submitted to the Commission the new legislation they need to pass, which is fully compliant with what is being requested."""
IT_102	15	"In short, the minister continued, ""it's a problem only of timing: our proposal was that you wait, that you allow these additional times, as has been done for other countries."
IT_102	16	"But in any case,"" he added, ""everything will be resolved as soon as this legislation is passed, and so the Emirates if they get on the list today will get off it soon after."
IT_102	17	"""Our opinion remains, but of course,"" Tria concluded, ""we will also take into account the opinion of others in search of a positive solution."
IT_102	18	Ecofin, on the other hand, failed to reach unanimity on the green light for a single EU-wide web tax.
IT_102	19	"""On the web tax we have come to an agreement in principle,"" but due to the opposition of some states ""it was decided to wait for the decision at the OECD level,"" Teodorovici announced, at the press conference at the end of the Ecofin adding ""our idea is that Europe needs to have a single tax system"" on digital matters."
IT_102	20	"For EU Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, ""it was by no means a failure: at the beginning, 4 or 5 countries were in favor, now there are 23 or 24, but the decision on digital taxation requires unanimity."""
IT_105	1	Greece, U.S. strategy for energy investment: move from tourism to access privatization in green
IT_105	2	Green energy in tandem with gas :
IT_105	3	This is how the U.S. develops its strategy in the 'Aegean after the signatures for the Eastmed gas pipeline that will, in fact, revolutionize the energy supply for Europe and the balance, of alliances and agreements, for the entire Mediterranean area.
IT_105	4	For this reason, Washington , having established a partnership of a military nature with Greece , thanks to the agreement signed by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo , and the premier, Kyriakos Mitsotakis , for the use of four bases on Hellenic soil, is now betting big on green and privatization.
IT_105	5	Two U.S. private equity funds want to invest in the Greek tourism market , with more than $1 billion in capital.
IT_105	6	But it will only be the antechamber for U.S. interest in the energy sector, with the possible privatization of Greek companies Depa Elpe and Deddie and the upcoming opening in Athens of the headquarters of the largest U.S. renewable energy company.
IT_105	7	"A move that comes at a time when the new EU Commission is working on the Green New Deal with the allocation of 1.trillion euros over ten years as a ""commitment of solidarity and fairness to those who face the deepest challenges to make this journey with us,"" as announced by Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans Some data on which to baste new actions and directions of travel were disseminated by Professor Robert Pollin , founder of Peri, the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts, who gave a lecture in Athens in recent days entitled The Path to Global Climate Stabilization through a Global Green New Deal at the Goulandris Museum of National History."
IT_105	8	Its main goal is a zero-emission economy in the next 30 years.
IT_105	9	But how to realize it?
IT_105	10	The Green New Deal, he said, would increase economic activity and create more jobs than those lost due to the closure of the fossil fuel sector.
IT_105	11	Take 1 million euros from coal and put it into green investments, it is the same job creation, or 20 jobs per million euros: that is his argument.
IT_105	12	This would be ideal leverage for a country with Greece's economic structure because it creates opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses, collaborative projects and energy communities.
IT_105	13	This is how the Greek government finalized the final draft of its national energy plan last Dec. 19, which it submitted to Brussels, after the green light came from the European Investment Bank (EIB) for a $700 million co-financing to build wind farms, photovoltaic plants, biomass/biogas plants and hydroelectric power plants throughout the country.
IT_105	14	Some major U.S. entities, therefore, are planning initiatives in Greece precisely for the purpose of creating a green pathway that parallels gas.
IT_105	15	Indeed, Ellas is taking on the role of Mediterranean gas-hub for the simultaneous transit of the Tap Tanap and Eastmed pipelines, effectively changing its specific weight.
IT_105	16	This is demonstrated by, among other things, two interesting projects already underway.
IT_105	17	Tesla's laboratory in Attica, where Musk's group is developing new high-speed solar trains, has been operational for two years, and a European project to equip an Aegean island with clean batteries entered its final phase a year ago.
IT_113	1	Rome, waste-to-energy plant: the European Union promotes the plant.
IT_113	2	Gualtieri will meet with mayors
IT_113	3	Executive Vice President of the EU with responsibility for the Green Deal .
IT_113	4	After support from the government , which gave him commissioner powers, Roberto Gualtieri also gets a half-goal from the European Union .
IT_113	5	Interviewed by Radio 24, Timmermans explained, We are in contact with Gualtieri every week.
IT_113	6	If that were still not enough, Timmermans-a personal friend of Gualtieri, with whom he watched the Conference League semifinal between Roma and Leicester together at the Stadio Olimpico-reported that he also spent time as a consultant on the best technology to use in the capital.
IT_113	7	Also at the microphones of Sole24Ore radio, he announced: I know that next week when there will be a final match between Roma and Feyenoord in Tirana, the mayors of Rome and Rotterdam (Ahmed Aboutaleb, ed.) will meet to talk about this situation, to discuss waste management and waste-to-energy.
IT_113	8	Aboutaleb should therefore explain to his Roman colleague the merits and demerits of a waste-to-energy plant , since there is a similar plant in the Dutch port center .
IT_113	9	They are putting on the brakes from the Campidoglio, because the first Roman citizen would not yet have decided whether to attend the game at the Kombëtare Arena on May 25.
IT_113	10	Although Gualtieri will surely hear Aboutaleb like other mayors of cities like London who dispose of waste by burning it to turn it into energy.
IT_113	11	The European Union is familiar with the Roman situation, having opened infringement proceedings for its failure to clean up the former Malagrotta landfill.
IT_113	12	But this is not the body responsible for authorizing waste processing plants, although it has already made it known that member countries must accelerate activities in the field of circular economy, prioritizing material processing even over energy production in waste disposal and treatment processes.
IT_113	13	Given the direction, Rome wants to bring the level of recycling by the end of this council term close to 60 percent.
IT_113	14	It is now just over 46 percent.
IT_113	15	MONTECITORIO.
IT_113	16	Yesterday, meanwhile, the House slipped on the final go-ahead for the Aiuti decree, where the government included special powers for the mayor of Rome precisely to speed up the startup of the waste-to-energy plant.
IT_113	17	In the text, Gualtieri, not only can he include the plant among the strategic works for the Jubilee by taking advantage of the tools already obtained to speed up those works, but he can also bypass the restrictions of the regional plan that does not provide for such sites and, in fact, approve the necessary permits without the regional council's okay.
IT_113	18	In Montecitorio, fibrillations in the majority caused the quorum to fail three times.
IT_113	19	And among the ongoing tensions are those related to the Fifteen, who are opposed to the waste-to-energy plant .
IT_113	20	In recent days there have been rumors of possible agreements between M5S and Pd to vote on an amendment to the Aid Decree that would recognize the need to focus on plants closer to the circular economy model.
IT_113	21	A more cosmetic text that would allow the Grillians, in the junta with the PD and Nicola Zingaretti in the Lazio region, to save face.
IT_113	22	A hypothesis that Gualtieri does not like.
IT_113	23	Who, yesterday, in a videoconference discussion with elected Dem members in the House precisely to remind them of the importance of approving special powers for the waste-to-energy plant in the decree.
IT_113	24	From the parliamentarians came a promise to armor that amendment and not to compromise with M5S.
IT_113	25	Meanwhile, if in recent days the Roman grillini launched a collection of signatures to block the plant to be built in Santa Palomba, yesterday the Italian radicals -- in favor of the work -- responded with a referendum on the waste-to-energy plant .
IT_113	26	Let Secretary Massimiliano Iervolino know: We are asking Gualtieri to consult the city on the 600-thousand-ton annual waste-to-energy plant through an advisory referendum, because history teaches us that without popular consent no plant can be built.
IT_113	27	With popular legitimacy everything would be easier.
IT_113	28	We cannot afford another five years of inaction.
IT_113	29	Different approach in Pomezia , a municipality that borders Santa Palomba: the city council approved almost unanimously (with votes in favor from the 5-Star Movement, Pd, Fratelli d'Italia and Lega) an agenda that says no to the construction of the waste burner.
IT_117	1	Synthetic meat, the government's clampdown:
IT_117	2	here is what it is and how it is produced
IT_117	3	From the topic to insects in food to synthetic meat, all in 48 hours or so.
IT_117	4	A revolution that has been heralded for years is coming to the plates, but now it is becoming strictly topical and addressed at the government level, with the discussion in the Council of Ministers of a bill that would ban its production and sale.
IT_117	5	But let's understand more about synthetic meat, what it is and what would be the pros and cons of its (currently banned) use.
IT_117	6	Are there any practical examples?
IT_117	7	Yes, in Israel the company Supermeat makes synthetic chicken meat.
IT_117	8	"""The no-GMO chicken cells placed in the fermenters multiply indefinitely: there the meat grows from these cells fed with water, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, vitamins and sugars,"" Ido Savir, CEO of SuperMeat , parent company of the 'restaurant' The Chicken had told Taste at the product presentation."
IT_117	9	"""When it comes out of the fermenter, it looks similar to ground beef, but with long fibers."""
IT_117	10	"Another company, the British startup Primeval Foods , is working on lion steaks, tiger burgers, zebra sushi, giraffe ham, ""a new frontier without killing animals."""
IT_117	11	Even in Italy there are those who have been active for some time: Bruno Cell is a startup born in Trentino, Italy, in the laboratories of CIBIO, the Center for Integrated Biology.
IT_117	12	"A project of the University of Trento and the Autonomous Province of Trento ""to explore the potential of biotechnology for human health."""
IT_117	13	And even in Singapore there is a restaurant that serves synthetic meat, produced by the American Eat Just.
IT_117	14	How does the processing take place?
IT_117	15	In a fermenter, cells fed oxygen, feed and heat grow as they would in an animal's body, taking advantage of the stem cells' ability to replicate indefinitely, doubling every 12 hours under the right conditions.
IT_117	16	Once mature, it is harvested, the remaining feed liquid removed, and a mince-like meat with long fibers is obtained and vacuum compacted.
IT_117	17	What would be the benefits?
IT_117	18	Producers claim that meat does not produce waste, drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions, about 98 percent compared to conventional livestock farming, and does not require as much water, 99 percent less, as well as 99 percent less land use.
IT_117	19	"""Growing meat in a controlled environment means producing it by lowering the use of antibiotics and drugs, thus potentially leading to significant improvements regarding the increasingly pressing issue of the impact of food on health and the environment,"" says Professor Luciano Conti, on the ""Bruno Cell"" website."
IT_117	20	"The advantages/disadvantages scheme according to ""Brunocell"" What would be the disadvantages?"
IT_117	21	"In a public talk, Professor Giorgio Calabrese, an expert and author of articles for Taste, pointed out that ""we are not concerned about the harm that is created in the consumer, there are mechanisms that arise from the stem cells and go to block certain genes, such as P53, that give a condition to restrain the development of cancer cells."""
IT_117	22	What is the difference between synthetic meat and vegetable meat?
IT_117	23	Synthetic meat is made from the embryos of the animal, plant-based meat uses mainly legumes and the proteins in them as meat substitutes, and combined with flavorings and other ingredients, they try to reproduce the texture and taste of the animal product.
IT_117	24	How much meat is consumed today?
IT_117	25	Global consumption of traditional meat has increased by 58 percent in the past 20 years.
IT_117	26	According to research conducted by the World Economic Forum, an estimated 50 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, half a billion sheep and 300 million cows are slaughtered each year.
IT_117	27	To satisfy a population of more than nine billion, meat production is estimated to increase by 73 percent by 2050.
IT_117	28	To sustain this level of growth, land use will have to increase between 30 percent and 50 percent.
IT_117	29	What business is there around synthetic meat?
IT_117	30	In 2013, the first hamburger made from lab-grown meat had cost $300,000.
IT_117	31	Three years later the market price of a meatball produced by Memphis Meat had dropped to $20,000 per pound.
IT_117	32	In early 2021 Future Meat Technologies announced that it had succeeded in making a 160-gram chicken breast for only $4 four.
IT_117	33	According to an analysis by the McKinsey firm, by 2030 synthetic meat will cost as much as animal meat.
IT_117	34	And Barclays estimates that the synthetic steak business could be worth up to $450 billion by 2040, or 20 percent of the global meat market.
IT_131	1	Italy-China: Di Maio, in US to reaffirm importance of alliance
IT_131	2	.
IT_131	3	"The trip to the U.S. ""is part of the strong bilateral relations that Italy has always maintained with the United States."
IT_131	4	"They are our main ally, and my visit will be a time to reiterate that concretely."""
IT_131	5	The deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, told Corriere della Sera after concerns were expressed by the U.S. over the signing of the agreement between Italy and China.
IT_131	6	"""We are a NATO country, well aware of its alliances, but equally an independent country capable of facing new business opportunities."
IT_131	7	"And this we did with the Silk Road,"" Di Maio continued, adding that during the trip ""I will see representatives of the administration."""

IT_131	9	Brexit:
IT_131	10	What the indicative grades predict.
IT_131	11	MILAN(MF-DJ)--British MPs are expected to vote tomorrow on a range of alternative options to Brexit.
IT_131	12	The first option remains British Prime Minister Theresa May's agreement.
IT_131	13	Although it has already been rejected twice, it is the only exit plan that the EU can quickly ratify and remains under consideration.
IT_131	14	"May herself has repeatedly said that ""it is the only realistic option."""
IT_131	15	The second alternative is no-deal, which would mean for the UK, leaving the EU on April 12 without a deal.
IT_131	16	Another option involves eliminating the backstop.
IT_131	17	In theory, it would mean rewriting the EU divorce agreement to remove the proposed customs alignment aimed at securing a free Irish border if a long-term free trade agreement cannot be signed.
IT_131	18	However, this does not seem a realistic option, as the European bloc has always made it clear that the backstop issue is intrinsic to the agreement.
IT_131	19	The fourth alternative involves a free trade agreement taking Canada as an example.
IT_131	20	It would impose an economic cost on Britain for a freer EU-UK relationship and would not solve the Irish border problem.
IT_131	21	Another option is permanent membership in the customs union.
IT_131	22	"This alternative has been described by European Council President Donald Tusk as ""promising,"" but because it is being promoted by Labour it is unlikely to attract Conservative support."
IT_131	23	Sixth option is a relationship with the EU based on a free trade agreement like the one Norway has, which would keep the UK in the single market, accepting freedom of movement, and in the customs union.
IT_131	24	The last option involves a second referendum.
IT_132	1	Libya, oil terminals stranded: 260 million lost.
IT_132	2	Violent clashes in Tripoli
IT_132	3	the latest news on the war .
IT_132	4	While the truce invoked by the world in Berlin is yet another piece of paper in the Libyan crisis shredded by guns, an accurate first calculation of the damage General Khalifa Haftar is managing to produce by blocking oil terminals and fields has arrived: nearly $260 million in six days.
IT_132	5	The figure (256.6 million) was provided by Libya's national oil company, Noc, which put current production at just over 320,000 barrels per day, down three-quarters from more than 1.2 million last week.
IT_132	6	Noc's prediction remains that Libyan crude oil extraction could collapse further in a few days to 72 barrels , a level similar to that at the time of Muammar Gaddafi's fall in 2011.
IT_132	7	Haftar a week ago, just the day before the Libya conference in the German capital, had crude oil cargo blocked from five ports under his control in the Sirte oil crescent causing an export cut of 800,000 barrels a day.
IT_132	8	Through closing valves in two pipelines, the general also had the Sharara , Libya's largest, and Hamada oil fields shut down and reduce production in the El Feel field, also operated by Eni, potentially cutting an additional approximately 400,000 barrels per day overall.
IT_132	9	In addition to wanting to throw his weight around in Berlin, according to analysts such as Tim Eaton of the U.S. think-tank Chatham House, the general thus concretizes his accusation that Noc is siding with Tripoli and the government of PM Fayez al-Sarraj even though the international community agrees that the oil company is and should remain an impartial institution between the two sides.
IT_132	10	Fronts fighting each other, as evidenced by the destruction of some of Haftar's military assets announced by pro-government forces in the area of Wadi al-Rabie, about 25 km as the crow flies southeast of Martyrs' Square, the center of Tripoli , by the sea: although no casualties are reported beyond the more than 2,000 commonly estimated dead among militiamen (not counting the nearly 300 civilians killed), the destruction of assets is a sign that the fighting is violent.
IT_132	11	Reciprocal are the accusations of violating the cease-fire, repeatedly ignored moreover already in recent days.
IT_132	12	Last update: 7:10 p.m.
IT_136	1	The Tsar's Web.
IT_136	2	Taking back the EU using Tripoli
IT_136	3	She could have taken him to Tripoli, but she stopped him one step early.
IT_136	4	Now everything is clear.
IT_136	5	General Khalifa Haftar is a protégé of Vladimir Putin, but he is not his winning horse.
IT_136	6	He is the best ally to stop Turkey and expand the Russian sphere of influence from the Middle East to North Africa, but his role stops there.
IT_136	7	In the Kremlin's plans, the general is too old to guarantee long-term arrangements.
IT_136	8	And it is too divisive to secure Russian economic interests in a Libya that in Putin's plans is to be kept united.
IT_136	9	By accompanying Haftar's offensive, but stopping it at the gates of Misrata and Tripoli, the Kremlin laid the groundwork for the exploitation of Sirte's oil concessions obtained a decade ago from Qaddafi and the construction of the Benghazi-Sirte railway.
IT_136	10	But for the Russian president, Libya is a platform from which to develop much broader strategic political goals.
IT_136	11	The most ambitious is an attempt to exploit Donald Trump's self-marginalization of the U.S. to sketch a new world order.
IT_136	12	This is precisely why Putin refuses to dismember our former colony.
IT_136	13	And he is very careful to be perceived not as a conqueror but as a peacemaker.
IT_136	14	This is also why he is careful not to give Haftar a total victory, which would guarantee him the gratitude of the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but would sour relations with European countries.
IT_136	15	Exploiting Europe's weakness by granting it a role in that Libya where the mistakes of France and Italy and the irrelevance of Brussels have led it to marginalization is, instead, an opportunity to widen the Atlantic and further distance the Old Continent from the traditional American ally.
IT_136	16	In this perspective Angela Merkel is proving to be an excellent ally.
IT_136	17	By extending her hand on Libya Putin enabled her to schedule for Sunday the 19th that conference on Libya that now seemed a mission impossible.
IT_136	18	In return, Berlin gave the go-ahead, to the completion of North Stream 2, defying U.S. sanctions, and pledged to work together to reach a peace agreement in that Ukraine that has been poisoning Moscow relations for six years-Germany, in short, could also drag the rest of Europe into an orbit much closer to Moscow's interests.
IT_136	19	Too bad that the Russian capital is the only one where our Giuseppe Conte and Luigi Di Maio, who have been engaged for weeks in diplomatic wandering to the four corners of Europe and the Mediterranean, forgot to knock.
IT_149	1	Perini, with us, Alghero's airport gets its wings back.
IT_149	2	Alghero is flying again.
IT_149	3	Arriving in July 2018, Alberto Perini, the general manager of Sogeaal, the management company for Alghero's Riviera del Corallo airport, lifts his head from papers, contracts, business agreements and accounts to be squared to chart the course.
IT_149	4	It does so in the aftermath of the release of some encouraging data: the airport is growing by 12 percent, approaching the numbers of its best years, and preparing for a 2020 in which the tentative signs of the winter season that has just begun should be consolidated: the goal of 1.5 million passengers is being targeted.
IT_149	5	In merely analyzing the data with Fabio Gallo, director of business development and finance for the company, Perini uses a few key words.
IT_149	6	"""We are committed to a journey that has taken time and dedication,"" is the premise."
IT_149	7	"Because first of all, he explains, ""Sogeaal is a private company that operates a public service concession, but to do it well it needs to be solid and to look at its own balanced, sustainable and long-term development."""
IT_149	8	"""Giving solidity to the company's balance sheets and structure was the first step in securing its future in real support of the territory,"" this was the motivation for a silence that is only now breaking."
IT_149	9	"""Because the results are beginning to show,"" Perini confirmed, ""and we are here to say that the airport is there, Sogeaal is there, we are there, the shareholders are there."
IT_149	10	"And they are there with conviction, with designs for stable, sustainable and true growth, along a path we have just embarked on to continue growing within a territory that helps us in this direction."""
IT_149	11	Those who feared that privatization would result in staff cuts have been disavowed.
IT_149	12	Those who were thinking of farewell to infrastructure and business investment also.
IT_149	13	Those who predicted that F2i, the majority shareholder, would only be here in passing appear to have been wrong.
IT_149	14	The numbers and some facts say so, such as the multi-year development agreement that restores Ryanair to its former centrality, but within a system where other carriers also play an important role-especially in perspective.
IT_149	15	The real challenge being worked on, after all, is to create a destination, and that is not a game Sogeaal can play alone.
IT_149	16	The North Sardinia Metropolitan Network recently allocated 3m euros for the promotion of the area within the airport.
IT_149	17	Private individuals have recently turned their noses up at the silence of corporate management.
IT_149	18	The data, from the surplus budgets to the increase in traffic, from the relaunch for airport expansion to the consolidation of investments on the quality of airport services, are a first, substantial response.
IT_149	19	Alghero issues a challenge to the skies of Europe.
IT_153	1	IMF scares Italy: GDP down 12.8 percent.
IT_153	2	Worldwide already lost 300 million jobs
IT_153	3	Treasury Secretary Roberto Gualtieri rates them as pessimistic estimates and says the reopening of operations after the end of the lockdown is having tangible effects.
IT_153	4	Economists at the Monetary Fund unfortunately see it differently.
IT_153	5	They speak of catastrophic consequences of the virus on the global labor market and 300 million jobs burned.
IT_153	6	By the end of the year they estimate Italy's GDP will nosedive 12.8 percent, nearly four points higher than in April.
IT_153	7	The most serious consequence is on public accounts: if the figure is confirmed, Italian debt would rise from 134.8 percent to 166.1 this year.
IT_153	8	We are at the levels at which-a few years ago-Greece found itself on the financial precipice.
IT_153	9	Fortunately, the background conditions are completely different, and the European Central Bank is the main buyer of Italian government bonds.
IT_153	10	In compensation, the Fund also revises its estimates of the rebound in 2021, projected at 6.3 percent.
IT_153	11	There is only one country on the entire planet that will not go into recession this year, and that is China, which will grow by just one percentage point.
IT_153	12	In short, a tough autumn awaits us.
IT_153	13	The Court of Accounts speaks of a serious situation, calls for government credibility, a quick strategy for recovery and, despite the debt situation, a reform that lowers taxes.
IT_153	14	With local elections just around the corner -- in September -- the majority would have something to gain, but the government still seems to have its head inside the emergency.
IT_153	15	Gualtieri goes to the Budget Committee and announces a new decree for July.
IT_153	16	The climate with the oppositions is incandescent, to the point of forcing Leghist President Claudio Borghi to suspend the session after a protest by party colleague Igor Iezzi.
IT_153	17	Gualtieri does not go into the details of the and figures, but government sources speak of 15, maybe 20 billion for refinancing of the redundancy fund, increased resources to municipalities, the guarantee fund for companies seeking liquidity from banks, and the postponement of upcoming tax deadlines.
IT_153	18	There is also the possibility of reduced social security contributions for companies, a way to reduce labor costs and avoid layoffs.
IT_153	19	Of tax cuts for families and retirees (the request of the Tax Court) to support the recovery, there is no sign.
IT_153	20	Nor are changes to citizenship income rules on the agenda, which-in the words of the attorney general-has provided jobs for just two percent of its beneficiaries.
IT_153	21	Amendments to the relaunch decree are to be discussed in committee, but the text is moving forward slowly, too slowly.
IT_153	22	According to the timetable, the text should have already been in the courtroom, but instead it will not get there until July 3.
IT_153	23	The decree has 266 articles: impossible to go into detail in such a short time.
IT_153	24	A vote of confidence will be imposed to speed things up.
IT_153	25	Two changes have already been decided upon: the first includes the possibility for companies to anticipate four weeks of fall layoffs as of now, and thus avoid further tensions around Inps delays.
IT_153	26	"The second concerns the so-called ""superpowers"" granted to Gualtieri."
IT_153	27	The decree allows the treasury minister to move budget items (albeit within balances) without going through Parliament.
IT_153	28	The amendment confirms the power but writes that the ministry, if and when it decides to take funds from one chapter for the other, must forward the change to the committees for an opinion.
IT_159	1	Volkswagen, big electric offensive: 10 new family IDs by 2026.
IT_159	2	Expectation for concept of the unprecedented entry level ID.
IT_159	3	Golf
IT_159	4	More details about Volkswagen's commitment to electric in the coming years will most likely be released in the coming days at the traditional prior-year financial results conference.
IT_159	5	But by combining all available information-from spy photos to official reports-Carscoops magazine has already put together an exhaustive roadmap of the next electric milestones, which include the launch of 10 new battery-powered models by 2026, a figure that has been officially confirmed by Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schfer.
IT_159	6	It should be reiterated immediately that all of Vw's upcoming electric vehicles will be based on the updated MEB Plus architecture, which will offer improvements in range, technology, safety, and performance over models using the current platform introduced in 2019.
IT_159	7	After 2026 the new modular architecture SSP (Scalable Systems Platform) will make its entrance into the Volkswagen industrial world.
IT_159	8	The operation to renew and broaden the offerings began these days with the ID.3 2024 edition undergoing a mid-cycle redesign.
IT_159	9	It will continue in 2024 with ID.7 the brand's first all-electric sedan, which aims to rival the Tesla Model 3.
IT_159	10	The debut is scheduled for April 17 at the Shanghai Auto Show, with parallel events to be held in Germany and the United States.
IT_159	11	Volkswagen has not announced the technical specifications of the ID.7 but has promised an electric range of up to 700 km value probably close to the limit of the MEB Plus architecture with current technology and battery capacity.
IT_159	12	Next will be the debut of the 'hot' variants of the ID.3 and ID.7 marked by the GTX acronym (under consideration, however, for replacement by GTI).
IT_159	13	They will not be as extreme as the heat-engine R models, but they will offer superior performance, thanks to dual engines for a total of 350 hp.
IT_159	14	This configuration is expected to be inherited from the ID.4 GTX and ID.5 GTX, which have 299 hp.
IT_159	15	In 2024, Volkswagen is expected to introduce the station wagon variant of the ID.7, further expanding its range of electric vehicles to cover hitherto neglected segments.
IT_159	16	The zero-emission equivalent of the Passat Variant has been closely anticipated by ID.
IT_159	17	Space Vizzin of 2019.
IT_159	18	Also scheduled for 2025 is the facelift and mid-life update of the ID.4 and ID.5.
IT_159	19	Similar upgrades to the ID.3 are planned, including improved quality in the cabin.
IT_159	20	The launch of the electric entry-level with two body variants (sedan and crossover) is also planned for that period.
IT_159	21	No relation to the ID.Life of 2021, a model that came out of the company's plans and was completely redesigned.
IT_159	22	According to the latest information, writes Carscoops, the entry-level electric will be previewed as a concept as early as the next few days-almost certainly on March 15 at the 2022 financial results conference-but the production version will not arrive until 2025.
IT_159	23	Although it was initially christened ID.2, there are rumors that it may adopt the name ID.Golf, as the company wishes to keep this historic name alive in the era of electric vehicles.
IT_159	24	Finally around 2024-2025 will come (highly anticipated in that market) the long-wheelbase version with U.S. specifications of the ID.Buzz minivan.
IT_159	25	The one named California and intended for camping will follow in the second half of the decade.
IT_160	1	Asset management, inflows still in the red in February.
IT_160	2	But equities remain positive
IT_160	3	The month ends with negative flows of 1.94 billion due to redemptions from institutional asset management of 2 billion.
IT_160	4	Funds made -356 million but equities remain positive (1.32 billion after 1.73 billion in January).
IT_160	5	First by Soul collection
IT_160	6	February still negative for asset management flows in Italy.
IT_160	7	Assogestioni's map reports that inflows in the month were negative 1.94 billion euros, following -927 million in January , for a total in the two-month period of -2.86 billion.
IT_160	8	Industry assets fell to 2.242 trillion (from 2.267 trillion at the end of January) due in part to the market effect, which the association's Office of Research estimates at -1 percent for the month.
IT_160	9	Influencing the inflows figures were mainly the 2 billion outflows recorded by institutional asset management during the month, while retail asset management was positive by 282 million.
IT_160	10	Equity funds always positive.
IT_160	11	On the other hand, the consolidation of the trends of recent months in open-end funds continues : despite February closing with net inflows of -356 million (including +597 million on Italian-registered funds and -952 million related to foreign-registered funds), both equity (+1.32 billion) and bond funds (+570 million) remained in positive territory.
IT_160	12	In particular, the inflows recorded on the former raise the amount raised since the beginning of the year by this product category above 3 billion to +3.06 billion.
IT_160	13	By contrast, balanced and flexible funds were still below par in February, posting outflows of 719 million (-625 million in January) and 1.41 billion (-1.67 billion in January), respectively.
IT_160	14	Closed-end funds, on the other hand, ended the month with positive inflows of 140 million (after +214 million in January).
IT_160	15	Ranking by management company.
IT_160	16	In first place for inflows in the month is Anima with 326 million, followed by Arca with 277 million, Jp Morgan Am with 225 million, Sella with 213 million, and Mediolanum with 208 million.
IT_160	17	On the other hand, the Intesa Sanpaolo group was in the red (-309 million) due to outflows recorded by Eurizon (-476 million), while Fideuram had positive inflows of 166 million.
IT_160	18	Also among the biggies below par were Generali (-1.28 billion), Amundi (420 million) and the Post Office (-484 million).
IT_160	19	The Trieste-based company points out that the inflows result is mainly due to flows on money funds and management mandates on group insurance portfolios .
IT_160	20	Finally, it is reported that , which no longer appears in the association's statistics because it left last year, raised a total of 1.55 billion in February of which 1.34 billion was in asset management.
IT_163	1	Highways, the wrong letter
IT_163	2	Autostrade's scathing letter, in retort to the rules inserted by the government in a decree to stipulate that if, as a result of its serious default, a concessionaire is declared forfeited, the damages caused by its negligence will be deducted from the (copious) compensation it would be entitled to, is proof that Aspi has not only maintenance problems but also communication problems, not only technical problems but also cultural problems.
IT_163	3	But other reflections arise from this ugly letter.
IT_163	4	In the meantime, a question: how has privatization been done in Italy, if provision has been made that, in case of proven fault of the concessionaire, the concessionaire will lapse from the concession with the right to the same compensation that he would be entitled to if the concession were taken away from him without any just cause?
IT_163	5	And then a thought: the idea of everything reverting to Anas is national suicide, because the company, proverbial for its laziness and bureaucratic slowness (to say the least), would either risklessly close everything or almost everything (with the golden principle of public administration: I don't want any trouble) or definitely do nothing: the state of the state highways is there to be a text for those who dream of a return to the republic of cantonment.
IT_163	6	But that it has not been possible, after the tragic Morandi experience, to find a dialogue between the state and concessionaires to review the most unbalanced aspects of concessions is truly puzzling.
IT_163	7	On the one hand money, on the other propaganda: two needs that are not conducive to agreements.
IT_163	8	But while it is understandable that Aspi could not confront Toninelli's linguistic maximalism, the fact that he cannot even relate to Minister De Micheli's civilized and moderate language is truly unbelievable and is all to his detriment.
IT_163	9	That said out of respect for the truth of the facts, however, one thing remains to be added for intellectual honesty.
IT_163	10	The Morandi Bridge fell one year and four months ago, and a court judgment on the causes and responsibilities of its collapse is still far from even in sight.
IT_163	11	The case is complex and is understood to be time-consuming.
IT_163	12	But since then Aspi (especially her) has been in the dock and has seen accusations, shreds of evidence, excerpts of interrogations, excerpts of documents, interviews raining down on her every day, to which, partly because of her inability to communicate publicly blatantly reiterated by the letter to the government, she knows how to respond only with the unpopular delaying maneuvers of her lawyers, good for stalling but certainly not for dispelling suspicions.
IT_163	13	Perhaps in a country of less entangled and chatty law, it would have already been ruled that, if it did not fall because of a traumatic event, the bridge collapsed because of its precarious condition, and the maintainer would then have been convicted, whether or not he was awarded mitigation on the basis of actual cognizability of actual attrition.
IT_163	14	Instead, investigations are proceeding and will proceed with the concordant slowness of prosecutors, gip and defenses in an endless, very costly series of expert reports, exceptions, evidentiary incidents, postponements, etc.
IT_163	15	So goes our justice.
IT_163	16	Unfortunately, pending the only authorized judgment, that of a court of law, which, if of guilt, would really nail Aspi to a conviction for gross misconduct and then to procedures to revoke the concession, the months of investigation have so far resolved mostly into a trickle of rumors, statements, half-news, alarms, in a noisy judicial-media circuit.
IT_163	17	In all likelihood, Aspi's fault is really there.
IT_163	18	Benetton himself seemed to recognize it.
IT_163	19	But is this way of proceeding serious?
IT_163	20	What can a foreigner think of a trial held in the investigation and in the newspapers too much before the real one (assuming it is ever held)?
IT_163	21	His letter to the government shows that, perhaps, Aspi deserves nothing, although his very recent willingness to reduce or abolish the tolls owed to him in Liguria improves his unsympathetic profile somewhat.
IT_163	22	But everyone, even the powerful multinational corporations with poor sensibilities, is entitled to fair, sober and expeditious law enforcement committed to trials rather than media chatter.
IT_172	1	San Donà di Piave, Open Fiber: 'Italy 1 Giga Plan' construction sites kick off
IT_172	2	"Open Fiber's construction sites are starting in San Donà di Piave as part of the "" Italy 1 Giga Plan "": the digitization project financed with funds from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan through the call for tenders issued by Infratel ."
IT_172	3	Added to the public funds, which amount to 70 percent of the project, is an additional 30 percent funded by Open Fiber.
IT_172	4	The intervention covers areas not covered by at least one network capable of providing download connection speeds of 300 Mbit/s or more, which largely coincide with so-called gray areas.
IT_172	5	In the municipality, the project covers the hamlets of Mussetta di Sopra, Grassaga, Fossà, Fiorentina, Cittanova, Calvecchia, Palazzetto, and Isiata where an FTTH (Fiber To The Home) infrastructure will be laid, with the first homes to be connected as early as January 2023.
IT_172	6	"""At last, construction is being unblocked for the still uncovered areas of San Donà to equip them with an important and long-awaited infrastructure that completes the 'ultrawideband' coverage, a connection speed that citizens and businesses feel the need for."
IT_172	7	"We are pleased with the collaboration with Open Fiber, which was the first to invest in San Donà,"" says San Donà's innovation councilor, Stefano Serafin ""The pandemic has highlighted all the limitations of our technological network, which is absent or undersized in many areas."
IT_172	8	These new interventions will perhaps cause some inconvenience, but this will be more than compensated for by extensive and homogeneous connectivity throughout the municipality.
IT_172	9	"I would like to thank Open Fiber for the constant coordination with the offices and the Administration that has allowed us to kick off these new interventions in a very quick time,"" comments the Councillor for Public Works Lorena Marin ""Thanks to the excellent relationship with the Municipal Administration today in San Donà di Piave we can start the construction site to build the ultra-wideband infrastructure of the ""1 Giga Italy Plan"" - underlines Alberto Sperandio , Regional Manager of Open Fiber in Veneto -."
IT_172	10	But it is not the only Open Fiber-branded intervention in the city.
IT_172	11	In fact, the works of the so-called 'white areas' will also start soon and, as concessionaires of the public tender of Infratel in Veneto, we will connect an additional 1145 housing units in the hamlets of Isiata, Palazzetto, Passarella, Chiesanuova, Caposile and Santa Maria di Piave.
IT_172	12	"Real estate units that add to the more than 14 thousand already wired (and put up for sale) by Open Fiber, with a private investment of about 5 million euros, through an FTTH network that spans about 125 kilometers (equal to about 9 thousand kilometers of fiber to be laid)."""
IT_172	13	Countless benefits for citizens, businesses and municipal government of a connection that can reach speeds of 10 Gigabits per second.
IT_172	14	They range from telemedicine to smart working .
IT_172	15	From electronic access control to environmental monitoring and management of public lighting .
IT_172	16	In addition, fiber optics is also of paramount importance in terms of eco-sustainability and energy conservation.
IT_172	17	For example, a high-performance network helps reduce the travel of people who can perform actions remotely compared with physical presence.
IT_172	18	And again, the fiber optic network is passive, meaning it is not powered by electricity.
IT_173	1	Tax bills, 5 years to sort them out.
IT_173	2	Assessments, need to be cross-examined
IT_173	3	"The IRS will have to be ""kinder"" to taxpayers."
IT_173	4	And it will have to be especially so at the time of assessment and collection, that is, when knocking on the door to challenge errors, missed payments, forgetfulness, and attempts at avoidance.
IT_173	5	Tax bills, 5 years to sort them out.
IT_173	6	"The attempt at a ""de-escalation"" of relations between the IRS and taxpayers is perhaps one of the central features of the tax delegation that the government will present to the social partners today and is expected to be approved in the council of ministers on Thursday."
IT_173	7	Let's start with the assessment.
IT_173	8	The registered letter that will arrive to taxpayers will no longer be an outright challenge, it will rather be a proposal.
IT_173	9	That is, the IRS will tell the taxpayer the elements it has gathered about his or her tax position and the things the agency believes are wrong.
IT_173	10	"However, before this proposed assessment turns into an actual tax act, the taxpayer will have 60 days to respond with his or her own ""observations,"" submitting all the documentation he or she deems necessary to defend against the challenges."
IT_173	11	THE OBLIGATIONS The agency, in turn, will be obliged to take into account and respond to the taxpayer's comments before sending, if it still considers its reasons valid, the actual assessment notice.
IT_173	12	"This prior ""cross-examination"" between IRS and taxpayer will become mandatory."
IT_173	13	But there is not only this aspect.
IT_173	14	The proxy also includes another important step and one that could be summarized as: disturb honest taxpayers as little as possible.
IT_173	15	In fact, the government's measure stipulates that for assessments, the Internal Revenue Service must operate targeted actions suitable for restricting control activities to those with the highest tax risk, with less impact on citizens and businesses.
IT_173	16	How?
IT_173	17	Using artificial intelligence and all the databases (over 150) that are already available to the tax administration.
IT_173	18	Collection, that is, the stage that comes after the assessment, will also be profoundly reformed.
IT_173	19	The ultimate goal is to prevent the formation of more warehouses of uncollected files like the current one that has exceeded 1 trillion.
IT_173	20	THE PASSAGE How will it be done?
IT_173	21	First, with the rule of automatic discharge on December 31 of the fifth subsequent year of entrustment, of uncollected fees.
IT_173	22	It means that if a municipality has entrusted the collection of a fine to the Internal Revenue Service, if it has not been collected after five years it will be automatically written off.
IT_173	23	It does not mean, of course, that there will be an amnesty.
IT_173	24	Only that the collection of the folders will have to be done in a certain time frame and faster than at present.
IT_173	25	This is also why the first attempt to serve the folder, the proxy explains, must be made within a maximum of 9 months.
IT_173	26	The text also provides for the definitive overcoming of the dichotomy between the Internal Revenue Service and the Internal Revenue Service-Recovery.
IT_173	27	The latter will be incorporated into the former.
IT_173	28	"And, again with a view to a more ""dialogic"" IRS, the possibility of paying tax bills in 120 installments will be made structural in addition to the decision not to bother taxpayers with the notification of deeds in August, in the middle of summer, and in December, during the Christmas vacations."
IT_178	1	European stock exchanges uncertain, Wall Street down
IT_178	2	Swing day for European stock exchanges.
IT_178	3	After a positive start, the indexes changed direction veering into the negative to coincide with Mario Draghi's words and then the new estimates from Confindustria , which forecasts zero growth for 2019 for Italy, only to regain momentum beyond mid-session.
IT_178	4	"Speaking in Frankfurt, the Eurotower president said the ECB expects Eurozone growth to ""gradually return"" to a pace close to its potential, but risks ""remain tilted to the downside."""
IT_178	5	"Therefore, ""our monetary policy will remain accommodative and will respond to any changes in the inflation outlook."""
IT_178	6	"In any case, he assured, ""we are not short of tools to fulfill our mandate."""
IT_178	7	European stock exchanges thus all proceed cautiously upward, Milan rising 0.14 percent.
IT_178	8	Among others, London is flat, while Frankfurt and Paris move just above parity.
IT_178	9	Wall Street starts well then slides into the negative with the Dow Jones giving up 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq 0.82 percent.
IT_178	10	On the opposite note, however, on the Asian side, Tokyo moved , with the Nikkei ending trading down 0.23 percent.
IT_178	11	Meanwhile, the signs of concern coming from China's economy do not stop: according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the profits of Chinese industrial companies in the first two months of 2019 posted an annual decline of 14 percent, to 708.01 billion yuan (just under 90 billion euros): this is, it is explained, the sharpest slowdown since late 2011.
IT_178	12	In the stock market, it is still Fca in the spotlight after the Financial Times reported that Renault would be looking at Lingotto for a possible partnership.
IT_178	13	In recent days, the same London newspaper had explained that Chairman John Elkann had accelerated on this dossier in recent times, initiating dialogues with both French Fca and Korean manufacturers.
IT_178	14	On the currency front, the euro remains below $1.13, changing hands at $1.1256 and 124.41 yen.
IT_178	15	The spread starts little moved but then spikes over 260 points after Confindustria sounded the alarm, predicting zero growth for 2019 against the +1% estimated by the government. remains in the 250-point zone with the yield on our 10-year bond at 2.54%.
IT_178	16	Fears about Italy did not affect the government bond auction scheduled for today: the Treasury sold all six billion euros of six-month BOTs offered today, against demand that exceeded 9.5 billion.
IT_178	17	The average yield on the issue, which matures Sept. 30, 2019, is -0.062 percent, down five cents from the auction a month ago.
IT_178	18	Among the expected macroeconomic data, from France consumer confidence in March, for Italy Istat releases data on consumer and business confidence in March and extra eu foreign trade in February, from the United States the trade balance in January.
IT_178	19	Stable oil prices .
IT_178	20	Wti contracts give up 3 cents to $59.91 and Brent contracts rise 16 cents to $68.13 per barrel.
IT_178	21	Little moved gold at $1314 an ounce.
IT_181	1	ReiThera, from Unicredit first leasing financing in Italy with SACE Guarantee
IT_181	2	ReiThera S.r.l received from UniCredit Leasing , a UniCredit Group company, a loan of 2.9 million fully guaranteed by SACE .
IT_181	3	The total financing to the company, totaling 3.5 million, was completed with a 0.6 million share guaranteed by the Central Guarantee Fund.
IT_181	4	This is - the official note specifies - the first leasing transaction in Italy with Sace Guarantee .
IT_181	5	The new financial resources from the deal are in addition to the previous 5 million loan provided by UniCredit and covered by guarantees from the Central Fund, again as part of investments on the scientific research front.
IT_181	6	The peculiarity of the deal is the advantage of being able to purchase specific machinery in order to be able to speed up the process of producing, packaging and distributing a vaccine against the Covid-19 virus.
IT_181	7	The operation was structured with a duration of 60 months.
IT_181	8	"""The leasing loan c onceded to ReiThera,"" said Andrea Casini, Co-CEO Commercial Banking Italy at UniCredit, ""is the first in Italy with a SACE guarantee and confirms our Group's great attention to the urgent need to restart the Italian production system through the use of all possible solutions provided by the Liquidity Decree."
IT_181	9	A focus that also translates into speed of reaction.
IT_181	10	UniCredit Leasing's qualified support is in addition to its already established work with the Central Guarantee Fund.
IT_181	11	"With this additional financing we have the opportunity to support in its entirety the growth project and investments of ReiThera"" ""We are proud of this operation alongside ReiThera, an innovative company where Italian researchers, renowned worldwide for their skills, are working on the main challenge of this moment: the research, development and production of a vaccine against Covid-19 - said Simonetta Acri, Chief Mid Market Office of SACE ."

IT_195	3	"""Good the Bank of Italy report , which confirms the need for a fiscal shock to jumpstart the Italian economy."
IT_195	4	"Flat tax is the first reform that the government and Parliament will have to discuss."""
IT_195	5	So Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini after Governor Ignazio Visco's speech turns the Koch Palace's conclusions on the state of the national economy in his favor.

IT_195	7	"The governor of Bankitalia is convinced of this at the conclusion of the Final Considerations, adding that "" blaming Europe for our malaise is a mistake ; it brings no benefit and distracts from the real problems."""
IT_195	8	"""What are sometimes perceived as costs of euro membership are actually,"" Visco warns, ""the result of the country's delay in reacting to technological change and the opening of markets."
IT_195	9	"Almost every other country has done better than us."""
IT_195	10	"""Rising spread signal of tension"" As for the spread, if so far ""the transmission of the higher cost of government bonds to that of banks' lending to businesses and households has been limited, thanks to ample liquidity and better conditions of intermediaries' balance sheets."" today, ""however, signs of tension are beginning to emerge "" with a gradual tightening of ""loan offer policies, especially for small businesses,"" says the governor of the Bank of Italy, stressing the emerging consequences of the spread increase with risks that ""in situations of tension can sharpen, in the perception of the markets, abruptly."""
IT_195	11	"In addition, "" Italy still struggles to recover from the double-dip recession because it pays the price of an environment that, in terms of quality of public services and respect for rules, is not very conducive to entrepreneurial activity. ""Structural reforms and debt reduction are needed. ""A choral effort is needed, the participation of everyone, along a direction of travel that politics must clearly indicate."" Thus Visco speaking of the Italian outlook and citing a public budget more oriented ""toward measures to support labor and productive activity, "" a ""rigorous and credible strategy"" of debt reduction"" and ""far-reaching structural reforms"" ."
IT_195	12	"Instead, businesses will have to ""seize the opportunities offered by the market and technology."""
IT_195	13	"""Deep interventions on public accounts"" ""Increases in public spending or reductions in revenues,"" according to Bankitalia's governor, ""must be placed within a framework that ensures their financial sustainability and specifies their intent, priorities and sources of financing."
IT_195	14	"He points out, ""In order for the government budget to contribute to a sustained increase in the rate of output growth, profound interventions on the composition of spending and revenues are needed."""
IT_195	15	The governor defends immigration.
IT_195	16	"Visco then said he was convinced that immigration ""can make a contribution to the productive capacity of the country , but the difficulties we face in attracting high-skilled workers as well as in integrating and training those from other countries must be addressed."""
IT_195	17	"The governor then highlights ""the reduction in productive capacity associated with demographic trends"" and the burden on productivity of young people and college graduates who leave Italy each year."

IT_196	6	It is composed of Gabriele Galateri di Genola, Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, Clemente Rebecchini, Philippe Donnet, Romolo Bardin, Lorenzo Pellicioli, Sabrina Pucci, Alberta Figari, Diva Moriani, Paolo Di Benedetto, Antonella Mei-Pochtler, Maurizio Dattilo, and Barbara Negri.
IT_196	7	Mediobanca extends its heartfelt thanks to Ornella Barra, who was unable to renew her candidacy due to increased managerial commitments at Walgreens Boots Alliance, for her valuable contribution and constant commitment to the Board. of Assicurazioni Generali over the years.
IT_196	8	Antonella Mei-Pochtler's profile reflects, among other things, the direction of the Assicurazioni Generali Board to strengthen the Board's international experience and expertise in the technology and digital fields.
IT_196	9	GENERALS, CONFIRMATION FOR GALATERI.
IT_196	10	Renewal in continuity.
IT_196	11	This is the line adopted by Mediobanca for Generali's board moving toward renewal.

IT_196	13	Piazzetta Cuccia has identified the list of 13 candidates for the Lion's board, confirming in full most of the outgoing members.
IT_196	14	First and foremost, confidence, in a sign of willingness to implement the strategic plan approved last November, was renewed in outgoing chairman Gabriele Galateri di Genola (he had been a candidate by Vivendi for the Telecom board, an option that did not materialize last Friday), to 'ad Philippe Donnet and outgoing directors Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone (5.02%), Clemente Rebecchini, Lorenzo Pellicioli (top manager of the De Agostini group), Romolo Bardin (an expression of shareholder Leonardo Del Vecchio, 4.87%), Sabrina Pucci, Alberta Figari, Diva Moriani and Paolo Di Benedetto (in Caltagirone's share).
IT_196	15	Candidates who gave their approval of confirmation to consultant Spencer Stuart, called by Mediobanca to sound out availability for a reappointment.
IT_196	16	From this reconnaissance, only Ornella Barra, a prominent member of pharma giant Walgreens Boots Alliance, was found to be not interested in remaining on the board for another three-year term.
IT_196	17	Thus, Spencer Stuart herself evaluated the profiles of potential candidates, identifying the figure of Antonella Mei-Pochtler, special advisor to the Austrian chancellor and senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group of which she was also managing partner.
IT_196	18	The list reflects the recommendations made by the current board last February, reported in the shareholder guidance opinion on the size and composition of the board of directors for the three-year period 2019-2021, the Mediobanca note said, including the continuity of attendance with a view to implementing the new strategic plan approved by the board last November.
IT_196	19	And it is precisely the profile of the new entry Mei-Pochtler that reflects, among other things, the indication of Generali's board of directors to strengthen the board's international experience and expertise in the technological and digital fields, Piazzetta Cuccia further specifies.

IT_204	1	Coronavirus, serious Italian infected in Lombardy: wife and friend also positive.
IT_204	2	Quarantine for 60 people
IT_204	3	The man's infection may have occurred during a dinner with a friend who had just returned from China.
IT_204	4	The man was taken to Milan's Sacco Hospital in isolation, Welfare Councillor Giulio Gallera told Rainews microphones.
IT_204	5	But it has not been clarified whether he is the third positive person besides the 38-year-old's wife.
IT_204	6	"People who have been in contact with the patient,"" the councilor added, ""are being identified and subjected to specific checks and necessary measures."
IT_204	7	The 38-year-old positive in Codogno is the first case of infection in Italy, so we need to understand whether we are dealing with a small outbreak .
IT_204	8	A thorough epidemiological investigation is needed.
IT_204	9	Walter Ricciardi, professor of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine at the Catholic University of Rome and Italy's representative on the Executive Board of the World Health Organization, told Adnkronos Health.
IT_204	10	The 38-year-old man is hospitalized in intensive care at Codogno Hospital, whose emergency room admissions and scheduled activities, as a precautionary measure, are currently halted.
IT_204	11	A team from Milan's Sacco Hospital, which specializes in the treatment of infectious diseases, has meanwhile atrrivated to Codogno Hospital to see if the patient is transferable.
IT_204	12	The man showed up Thursday at the emergency room of the hospital in Codogno, Lodi.
IT_204	13	This was the second time the 38-year-old had been examined: in previous days he had been found to have only a slight fever.
IT_204	14	Since yesterday, health authorities have been reconstructing his movements to find out who are the people who came in contact with the patient.
IT_204	15	Activities in the emergency room and operating rooms were suspended during the period needed to disinfect the rooms.
IT_204	16	At the hospital, the entrances are completely barred to the public.
IT_204	17	People who at the drop of a hat arrive because they had scheduled appointments a while ago to perform examinations or tests are not let through, and they are asked to cancel the appointment to resume it later.
IT_204	18	Isolation We have already reconstructed both the contacts of doctors, nurses, close family members to whom we have already swabbed.
IT_204	19	They have all already been placed in solitary confinement or called to stay in isolation at their homes.
IT_204	20	His wife, his parents: this is how Lombardy's Welfare Councillor Giulio Gallera explained to RaiNews when talking about the Coronavirus-positive man hospitalized in Codogno, Lodi.
IT_204	21	The machine therefore moved swiftly, added the councilor.
IT_204	22	Burioni The latest news leads me to repeat for the umpteenth time the one important thing.
IT_204	23	Those returning from China must be quarantined.
IT_204	24	Without exception.
IT_204	25	I hope politicians understand this because the consequences of making a mistake would be irreparable.
IT_204	26	This was written by virologist Roberto Burioni on Twitter commenting on the case of the 38-year-old man who tested positive and is in critical prognosis at Codogno hospital.
IT_204	27	Lopalco While barroom virologists were disquisitioning on lethality and mortality, Sars-Cov2 was quietly going about its business.
IT_204	28	Don't say I didn't tell you.
IT_204	29	Epidemiologist Pierluigi Lopalco, a professor of Hygiene at the University of Pisa, wrote this on Twitter, commenting on the case of the 38-year-old man who tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to intensive care at Codogno Hospital.
IT_212	1	Lecce, the virus is smoldering under the radar.
IT_212	2	President Medical Association:
IT_212	3	The guard remains high
IT_212	4	The fire is smoldering under the ashes; we must not let our guard down.
IT_212	5	Donato De Giorgi president of the Lecce Medical Association has no doubts: the lockdown has stemmed the wave of Covid-19 infections here in the south, but the virus has not vanished into thin air.
IT_212	6	De Giorgi found himself in the trenches during the emergency; in fact, he is also head of the surgery department at the hospital in Copertino, a town considered by many to be the Codogno leccese.
IT_212	7	President,on this emergency the rampant infodemia makes it difficult to hold on to solid certainties.
IT_212	8	But certainty precisely, are there any?
IT_212	9	First certainty: the virus has not suddenly disappeared; one need only recall the dramatic situation that many countries in Europe, Asia and across the Atlantic are experiencing today.
IT_212	10	Second certainty: we should not think that the lokdown was useless: it allowed us to stop a raging wave to which we were unprepared and gave us the opportunity to reorganize.
IT_212	11	The current challenge, remembering that the fire is smoldering under the ashes, is the possibility of addressing limited outbreaks with a much higher and adequate sense of responsibility, knowledge and organization, integrating the efforts of citizens, communication potential, administrators and health workers.
IT_212	12	How to untangle the jungle of conflicting information circulating?
IT_212	13	Unfortunately, never before has uncertainty shaken even the scientific system, which is supposed to be the paradigm of certainties that cannot be questioned.
IT_212	14	It should be considered that many studies that have flourished in recent months are based on different standards and protocols from those to which we are accustomed by the more reliable scientific method.
IT_212	15	Often with the intent of sharing with the international scientific community as soon as possible often preliminary and partial results obtained on limited samples.
IT_212	16	This is at the root of a phenomenon we are experiencing in recent months.
IT_212	17	Meaning?
IT_212	18	Do you glare?
IT_212	19	Yes.
IT_212	20	Misconceptions even from authoritative scientific journals and organizations and contradictory opinions, which should not belong to the scientific method.
IT_212	21	What directives or recommendations will you make to your physicians in case of a second wave?
IT_212	22	Our recommendations cannot, of course, disregard the regional provisions of 22.05.2020 in this regard, but reiterate that a different way of working is needed, with telematic platforms and consultations in specific cases, telephone triage, and secure ways of prescription referral, in parallel with the usual care procedures: home and outpatient, but with stringent prudential precautions.
IT_212	23	Needed, therefore, is an interaction between hospital and territory.
IT_212	24	Of course.
IT_212	25	If the former has been an unwilling protagonist in the dark past months, today it is the territory where a difficult, treacherous, long guerrilla warfare will be fought, reserving for the hospital a safe rear-guard to guarantee the most complex and unmanageable cases at home: territory and hospital in harmony will no longer have to be diverted from the health care response in the acute, complexity and chronicity, in integrated roles.
IT_212	26	What about the special continuing care units (USCAs)?
IT_212	27	They absolutely must not be dismantled.
IT_212	28	On the contrary, they need to be increased and adequately supported; only then can they become the valuable first line in the diagnosis and treatment of doubtful or established cases, a decisive role especially in the fall when an explosive mixture of Covid recrudescence and seasonal flu will be highly likely, with diagnostic and therapeutic problems that are not easy.
IT_212	29	What do you recommend to citizens?
IT_212	30	In addition to repeated essential and responsible behaviors, it is urgent to properly inform them about the most appropriate use of health services.
IT_212	31	What do you want to add?
IT_212	32	We must never forget that we have paid a very high toll of infected doctors, and 171 colleagues have died while honoring a profession of service: a different way of working is necessary and necessary, I repeat.
IT_212	33	But I want to send a message.
IT_212	34	What message?
IT_212	35	We have vowed never to leave patients alone in the fragility of illness and never will, anyway.
IT_212	36	But never again should physicians be left alone in hospitals, in outpatient clinics, in the territory, in continuity of care in the emergency and urgent care system, without PPE, without adequate organization: we do not need rhetorical applause and gratitude, but respect for our moral role and knowledge.
IT_214	1	Omicron 5, Ema: okay for Pfizer vaccine in fall (but doses will arrive in November).
IT_214	2	What do we know
IT_214	3	The Covid vaccines adapted to Omicron , the most widely used version of subvariant 5, will not be distributed until late fall since just today Ema (European Medicines Agency) announced that authorization, however quick and expedited, is expected in the fall.
IT_214	4	Then taking into account the timing of distribution and administration, a mass vaccination for Omicron 5 will not arrive until October-November.
IT_214	5	Omicron 5 remains dominant (despite Centaurus) How come?
IT_214	6	In Europe, the Omicron 5 subvariant is now dominant, while the much-feared Centaurus (more correctly Omicron Ba.2.75) is not spreading, at least for now, proving to have more luck in media headlines (fascinated by the nickname Centaurus invented by a Twitter user) than in real life.
IT_214	7	Explains to AdnKronos Salute, Mauro Pistello, director of the virology unit at the University Hospital of Pisa and vice president of the Italian Society of Microbiology: The prevalence of Omicron subvariant BA.5 is over 80 percent; BA.4 comes in around 7 and BA.2 has virtually disappeared, around 2.
IT_214	8	The new subvariant BA.2.75, renamed Centaurus, does not break through: it is there, but remains confined to a few cases.
IT_214	9	We then recorded two very different subvariants of BA.5, which are at 5 percent: one, BE.1, we had also seen 2 weeks ago and we notice that it is showing up.
IT_214	10	At this point I think it is difficult for Centaurus to establish itself.
IT_214	11	This is at least the current situation.
IT_214	12	There remains, however, the need to curb Omicron 5, which, as a number of infected patients can testify, can also cause symptoms that are far from mild.
IT_214	13	The goal of the two pharmaceutical companies furthest along in the development of mRna vaccines-Pfizer-Biontech and Moderna-was to distribute them as early as the end of September, but the path will not be that simple.
IT_214	14	Pfizer-Biontech have already applied to Ema for approval of a bivalent Covid vaccine, which also covers Omicron, but in its initial version, Omicron 1.
IT_214	15	Given the prevalence of 5, even in light of a request from the Fda (the U.S. drug agency), however, further adaptation is being worked on.
IT_214	16	Clinical trials are ongoing, Ema assured a quick review, taking into account that in any case the core vaccine-the Covid vaccine-is already licensed and tested.
IT_214	17	Moderna's path is similar: the European Commission has signed an agreement that shifts delivery of new supplies from summer to fall-winter, and, Brussels explains, the understanding also covers vaccines adapted to the new BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron variants, which are awaiting Ema approval.
IT_214	18	The universal vaccine hypothesis.
IT_214	19	In the background, the search continues for a vaccine that covers all coronaviruses, without chasing variants.
IT_214	20	"But the success of this operation is not a foregone conclusion, although it is news these hours that scientists at the U.S. Scripps Research Institute have discovered ""pan-coronavirus"" antibodies in macaques that are effective against many different variants of Sars-CoV-2, but also against other Sars viruses such as Sars-CoV-1, the highly lethal pathogen responsible for the 2003 epidemic."
IT_214	21	This could facilitate the development of broad coverage vaccines.
IT_216	1	Died of ALS in a hospital bed from a lost paper
IT_216	2	A tragic story about how easy it is to die in a country where bureaucracy and malpractice go hand in hand.
IT_216	3	Dying far from home for a forgotten paper.
IT_216	4	"This is what happened to Massimo Rizzo, terminally ill with ALS , who died a year and 9 days ago. ""My husband would have died anyway,"" Assunta Cortellessa, his wife, tells Repubblica."
IT_216	5	"But what a pain to have had to chase a health ventilator that could have relieved his suffering."""
IT_216	6	Massimo's story is the tale of a pulmonary physician who died in a hospice with a hole in his throat, against his family members' wishes.
IT_216	7	Rizzo knew he would not have much time.
IT_216	8	And for this he had agreed to undergo tracheostomy .
IT_216	9	But on one condition: to spend the last days of his life at home, surrounded by the affection of his loved ones.
IT_216	10	"The patient, in order to be safely transported to his home, would have needed, however, two ventilators : ""He had only one,"" Assunta says, ""the other one, never arrived."
IT_216	11	At the root of it all is a communication gap.
IT_216	12	It was Dec. 19, 2018, when the resuscitation department of Sant'Eugenio sent a list of consumables needed for home care to the Prosthetic Medicine Department and the Ventilation Office of ASL Roma 2.
IT_216	13	Among them a paper.
IT_216	14	"""This list, however, never reached its destination."
IT_216	15	Or rather, the home care center (Cad) did not activate immediately.
IT_216	16	"And the file at the office in charge was never forwarded."""
IT_216	17	Except, then, to discover on Jan. 9 (the day before Rizzo's death) that the paper was stuck under the keyboard of a computer in the Asl Roma 2 office.
IT_216	18	To this must be added the year-end inventory closure of the company that was supposed to deliver home care equipment and supplies, and the concomitant Christmas holidays.
IT_216	19	For Assunta, the mistake Massimo made was that he found himself in that difficult situation right during the Christmas vacations.
IT_216	20	"""Every day, when we would go to St. Eugene's to visit him and enter the big room in the intensive care unit , Cleide and I,"" he says, ""promised him that we would take him home soon."
IT_216	21	But, sometimes, so mocking is life that it only takes a few coincidences to shatter the last wish of a life on its last legs.
IT_216	22	The file was eventually sent on January 9 last year, the same day the list was found.
IT_216	23	The delivery materials, however, arrived six days later, with the Christmas vacations over and Massimo's funeral having taken place.
IT_216	24	"A year later, the wife, lets go of a thought that fades into emotion: ""Filing a lawsuit against Asl Roma 2, for omission of official acts, would not bring my husband back."""
IT_219	1	Colorectal cancer: the new liquid biopsy that avoids unnecessary treatments
IT_219	2	Colorectal cancer, liquid biopsy guides therapy and spares patients unnecessary treatments.
IT_219	3	This is shown by the Italian Chronos study, coordinated by the Candiolo Institute IRCCS Fondazione del Piemonte per l'Oncologia (FPO) - IRCCS and Niguarda Hospital in Milan, with the collaboration of the University of Turin and the University of Milan and the clinical participation of the National Cancer Institute in Milan and the Veneto Oncology Institute in Padua.
IT_219	4	For the first time, researchers have used this technique as a measurement tool to figure out the right time to administer a second course of molecular-targeted therapy to patients with colorectal metastases.The work, just published in Nature Medicine , showed that real-time monitoring of tumor progress, through analysis of circulating tumor DNA, allows patients with gene mutations to be identified, avoiding a second course of treatment that may be unnecessary.
IT_219	5	The right choice at the right time.
IT_219	6	In short: choosing the right therapy, for the right patient, at the right time.
IT_219	7	Fundamental funding from Piedmont Foundation for Oncology IRCCS Candiolo IRCCS in the context of an AIRC 5x1000 research grant.
IT_219	8	"""In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, many molecularly targeted therapies are based on monoclonal antibodies against EGFR growth receptors, which can only be used in patients without mutations in RAS/BRAF,"" explains Professor Alberto Bardelli, co-author of the study from the IRCCS Candiolo Department of Oncology and professor at the University of Turin. ""Although the therapy is effective, most patients undergoing this treatment can develop drug resistance over time and the disease progresses."
IT_219	9	These patients can be given a second course of therapy, which consists of resuming anti-EGFR therapies after a period of discontinuation, once the mutated genes have disappeared and the disease has become sensitive to treatment again.
IT_219	10	"The difficulty, however, lies in figuring out when to start a second cycle."""
IT_219	11	Until now, it was not possible to determine this except empirically, based on a statistical time interval elapsed since previous therapy.
IT_219	12	This is the context for the Chronos study, which, for the first time, exploits the potential of liquid biopsy to monitor tumor progress in real time and guide therapy, allowing it to be excluded in patients with mutated genes in whom treatment would not work.
IT_219	13	Technique.
IT_219	14	"Liquid biopsy, through the analysis of a simple sample of the patient's blood, allows us to derive valuable information about the tumor and its development by ""hunting"" for the molecular traces released by circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream or DNA: laboratory analysis of these traces can detect, for example, the presence of specific alterations in the tumor's DNA that may affect the tumor's sensitivity or rather resistance to different therapeutic treatments."
IT_219	15	"""Thanks to liquid biopsy among patients without mutations who were enrolled in the study, 30 percent showed an objective response,"" adds Bardelli: a higher value than observed by selecting patients according to clinical criteria only."
IT_219	16	Stages.
IT_219	17	The Chronos clinical trial took place in the Oncology Department of Niguarda Hospital in Milan under the direction of Professor Salvatore Siena, of the University of Milan and director of the Niguarda Cancer Center, who coordinated the other participating clinical centers.
IT_219	18	In patients for whom a second course of anti-EGFR therapy was deemed suitable, a liquid biopsy was performed, and circulating tumor DNA was analyzed at the Candiolo Institute.
IT_219	19	If there were no resistance mutations, therapy with panitumumab, the drug used for the second cycle, was started.
IT_219	20	"""Overall,"" Bardelli concludes, ""this clinical trial represents the first integration of liquid biopsy to the treatment pathway in a big killer cancer such as colorectal cancer."
IT_219	21	From a drop of blood it is possible to decipher vulnerability to molecularly targeted therapy, the Chronos study paves the way for studies that take up this emerging challenge in personalized medicine.
IT_219	22	"Having a diagnostic tool that rules out surely ineffective treatments saves unnecessary toxicity and suffering."""
IT_223	1	Christmas, Super Green passes and buffers: here are the rules for dinner, travel and markets
IT_223	2	The watchword now is to secure Christmas .
IT_223	3	Last year was a decidedly subdued celebration, in the midst of lockdown, with distant families unable to move and join their loved ones and small groups at the table.
IT_223	4	The vaccine had not yet arrived in Italy, the high school had been closed for two months, and everything was stopped to avoid aggravating the situation.
IT_223	5	But for 2021, within the rules, a different Christmas can be experienced.
IT_223	6	I'M GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS WITH THE GREEN PASS.
IT_223	7	Among the first rules to be observed are movement: the current rule is to move without restriction between white and yellow zones.
IT_223	8	Currently the only region in
IT_223	9	is Friuli Venezia Giulia but others could be added.
IT_223	10	This does not detract from the fact that travel is permitted, subject to the need for the Green pass to board trains and planes.
IT_223	11	If, on the other hand, the trip for Christmas is made by car, there are no restrictions and it is possible to give a ride to non-cohabiting persons: the driver remains alone, sitting in the front, and the non-cohabiting person sits in the back, both with the requirement to wear a mask.
IT_223	12	If, on the other hand, you travel by public transportation such as Intecity or high-speed trains, interregional and regional trains, ships, ferries, airplanes, and regular buses, you must show the Green pass in the basic version.
IT_223	13	ALL TO THE TABLE FOR DINNER.
IT_223	14	For the time being, there are no formal guidelines regarding the maximum number of people at the table for Christmas or New Year's Eve dinner at home in the white or yellow zone.
IT_223	15	Barring any new last-minute measures, people will be able to meet and sit at the table even if they do not live together.
IT_223	16	Doctors always recommend wearing a mask indoors especially if there are grandparents or frail people.
IT_223	17	If, on the other hand, the dinner is held in an indoor restaurant in the yellow zone, the Super Green pass will be needed .
IT_223	18	Namely, the green pass obtained with the vaccine, which will go into effect on December 6.
IT_223	19	It will also be necessary to show it to gain access, perhaps on New Year's Eve , to theaters and cinemas.
IT_223	20	In case there should be any orange zones-for the time being, this is not planned-bars and restaurants can only do take-out food.
IT_223	21	CHRISTMAS MARKETS, THIS YEAR YOU CAN The traditional Christmas markets that warm up the Christmas season from North to South are back.
IT_223	22	Last year they were all cancelled, as is also happening now in Austria and Germany, but in Italy they will be done.
IT_223	23	In full compliance with the rules that will go into effect starting Dec. 6: one must always wear a mask in crowded places and display a green pass.
IT_223	24	There will be checkpoints at the entrance for green pass validity also with turnstiles and gates.
IT_223	25	There are also those who are arranging for wristbands, vacation village style, to leave the ability to enter and exit without further inspection to those who have already shown green certification.
IT_223	26	CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR IN THE SNOW.
IT_223	27	A white Christmas in its own right, that of 2021.
IT_223	28	In fact, ski weeks on the slopes will also return to celebrate Christmas and New Year .
IT_223	29	To access the facilities you will need the basic green pass in the white and yellow zones, that is, the one you can get with the vaccine but also with the swab, while if you decide to go to a possible orange zone you will need the enhanced green pass, that is, the one from vaccine.
IT_223	30	Cable cars and gondolas will travel at 80 percent of capacity, and goggles will be mandatory, while chairlifts and ski lifts, while having mandatory goggles, will not have capacity limits.
IT_223	31	MIDNIGHT IN THE SQUARE.
IT_223	32	For the time being, there are no restrictions on street parties on New Year's Eve, as these are events held outdoors.
IT_223	33	With the understanding that it is up to mayors to organize and then authorize such events.
IT_235	1	Pd, Third Pole and Italian Left against government decisions on landings.
IT_235	2	"Dems: ""Policies of the worst right."""
IT_235	3	Bonaccini:
IT_235	4	"""The government explain in the Conference of Regions."""
IT_235	5	Oppositions on the attack over the government's move to land migrants rescued by NGOs at ports in cities administered by the center-left.
IT_235	6	From the PD, through the Third Pole, to the Italian Left, the strategy is criticized.
IT_235	7	"from Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi Stefano Bonaccini , governor of Emilia Romagna and candidate for the Pd secretariat, demands ""clarity"" from the executive branch:"
IT_235	8	"""At the Conference of Regions, we are to be explained the plan for the coming months."""
IT_235	9	"While for Dem MP Filippo Sensi, ""the government's choice to send ships to cities led by the Democratic Party is taken from the script of the worst American right-wing."""
IT_235	10	"""It's quite a curious government because it's sending ships with migrants to ports far from where they could dock and drop off people coming from places of desperation and sending them to ports in municipalities all governed by the center left,"" Bonaccini insists."
IT_235	11	"We,"" he adds, ""host everyone as we did in Ravenna in my region, as they will do in Ancona and as is usually done around here."
IT_235	12	"However, it is clear that we want to understand what game is being played because after saying 'ports closed and Italians first,' today they are coming down to the real land and knowing that these people have to be disembarked so that no one dies at sea."""
IT_235	13	If it were possible, Piantedosi, Meloni, and Salvini would assign Bolzano or Tarvisio as a landing site for #Ong ships rescuing shipwrecked people in the Central Mediterranean in order to slow down humanitarian rescue efforts.
IT_235	14	2023 edition of the banality of evil
IT_235	15	"According to Benedetto Della Vedova , secretary of +Europa, Piantedosi should ""clarify as soon as possible,"" because ""if it were true that the government and interior minister chose ports on the basis of the color of the administrations, it would be of enormous institutional disloyalty, as well as inhumane,"" he says when interviewed on La7."
IT_235	16	"Pd MP Rachele Scarpa speaks of an ""unmentionable and baffling"" attitude."
IT_235	17	"The executive,"" says the Dem member, ""makes life impossible for those who save lives at sea (thus tragically making it more likely that men women and children will drown) while at the same time, with a sly, slimy manner, directing ships and migrants only to cities ruled by the center-left."
IT_235	18	"Speaking to Sky, Isabella Paita , group leader of the Third Pole Senate, argues that the ""strategy followed on ngos is not appropriate: it creates tensions without going to solve the problem."
IT_235	19	"Italy plays an important and delicate role in the Mediterranean, it cannot be left alone but it is not by breaking relations with European allies that problems are solved."""
IT_235	20	"According to the Italia Viva member, ""the government is not addressing the central nodes of the migration issue."
IT_235	21	"Dublin Treaty, which needs to be changed, and deep cooperation with European countries."""
IT_235	22	"Nicola Fratoianni , secretary of the Italian Left, also intervened: ""I imagine that if it were possible, Piantedosi, Meloni and Salvini would assign Bolzano or Tarvisio, or any other place as far away as possible as a landing site for NGO ships rescuing shipwrecked people in the Central Mediterranean, in order to slow down the humanitarian rescue effort."""
IT_236	1	Piedmont, open doors to refugees from Ukraine
IT_236	2	"""Doors open to those fleeing war."""
IT_236	3	It is thus, without hesitation, that Turin and Piedmont huddle around Ukraine.
IT_236	4	Within hours of the attack by Russian troops, the territory's main institutional bodies--about 20,000 Ukrainian citizens live in the region--have made their closeness to the warring state heard, saying they are willing to offer any support that may be needed.
IT_236	5	"This was also the meaning of the words of the governor of Piedmont Alberto Cirio, on the sidelines of the presentation of the Festival of Economy: ""I heard the first adviser of the Ukrainian ambassador to Italy and, in addition to solidarity, I gave him the full availability of Piedmont: if something concrete has to be done for the hosting of refugees, they can count on our region."
IT_236	6	"Doors always open to those fleeing war."""
IT_236	7	"Words that go hand in hand with those uttered by the mayor of Turin, Stefano Lo Russo: ""We make ourselves immediately available."
IT_236	8	"I think this is a particularly sensitive time for the European Union, and that is why the City will do everything it can to facilitate the arrival of refugees from Ukraine."""
IT_236	9	"Much, the first citizen explained, will depend on how the situation develops in the coming days: ""At the moment we have not had any specific requests but the City's readiness for the refugee reception system is total."""
IT_236	10	"Lo Russo, who in his professional capacity as a professor at the Polytechnic in the past has had numerous fruitful relations with the Russian Federation, added about the sanctions, ""They will also affect our companies that collaborate with the country and export."
IT_236	11	"But at this time the West needs to show unity, and I think it is imperative to give a firm signal with respect to a method that cannot be the method by which certain types of conflicts are resolved."""
IT_236	12	"Regional Council President Stefano Allasia calls the invasion of Ukraine ""an unacceptable violation of the sovereignty of a free and independent country."
IT_236	13	"We remain available to give support to the Ukrainian people residing in Piedmont."""
IT_236	14	Total solidarity also came from academia.
IT_236	15	"In a shared note, the University of Turin, Polytechnic University, University of Gastronomic Sciences, and University of Eastern Piedmont-all four universities are part of the ""Network of Universities for Peace""-expressed ""great concern about the conflict"" and ""the strongest condemnation of the use of violence and war."""
IT_236	16	Also.
IT_236	17	"""We hope,"" the universities emphasize, ""that this conflict can come to an end as soon as possible, and we are working to turn our concern into concrete action."
IT_236	18	"We are taking action to provide shelter for colleagues and colleagues affected by the conflict and to enable them to work in a safe environment, and we are working to similarly support students and female students affected by the war."""
IT_236	19	Finally, in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, the Cinema Museum on yesterday evening decided to cancel the retrospective devoted to Russian director, producer and screenwriter Karen Shakhnazarov, born in 1952, scheduled to run at the Massimo Cinema until Feb. 27.
IT_237	1	Hacking and sites piloted by Russian government: Facebook, Instagram and Twitter run for cover
IT_237	2	A Facebook spokesperson also clarified that computer-generated faces were used to bolster the credibility of fake editorials on several platforms, including Instagram.
IT_237	3	The other disinformation channel used hacked accounts to promote anti-Ukrainian propaganda and was linked to a well-known Belarusian hacker group.
IT_237	4	Experts have warned that Russia may continue to try to manipulate narratives about Ukraine, particularly around statements made by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
IT_237	5	THE NETWORKS Removed Facebook and Twitter networks have stymied reports that Putin himself mentioned in his speech when announcing a military operation that has since turned into a full-scale invasion.
IT_237	6	The announcement also shows that Russia continues to use disinformation strategies that were first uncovered years ago around the 2016 election, albeit with some advances, particularly in the use of software that can create realistic and original human faces.
IT_237	7	"The larger of the two disinformation groups operating in Russia, as well as in the Russian-dominated Ukrainian regions of Donbas and Crimea,"" said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy at Meta, ""is linked to the News Front and South Front websites, which the U.S. government highlighted as part of a larger disinformation effort that had links to Russian intelligence."
IT_237	8	(Meta is the parent company of Facebook).
IT_237	9	Gleicher said in an interview that the propaganda campaign has been able to publish stories on the Internet that Ukraine's effort is not paying off and pretending to give these news stories signed by Kiev-based journalists.
IT_237	10	These disinformation media are trying to undermine trust in the Ukrainian government and talk about a failed state; they say the war is going very badly in Ukraine and try to praise Russia.
IT_237	11	Facebook had removed profiles related to News Front and South Front back in 2020, and the company confirmed to NBC News that the new group has connections to accounts that were previously banned.
IT_237	12	Both websites published misleading articles, even questioning the results of the 2020 presidential election and the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.
IT_237	13	The sites contained articles about, for example, Zelensky building a neo-Nazi dictatorship in Ukraine.
IT_237	14	BANNED SITES Facebook removed 40 profiles linked to the disinformation operation, saying they were a small part of a larger personality-building operation that spread across Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and Russian social networks.
IT_237	15	Website-related accounts were still active last Sunday on Telegram, Russian social networks, and YouTube.
IT_237	16	Twitter, for its part, said it had banned more than a dozen accounts linked to Operation News Front and South Front Russian that were creating links to a new propaganda site called Ukraine Today.
IT_237	17	On February 27, we permanently deleted more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links in violation of our platform manipulation and spam policy.
IT_237	18	"Our investigation is ongoing,"" said a Twitter spokesperson, ""However, our initial findings indicate that the accounts and links originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."
IT_237	19	THE HACKERS In addition, a group of hackers targeted journalists, military personnel and local government officials in Ukraine, using compromised e-mail accounts and passwords to access their Facebook profiles.
IT_237	20	The hacked accounts would even post a video of what they said was a Ukrainian waving a white flag of surrender.
IT_237	21	Facebook attributed this hack to the Ghostwriter group that previously used hacked accounts to promote disinformation in favor of the Belarusian government.
IT_237	22	"As for the next targets, Renée DiResta, head of research at Stanford's Internet Observatory, said it is ""unlikely"" that they will be U.S. users: What is seen online is most likely the work of real influencers who are part of the propaganda sphere that Russia already possesses for some time."
IT_237	23	Creating a fake account is not that easy and needs a lot of work.
IT_238	1	Secret Service, a new law to give more powers to Italian 007s:
IT_238	2	yes to undercover roles
IT_238	3	Maybe they won't be jumping on moving trains and sipping Vodka martinis in the middle of a gunfight.
IT_238	4	Certainly, however, for Italian 007s a new era now opens.
IT_238	5	Among the folds of the dl-Aiuti bis just approved by the Senate is in fact an amendment that promises to revolutionize our intelligence sector.
IT_238	6	It bears the signature of , an FdI senator and Copasir chairman, but has garnered bipartisan support.
IT_238	7	The rule inserted at the photo finish (Art. 42) allows Aise , the Foreign Service agency, to employ its own personnel to carry out intelligence research and operations abroad.
IT_238	8	LAW.
IT_238	9	"A green light for undercover operations : from now on, Aise agents can act as ""infiltrators"" in foreign countries."
IT_238	10	A decisive turning point and not at all a foregone conclusion.
IT_238	11	Of course, Italian intelligence operatives have always been able to gather information and carry out missions abroad.
IT_238	12	And in some countries considered strategic to Rome, from Libya to Iraq , Italy is also present in force with its fake beards.
IT_238	13	In Afghanistan , for example, the Italian intelligence informant network was second only to the American one.
IT_238	14	There is one obstacle, however: until now, agents could only operate as accredited officials at the embassy on duty.
IT_238	15	A lace that over time proved too tight.
IT_238	16	Hence the intervention to loosen it.
IT_238	17	Undercover operations are a must in espionage that the planet's major intelligence agencies, from the CIA to the KGB, have resorted to for decades.
IT_238	18	And they have always fascinated the public imagination thanks to infiltrated spies who have become iconic, from the dancer Mata Hari to the Israeli agent Eli Cohen, from Julius Rosenberg, the American who leaked atomic information to Moscow during the Cold War, to Lawrence D'Arabia.
IT_238	19	Not to mention the eternal movie spy in the service of Her Majesty, James Bond.
IT_238	20	With the new standard, Italy shortens the gap and catches up with a long delay .
IT_238	21	Italian 007s will now be able to go hunting for sensitive information - they will need direct authorization from the Prime Minister or the Delegated Authority without accrediting themselves in the embassy as commercial or military attachés.
IT_238	22	They will do it in other guises.
IT_238	23	So an agent, explains those familiar with the dossier, can pose as an expert barber or a celebrity chef working in a restaurant in downtown Moscow, Seoul, Tehran.
IT_238	24	Preparation will take time and could be taken care of by the Dis School of Training , the department that coordinates 007s headed by Elisabetta Belloni .
IT_238	25	This is an important new development, which signals that Italy is still focusing on 'humint (human intelligence),' reflects Adriano Soi, professor at the University of Florence and former director of communications at the Dis, but it also means boosting Aise manpower abroad.
IT_238	26	Although in the digital age these missions present risks, notes Antonio Teti , professor of Information Systems at the University of Chieti-Pescara: A fake passport is not enough when at airports around the world a camera thanks to AI can recognize the face of any passerby.
IT_238	27	Very technical preparation will be needed.
IT_238	28	ITER.
IT_238	29	An intervention that has been desired by the industry for years.
IT_238	30	And defended among others by former President of the Republic Francesco Cossiga and then by Massimo D'Alema at the time of the Copasir presidency.
IT_238	31	Now a first brick has been laid, but the dossier must soon land on the desk of Palazzo San Macuto.
IT_238	32	Because it will be the implementing decrees and regulations that will govern very precisely when and how Italian 007s can lend themselves to such operations.
IT_238	33	Just as the details of another provision in Dl-Aiuti bis that requires intelligence to take a quantum leap must be worked out.
IT_238	34	And that is the green light for the adoption of law enforcement intelligence measures in the cyber sphere.
IT_238	35	Translated: not only will the Italian Services have the means to defend the country against cyber attacks but they will be able, in some cases, to launch preemptive attacks against threats.
IT_240	1	Russia, borders to Asia stormed, fleeing Putin's war:
IT_240	2	"""I'm 26 years old, I don't want to die."""
IT_240	3	In a speech broadcast on national TV on Sept. 21, the Russian president announced the partial mobilization.
IT_240	4	Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu added that only those with combat and service experience and not conscripts and students would be mobilized.
IT_240	5	In fact, reports are coming in of mass conscription: with ethnic minorities seemingly being targeted, as they have been since Feb. 24 onward.
IT_240	6	What is it and how, then, is this partial mobilization taking place?
IT_240	7	At the moment it is chaos, as according to Novaja Gazeta already 260,000 people have fled, left Russia to avoid being drafted.
IT_240	8	There are long lines at borders with countries where Russian citizens can still cross the border without showing a visa.
IT_240	9	All this is happening as reports chase each other that Moscow may soon close the exits-at least to men of fighting age.
IT_240	10	Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty wrote that in Oral, a Kazakh town, an entire cinema was opened to shelter some 200 Russians over the last weekend.
IT_240	11	RFE/RL correspondents saw local residents handing out free rice bowls to Russians gathering at the city's train station.
IT_240	12	We help them as we can.
IT_240	13	If we could do more, we would, said one volunteer.
IT_240	14	We will always accept you, always treat you kindly, he told them, reports the news site.
IT_240	15	But there are also protests: groups of Kazakhs are demanding that the authorities close the borders so that no more Russians can pass through.
IT_240	16	I spoke to over a dozen Russian men who had left the country since Russia announced its mobilization https://t.co/ynxQfeyzan Anastasia Tenisheva (@tenisheva_a) September 26, 2022 The Kazakh authorities admitted that in recent days the flows of Russians-both inbound and outbound-were two to three times higher than last year's levels.
IT_240	17	Russians can stay in this country for up to 30 days without registration and for another 60 days after that, but a note from their national government is required to apply for an extension of residency.
IT_240	18	On Sept. 26, Kazakhstan released draft changes to laws that would prevent foreigners using domestic passports-rather than foreigners-from staying longer than 30 days.
IT_240	19	Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev said on Sept. 27 that most Russians arriving in his country are forced to leave because of the current desperate situation.
IT_240	20	We must take care of them and ensure their safety.
IT_240	21	Another RFE/RL correspondent met two fugitives, both in their 20s in Tajikistan.
IT_240	22	He writes that they said they left their hometown, about 150 kilometers southwest of Moscow, after Putin's announcement.
IT_240	23	I don't want to be sent to Ukraine, I don't want to be killed or lose a limb.
IT_240	24	I am only 26 years old, said one of the two.
IT_240	25	The two were headed to Uzbekistan.
IT_240	26	In Kyrgyzstan, a hotel owner told Current Time that he made repeated trips to the city airport to pick up his new clients.
IT_240	27	"He explained that if in March the arrivals referred to in the jargon as ""relocators"" were ""hipsters, computer scientists, from St. Petersburg, from Moscow,"" now they are ""anyone who has the opportunity,"" Voitenko noted."
IT_240	28	"If in March the Russians leaving were ""hipsters and IT people,"" now it is ""anyone with the opportunity,"" said one hotel owner. https://t.co/mp8qJyIP3d Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (@RFERL)"
IT_242	1	"Di Maio: ""With Lavrov reaffirmed willingness for dialogue and cooperation."
IT_242	2	"Moscow key player in managing the crisis in Afghanistan"""
IT_242	3	Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov left Palazzo Chigi after meeting with Prime Minister Mario Draghi.
IT_242	4	The motorcade entered around 10:30 a.m. and left, again through the rear entrance of the government building, after about 45 minutes.
IT_242	5	"The two spoke about Libya where there is a ""need to continue with the political dialogue promoted in Geneva by the United Nations also in view of the elections at the end of December and the need for a rapid withdrawal of foreign forces from the country."""
IT_242	6	Lavrov then met with Luigi Di Maio.
IT_242	7	"""We haven't talked about the sanctions, there is nothing strange because we have said repeatedly that we don't intend to talk about them with countries that suffer from these sanctions."
IT_242	8	"I came to Italy because I was invited and we always value mutually respectful dialogue,"" Russian Foreign Minister Serghei Lavrov said at a press conference at the Farnesina with Luigi Di Maio."
IT_242	9	"Close ""international coordination on Afghanistan is essential."
IT_242	10	"In this context, dialogue with Russia is indispensable,"" the foreign minister says, calling Moscow ""a key player in managing the crisis."""
IT_242	11	"""With Minister Lavrov we reiterated our willingness to dialogue and cooperate at this extremely sensitive stage on the international agenda,"" Di Maio said during a joint press point at the Farnesina with his Russian counterpart."
IT_242	12	Harsh condemnation of Kabul attacks.
IT_242	13	"""In the coming hours, with the conclusion of the airlift and evacuation operations, the first emergency phase will be concluded."
IT_242	14	"We need to plan now for phase 2, looking beyond the August 31 date to field a response in the short to medium term that is orderly, structured and strategic in nature."""
IT_242	15	The Foreign Ministry is working to coordinate a plan to support the Afghan people in the future.
IT_242	16	"""The priority is the greatest number of evacuations to protect the greatest number of civilians."""
IT_242	17	"Only ""a unified international approach will be effective toward the new authorities in Kabul,"" Di Maio stressed."
IT_242	18	"At the press conference, Minister Di Maio announced that Italy, as part of its G20 presidency, is planning an in-depth ad hoc summit on Afghanistan, adding that it is counting on Russia's ""cooperation."""
IT_242	19	"And Russian Foreign Minister Serghei Lavrov said that ""Italy's presidency in the G20 offers an opportunity to intensify our mutual cooperation."""
IT_242	20	"""Unlike the G7, the G20 is a platform that reflects the multipolar reality of our world,"" he added."
IT_242	21	"Di Maio: ""Concern over the case of Alexei Navalny"" The joint press conference between Di Maio and Lavrov was also an opportunity for the Italian foreign minister to remind his Russian colleague of ""our concern over the case of Alexei Navalny, to whom legitimate safeguards to protect fundamental rights must be applied,"" adding that between friendly countries it is necessary to speak frankly with each other."
IT_242	22	The holder of the Foreign Ministry also raised the issue of the Ukrainian crisis.
IT_M_012	1	At the same time, we must firmly focus on a project of integration, rationalization and coordination of European security and defense policy, enhancing the strategic autonomy of the European Union.
IT_M_012	2	"With the approval of the new ""Strategic Compass,"" the EU has more firmly taken on the prospect of building a Common Defense."
IT_M_012	3	This is a point we believe is decisive for Europe to be increasingly influential in the global context.
IT_M_012	4	"It is clear that a Common Defense cannot be reduced to being identified exclusively with a ""Common Army."""
IT_M_012	5	There needs to be a shared threat analysis, a European agenda, and joint management of tools and resources.
IT_M_012	6	An all-political, before military, choice.
IT_M_012	7	We want to revive Europe's role as the main driver of a fairer globalization based on high social and environmental standards.
IT_M_012	8	We pledge to promote the adoption of a minimum global tax on multinational companies (Minimum Global Tax), as proposed by the OECD and the G20, as well as to support the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), so that our industrial fabric is put in a position to be able to invest in the green transition, without suffering unfair competition from foreign companies subject to less stringent environmental standards.
IT_M_012	9	At the same time, we believe it is important to introduce sanctions on companies that fail to take concrete measures against child labor, forced labor and human trafficking in global supply chains, ensuring the implementation of international conventions on decent work and human rights.
IT_M_012	10	Italy has a tradition of commitment, which we want to continue, to the protection of peace and security at the global level, through contributions to international missions in many sensitive realities.
IT_M_012	11	A commitment that we are recognized by institutions and especially by the people in the areas where we have a presence.
IT_M_017	1	The first pillar is the one that groups sustainable development and transitions, digital and green.
IT_M_017	2	Italy has been hit by 5 major crises in the last 15 years: the economic-financial and sovereign debt crisis, the migrant crisis, the pandemic, Putin's war with its economic and energy consequences, and the climate crisis.
IT_M_017	3	These are all caesuras that have made us live through years of permanent emergency and have inevitably impoverished and made our country more fragile.
IT_M_017	4	The ecological transition represents a great opportunity to modernize Italy and redirect its development trajectory to a scenario of sustainability.
IT_M_017	5	The challenge of combating climate change should not be fought defensively.
IT_M_017	6	On the contrary, we must have the strength to make a paradigm shift, to build a model that looks to the interests not only of individual economic actors, but of the community as a whole, of today and future generations.
IT_M_017	7	We must act now.
IT_M_017	8	The images of this summer show this: heat waves and extreme drought clearly indicate how the future of our planet, our social welfare and our economy are inextricably linked.
IT_M_017	9	Slowing down on the environmental transition front (or worse yet stopping) is not an option.
IT_M_017	10	Because it would mean helplessly accepting the increase in environmental catastrophes, such as those already experienced in recent years, from the Marmolada glacier collapse to last fall's floods.
IT_M_017	11	Because it would mean turning so many areas of our country, starting with the most concrete areas of big cities, into unlivable places.
IT_M_017	12	Because it would mean condemning to backwardness so many businesses that are already suffering the ravages of climate change or competition from more advanced foreign countries on the green innovation front.
IT_M_017	13	The European FitFor55 package, with its goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, has clearly indicated what the path forward is.
IT_M_017	14	We need to set realistic but ambitious climate targets, putting in place instruments that can ensure a socially equitable transition and strengthen the innovation and competitiveness of our industry.
IT_M_017	15	We want to pursue our goals in the wake of a strengthened international commitment, because climate is a global challenge.
IT_M_017	16	If a change of pace has been achieved in recent years, in Italy and around the world, it is because the Paris Agreement on climate change has provided a common framework for action, within which governments, businesses and investors have been able to navigate.
IT_M_017	17	The Inflation Reduction Act sought by President Biden includes an investment of more than $370 billion in climate and energy programs and will enable the U.S. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels.
IT_M_017	18	This is a historic decision for the United States.
IT_M_017	19	International environmental cooperation does not grow by waiting for others' commitments, but by decisive choices, even unilateral ones, that change perspective and encourage change, in a scenario of virtuous imitation.
IT_M_017	20	Europe today is called upon to take leadership in these paradigm shifts.
IT_M_017	21	Therefore, only a political force open to the values of multilateralism and cooperation can be able to advance a real agenda for ecological transition in Italy as well.
IT_M_017	22	Now we must act to transform and make the entire productive and social fabric of the country more solid.
IT_M_017	23	"We want to strengthen the great potential of our businesses, small and women entrepreneurs, innovative start-ups, the world of artisans and professionals, through support and simplification measures, encouraging the ""4.0 transition"" in a scenario that combines innovation, competition and sustainability."
IT_M_017	24	"We want to invest in research and innovation to overcome the inefficiencies and structural problems of low productivity in the ""Italian System."""
IT_M_017	25	We want to take action on reducing household and business energy costs through concrete proposals capable of giving a decisive boost to clean and renewable sources.
IT_M_017	26	Caring for the land also involves the enhancement of protected areas and the protection of biodiversity.
IT_M_017	27	The infrastructure and sustainable mobility investments initiated by the Draghi government will need to be supplemented with new land-cover projects.
IT_M_017	28	We aim to introduce drought plans and design agriculture, livestock and fisheries as drivers of the ecological transition, including by enhancing the digitization of tracking and monitoring processes.
IT_M_017	29	We want to simplify and make taxation fairer and more progressive for families and businesses, in a scenario of incentives that favor green and digital transition.
IT_M_017	30	We want to remove obstacles that hold back households and businesses from migrating to current and future ultra-wideband connectivity networks and to the full deployment of digital skills and services, including those offered by the Public Administration.
IT_M_017	31	The green transition should not be experienced defensively.
IT_M_017	32	Instead, it is an opportunity for a paradigm shift.
IT_M_017	33	Investing now, starting today, in clean energy is three times strategic.
IT_M_017	34	First, because it counteracts climate change by lowering CO2 emissions.
IT_M_017	35	Second, because it structurally cuts the price of utility bills for households and businesses and creates new jobs.
IT_M_017	36	Third, because it strengthens our national security by reducing dependence on the import of fossil fuels from abroad.
IT_M_020	1	On schools, it should be noted that Italy lags far behind, with wide gaps between different areas of the country.
IT_M_020	2	Thus, there emerges an urgent need for action to provide quality education for all.
IT_M_020	3	Knowledge is constantly being renewed, and the school, like the university, must be dynamic and be part of the debate about ongoing cultural developments in the humanities, science and society.
IT_M_020	4	That is why we must first of all continue on the path taken with the Conte II government, during which we allocated 10 billion, the largest investment in schools in 30 years.
IT_M_020	5	A substantial increase in investment in the education sector is needed when fully operational.
IT_M_020	6	Countering educational poverty:
IT_M_020	7	educating communities
IT_M_020	8	Because of the pandemic, there is a high risk that our children will serve two years of educational poverty.
IT_M_020	9	Therefore, it is necessary to orient the Italian school in a new perspective.
IT_M_020	10	It is important to establish an educational endowment in synergy with educational community pacts aimed primarily at neighborhood and suburban schools, which most of all must guarantee personalized educational and cultural services for the disadvantaged group of pupils, in close cooperation with the social policy offices of local governments.
IT_M_020	11	Educating communities can become a structural measure to counter educational and cultural poverty with direct outdoor experiences, sports disciplines, artistic-creative skills, civic and vocational education.
IT_M_020	12	School well-being
IT_M_020	13	Teams of school psychologists, educators and pedagogists need to be created who, divesting their function in counter mode, become structural figures supporting the school community.
IT_M_020	14	This is especially important at this time in history when individual problems related to depression, violence, and lack of a suitable climate for their growth and learning are increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents.
IT_M_020	15	School construction and logistics
IT_M_020	16	We need to rethink school construction, hypothesizing a five-year plan of intervention, also with the aim of combating overcrowded classrooms, without decreasing the workforce rather strengthening it (both in the teaching and ATA components).
IT_M_020	17	The plan will have to include interventions made with new materials and new energy systems using for this, for example, the 2.2 billion from the NRP and the RePower EU funds to establish energy communities (taking advantage of the more than 8000 roofs of educational institutions).
IT_M_020	18	School buildings should become proximity facilities, especially in large cities, thus giving students the opportunity to walk to school in a short time and, in case of need, have dedicated transportation available: car sharing involving family groups, reserved buses, enhancement of public and private networks and transportation.
IT_M_020	19	School organization
IT_M_020	20	We propose the strengthening of full-time (5 days a week) throughout the country, with an investment that expands afternoon and canteen offerings, coupled with an appropriate education program on proper nutrition.
IT_M_020	21	We are fully committed to keeping schools open even with a small number of pupils and to ensuring that the entire schooling (from 0 to 18 years old) is free.
IT_M_020	22	There is a need to increase the presence of workshops using innovative teaching materials from the most advanced pedagogical experiences.
IT_M_020	23	"The ""Connected Schools"" program will evolve into the ""Single Network of Schools"" in order to ensure excellent services to support education with 135 million already allocated but not yet used, moving toward digital educational platforms also publicly owned."
IT_M_020	24	School facilities that are not used at certain times should be put at the service of the community to foster cultural and sports offerings for the entire population, including adults, and with lifelong learning programs, also dedicated to citizenship income recipients and retired and elderly people.
IT_M_020	25	In addition to construction, there also needs to be a substantial economic investment in civic education to educate new generations for a world that will require new patterns of living, consumption, saving, self-production, and work.
IT_M_020	26	The issues of ecological transition, already initiated by the M5S with the School Regeneration plan, but also of digital transition by fostering the development of awareness to direct such transitions to humanity and its development should also be taken into account in educational planning.
IT_M_020	27	Certainly, students must be guaranteed the opportunity to acquire advanced digital and computer skills.
IT_M_020	28	But the training of students cannot be exhausted in such skills.
IT_M_020	29	That is why we propose, alongside the development of skills related to problem solving and research mechanisms, greater attention to the teaching of the Italian language, history and geography also as elements that foster social cohesion and integration, the inclusion of art history and music history in all middle and high school curricula, and ensuring a music and art section for every school in the first cycle, thus helping to strengthen the entire system of High Artistic, Musical and Choreographic Education.
IT_M_021	1	Immigration is an ever-growing global and epochal phenomenon that cannot be stopped, but must be curbed and managed with common-sense solutions and good policy.
IT_M_021	2	Wars, persecution, hunger and poverty, and climate change are forcing millions of people to move in search of better living conditions.
IT_M_021	3	Those who escape these conditions will face any sea and cross any wall: that is why physical barriers are not the solutions.
IT_M_021	4	The phenomenon must be managed with intelligence and vision, within a perspective of integration and inclusion.
IT_M_021	5	Social inclusion cannot disregard the strengthening of literacy services and learning of the Italian language and culture in favor of foreign citizens legally present in the national territory.
IT_M_021	6	A good policy must look not only downstream but also upstream of migration, working to remove its political and socioeconomic causes in countries of origin and fighting human traffickers in transit countries.
IT_M_021	7	This means being able to intervene on multiple levels.
IT_M_021	8	To initiate a policy of cooperation, within the EU, to foster stabilization, democratization and economic development in the countries of origin of the flows in Africa (Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Eritrea, Ivory Coast) and in the Middle East/Asia (Afghanistan, Syria, Bangladesh, Pakistan) in order to ensure better living conditions for local populations.
IT_M_021	9	"In order to avoid ""giving with one hand and taking away with the other,"" this policy of cooperation presupposes the cessation of any relationship of support for undemocratic regimes, any sale of armaments that may fuel conflicts, and any policy of predatory exploitation of local economic resources."
IT_M_021	10	Long-term prevention is not enough: immediate emergencies must also be addressed.
IT_M_021	11	Where extraordinary situations (wars, natural disasters, economic crises) occur, it is necessary for the EU to resort to opening humanitarian corridors and legal channels of entry into Europe, modeled after what was done for Ukrainian refugees.
IT_M_021	12	"Downstream, that is, for the management of migratory flows as they arrive in our countries, it is now imperative to launch a new European policy on immigration that starts with overcoming the Dublin Treaties and thus the unacceptable principle of the ""country of first arrival"" having to take charge of reception."
IT_M_021	13	Italy can no longer be left alone by Europe to welcome those who land on the European shores of our peninsula fleeing war, persecution, hunger and poverty.
IT_M_021	14	"Nor can voluntary redistribution agreements suffice, much less if they are limited only to ""rescued at sea"" (thus excluding all those who land independently) and only to ""refugees"" entitled to 'asylum - who should therefore first be identified in Italy (thus excluding the majority of migrants, the so-called ""economic migrants"")."
IT_M_021	15	Therefore, the only effective solution is a European agreement for a generalized and immediate redistribution (for all incoming migrants without distinction, not after identification in the country of disembarkation) and of a binding nature with the provision of sanctions for countries that do not comply with national quotas, established according to criteria of fair and sustainable distribution.
IT_M_021	16	Quotas that also cover economic migrants that each country can and has an interest in absorbing into its labor market.
IT_M_021	17	Equally necessary is for the EU-not individual member states-to sign agreements with the countries of origin, including agreements that allow for the automatic and immediate repatriation of their nationals who are not entitled to humanitarian protection or who are not covered by work quotas.
IT_M_029	1	DEFENSE The democratic culture of diplomacy and dialogue the only weapon against wars
IT_M_029	2	Italy can and must once again become a major player in international politics not only because it is favored by its central geographic position in the Mediterranean and the Balkans but also by virtue of Italy's negotiating capacity to build and maintain peace in its neighboring countries.
IT_M_029	3	This requires new agreements that strengthen Italy's economic, energy and strategic ties with neighboring foreign countries, including binding guarantees such as combating terrorism and irregular immigration.
IT_M_029	4	At the international and multilateral level, we need to restore an order based on stability and economic balance, without foreign meddling but composed of determined alliances such as the Atlantic Alliance.
IT_M_029	5	Finally, in Italy's outward projection, special attention will be paid to reconnect and protect with urgent initiatives the important Italian community abroad.
IT_M_029	6	ITALY NEGOTIATOR AND PROMOTER COUNTRY FOR PEACE TALKS Italy must put itself forward as a negotiator and moderator of conflicts and tensions in its foreign neighbors, taking an active role in building and preserving peace and security.
IT_M_029	7	In addition to actively working toward a lasting ceasefire and a peace agreement that is an acceptable compromise between Ukraine and Russia, Italy must participate in moderating the growing tensions in the Balkans and consolidating real peace in post-conflict countries such as Armenia and Azerbaijan by participating in negotiating tables from which it has so far been excluded.
IT_M_029	8	Italy has economic relations and historic ties with all countries in the European neighborhood and must implement them with targeted political action.
IT_M_029	9	In addition to its neighboring foreign countries, Italy must maintain a high focus in the Indo-Pacific, a key region for future global decisions, with direct repercussions for our country as well.
IT_M_029	10	Italy must become the bridge to third countries on behalf of NATO and Europe, assuming the role as one of the West's main interlocutors and, in certain conflict situations, cooperating with the UN to work on regional and global crises.
IT_M_029	11	PROPOSALS Promote, in connection with the war in Ukraine, a major peace conference to redefine interests and rules of peaceful coexistence
IT_M_029	12	Promote on the continental security front greater cooperation between armies of European countries
IT_M_029	13	ITALY REGIONAL POWER IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
IT_M_029	14	Italy needs to strengthen its presence and influence in the Mediterranean basin by effectively renewing cooperation and signing agreements on the repatriation of irregular migrants with all non-EU countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, from Turkey to Morocco, via other states such as Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia.
IT_M_029	15	After years of leftist governments that have relegated Italy to being a second-class player in the Mediterranean, the League wants to protect national interests that have great reach in neighboring countries in the wider Mediterranean.
IT_M_029	16	In Italy, the left has focused on Europeanizing foreign decisions to the immense and obvious detriment of Italy, which, on the contrary, has an interest in weaving a network of bilateral agreements with economies bordering the Common Sea.
IT_M_029	17	In strengthening economic, energy and strategic ties with countries such as Turkey and Algeria, the League wants to include binding guarantees on the fight against terrorism and irregular immigration, which are crucial for border externalization.
IT_M_029	18	RESTORATION OF A STABLE AND BALANCED INTERNATIONAL ORDER The League is committed to restoring a liberal-style international order, free of outside interference and aimed at stability such as that which was established in Europe in the aftermath of World War II thanks to the efforts of the United States, our solid ally, and the system of alliances and international cooperation fostered by it.
IT_M_029	19	A balanced order based on the abandoned or progressively violated economic and security principles of the Bretton Woods agreements on the one hand and the UN Charter on the other.
IT_M_029	20	The result has been unregulated globalization of trade, which has caused serious alterations in the social and economic balances of almost every country, starting with Italy.
IT_M_029	21	In the financial sphere, for example, the abolition in the U.S. of the Glass-Steagall Act, which distinguished between commercial and merchant banks, meant that under the impetus of the U.S.-led International Monetary Fund, this separation was also abolished in other countries, resulting in the substantial transformation of commercial banks into merchant banks.
IT_M_029	22	So we want to recover a liberal international order, with Italy playing a leading role in bringing back its cardinal principles within its main alliances-NATO and the EU.
IT_M_029	23	For NATO, we call for greater implementation of the principle of stability, as expressed in the alliance's new strategic concept, by rethinking the use of force not authorized by the UN Security Council.
IT_M_029	24	In hypothesizing a new European order in the aftermath of the current very serious Ukrainian crisis, Italy must have stability as its goal, keeping in mind that the enlargement of an alliance on a given chessboard, entails an alteration of the balance necessary for peace in Europe.
IT_M_030	1	Enterprise, an engine of the country's development
IT_M_030	2	Italy's economic and social fortunes in the coming decades will be largely defined by the choices and behaviors we decide to adopt today.
IT_M_030	3	The Italy toward which we should strive is a more efficient and sustainability-conscious country, one where merit is encouraged and skills nurtured to restart a social mobility that has been immobile for some time now.
IT_M_030	4	Where opportunities for young people and women increase, and the spheres of market and state intervention are well defined and regulated.
IT_M_030	5	For the future of the country, enterprise must return to center stage; in fact, enterprises and workers are, with ingenuity and savings, the levers to resume a path of revitalization that has been interrupted for too long.
IT_M_030	6	The ability to use European resources efficiently is strongly influenced by the institutional and regulatory environment.
IT_M_030	7	For Italy, the new resources represent an opportunity to create an environment conducive to more robust and inclusive growth, provided we rebuild the capacity to define and implement effective and broad-based public policies.
IT_M_030	8	In this sense, two fundamental issues for political-institutional arrangements emerge strongly: trust and the effectiveness of rules.
IT_M_030	9	The trust of citizens and businesses in public authorities is an indispensable factor for our democracy, so governments need to shape their actions in such a way as to ensure predictability and certainty of rules, effective implementation of decisions made and, as a result, investment, employment and competitiveness.
IT_M_030	10	What is needed more generally is a retrenchment of the state, a downsizing of the perimeter of the public, and renewed confidence in the abilities of individuals, families and businesses relieved of the burden of an oppressive and difficult bureaucracy.
IT_M_030	11	BUSINESSES In Italy, SMEs account for 99.9 percent of the total number of businesses operating throughout the country, generating more than 70 percent of our country's turnover and helping to employ more than 81 percent of workers.
IT_M_030	12	This is why SMEs are the real backbone of the Italian production system to be encouraged, supported and stimulated.
IT_M_030	13	The pandemic and the ongoing conflict in the middle of Europe, have been and are a hard blow to our business fabric, and for this reason SMEs will have to continue to be the best investment for a real economic revival, through a series of measures to support liquidity and credit, intervening both on incentives for productive investment and on employment and labor costs.
IT_M_030	14	JUSTICE AND BUSINESS The justice system suffers from a general distrust on the part of civil society as a whole, even before investors, and this general situation has decidedly negative effects on economic life.
IT_M_030	15	For the past several years, the picture has been further complicated by the fact that especially on criminal justice reforms there has been the greatest tension and political back-and-forth.
IT_M_030	16	In any case, the NRP (as indeed in fiscal and administrative matters) requires Italy to take certain actions on justice in order to access European funds, which in any case requires rather quick and courageous decisions, even on the hottest points.
IT_M_030	17	On the civil rite, above all, streamlining and rationalization is needed.
IT_M_030	18	In parallel, alternative (consensual) dispute resolution tools should be enhanced to limit the use of trials, including with tax incentives.
IT_M_030	19	In general terms, containing litigation, in dispute resolution, is always the least costly option for society as a whole THE BUSINESS CRISIS The new Business Crisis and Insolvency Code came into effect in July 2022;
IT_M_030	20	the reform provided an alert system to detect the presence of a state of crisis at an early stage and intervene with the new institution of negotiated settlement.
IT_M_030	21	With this system, the role of planning tools such as the business plan and budget, applicable to commercial and agricultural entrepreneurs without size limitations, becomes even more central.
IT_M_030	22	Our proposals to improve the reform:
IT_M_030	23	Revise business bankruptcy and asset seizure thresholds, as well as asset valuation criteria, to ensure business continuity in times of crisis
IT_M_030	24	Increase the threshold of 20 thousand euros for overdue and unpaid VAT-related debt to initiate the negotiated settlement for debts against the Treasury, in order to avoid the risk of bankruptcy of thousands of companies due to non-payment of the tax
IT_M_030	25	Optimize the credit/debit clearing tool with public administrations, given that in 2021 PA payment defaults amounted to 55.6 billion (3.1 percent of national GDP)
NL_002	1	German intel boss:
NL_002	2	climate scene infiltrated by far left
NL_002	3	It comes as no surprise:
NL_002	4	Hamburg's domestic intelligence chief, Torsten Voss, has warned the establishment against infiltration by leftist extremists.
NL_002	5	"HAMBURG Leftist extremists exploited ""socially widely accepted or widely discussed issues to get in touch with establishment initiatives to establish their anti-constitutional views,"" he told German daily Die Welt."
NL_002	6	Violence-oriented groups such as the Interventionist Left (IL) therefore focus on issues such as environmental protection and the fight against high rents.
NL_002	7	"According to Voss, they could, for example, ""invade democratic society through popular subjects, like a creeping poison."
NL_002	8	This is a challenge to democracy that should not be underestimated, as more than 70 percent of left-wing extremists in the Hanseatic city are considered violence-oriented.
NL_002	9	The issue of rescuing migrants is being exploited by leftist extremists.
NL_002	10	"There have also been attempts to undermine the ""Friday for the Future"" movement."
NL_002	11	Back in April, Hamburg's Office for the Protection of the Constitution - German domestic intelligence service - accused the leftist extremist scene that it was not concerned about protecting the climate, but rather about spreading its own messages.
NL_002	12	At the time, constitutionalists explicitly mentioned the IL, its spokeswoman Emily Laquer and the alliance Ende Gelände In March, Laquer launched the student strike in Hamburg to which Greta Thunberg was invited.
NL_002	13	"There she demanded the expropriation of energy supplier Vattenfall The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has confirmed that groups like the CAA are trying to gain a foothold in the ""Fridays for the Future"" movement."
NL_002	14	"As early as October 2018, the Intel Authority warned, ""Since late 2014, the topic of 'climate protection' has increasingly come to the attention of left-wing extremists because of the political debate over a planned energy transition and the planned decommissioning of coal-fired power plants. "" And further, ""Young people in particular are focused on popular topics such as 'climate protection' and the protests against the 'profit maximization of large corporations,' both politicized and long-term issues of the left-wing extremist scene."""
NL_002	15	"The IL, which is one of the most influential left-wing alliances in Germany and is known for its violence and militancy, has been trying for years through ""targeted tactical-strategic alliance work with non-extremists"" to help left-wing extremist agitation beyond their own scene."
NL_002	16	"It acts as ""a link both within the left-wing extremist spectrum and between extremists and non-extremists,"" the Federal Bureau warned, speaking of a dangerous ""pivotal function."""
NL_002	17	"Laquer posted photos of himself during the school strike in Hamburg on Twitter and demanded, ""expropriate Vattenfall."""
NL_002	18	The IL official sees her movement as spearheading the current climate protests.
NL_002	19	"""Who would have thought, when we brought the first climate camp to Germany in 2008, that 11 years later a new generation of activists was forcing the coal exit,"" she cheered on social media."
NL_002	20	"The IL already wrote on their homepage in 2016, ""With the Ende Gelände, we have created an incredibly big thing."""
NL_002	21	"The primary goal for extremists is to use everyday political issues with coalitions for action ""to ensure that it can be integrated into the democratic spectrum."""
NL_002	22	The IL played a leading role in the protests and riots in the Hambach Forest.
NL_002	23	According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, it is among the most influential left-wing alliances in Germany.
NL_002	24	In 2017, it was largely responsible for the serious riots during the G20 summit in Hamburg.
NL_007	1	Sylvana Simons outraged: 'Afghan family deported to Afghanistan!'
NL_007	2	Because Afghanistan would be unsafe.
NL_007	3	Although the family in question has no reason to believe they would be the target of violence.
NL_007	4	Sylvana Simons and her fop party BIJ1 are wooing once again.
NL_007	5	The reason is that the Dutch government is deporting an Afghan family, with four children, to their own country.
NL_007	6	So they go back to Afghanistan.
NL_007	7	Not because they themselves want to, but because the government has concluded that it is now safe enough there, at least for the family in question.
NL_007	8	BIJ1 strongly disagrees.
NL_007	9	Because you know: as far as that crackpot party is concerned, refugees should never be asked to return to their own country.
NL_007	10	No, no, the more people come to the Netherlands, regardless of their background and willingness to integrate.
NL_007	11	"""An Afghan family with 4 minor children was deported to Kabul yesterday after four years in the Netherlands,"" ."
NL_007	12	"""BIJ1 is appalled that once again human lives are so endangered by the Dutch government."
NL_007	13	"Afghanistan was the most insecure country in the world in 2018, according to the Global Peace Index, and it's only getting worse."""
NL_007	14	"""Last summer, a motion submitted by Amsterdam BIJ1 was passed stating that the municipality would not cooperate with deportations to Afghanistan."
NL_007	15	The motion also asks the municipality to keep up pressure in The Hague to stop evictions.
NL_007	16	"The Dutch government, however, continues as usual."""
NL_007	17	"""Afghanistan is an unsafe country for everyone."
NL_007	18	"That is why BIJ1 advocates a generous asylum policy for people from Afghanistan,"" the party then concluded."
NL_007	19	But does BIJ1 then have so much detailed information that the family in question is not sure of their lives?
NL_007	20	No, of course not.
NL_007	21	There is unrest in Afghanistan, and as far as Sylvana and co. are concerned, that is reason enough to welcome all Afghans who want to come to the Netherlands with open arms.
NL_007	22	Knetter.

NL_008	1	MEP disgusted by surcharge affair:
NL_008	2	'Blot in history of rule of law'
NL_008	3	The European Parliament is disgusted by the Dutch allowance scandal.
NL_008	4	Europe must make every effort to prevent such forms of institutional racism from occurring anywhere in Europe ever again.
NL_008	5	In a plenary debate this evening, requested by Samira Rafaela (D66), both political The Hague and Brussels got heavy handed.
NL_008	6	Dutch and other Members of Parliament from left to right did not have a good word to say about the Dutch government, which plunged thousands of families into misfortune and has still not compensated many victims. ,,Rutte is always at the forefront of taking the measure of countries like Poland and Hungary.
NL_008	7	"Instead of looking at the mote in others' eyes, it is better to look at the beam in his own eye,"" said JA21's Michael Hoogeveen."
NL_008	8	"'Take responsibility' Equality Commissioner Helena Dalli was blamed for doing nothing to address the scandal from Brussels. ""Take responsibility, and at least ensure a moratorium on algorithms,"" Rafaela urged her."
NL_008	9	The Dutch tax authorities used them to detect abuse and through the computer programs automatically found people of foreign origin and often with low incomes. ''Algorithms without rules can have life-destroying consequences.
NL_008	10	"People should never have to face a computer empty-handed again,"" said Kim van Sparrentak (GroenLinks)."
NL_008	11	"Agnes Jongerius (PvdA): ""We are already at 25,000 victims and the counter is still running."
NL_008	12	"'This was not the intention,' you hear afterwards, but the impression remains that this was exactly the intention."""
NL_008	13	Numerous MEPs, including foreign ones, find it scandalous that after the initial cover-up, the Netherlands is now dragging its feet on compensation.
NL_008	14	And according to Anja Hazekamp (Party for the Animals), it must not stop there. ,,The government must acknowledge culpability and feel what it has done.
NL_008	15	"This is the result of a soured neoliberal government that has cut itself to pieces."""
NL_008	16	'Want to see deeds' Malta's Equality Commissioner got little credit from Parliament.
NL_008	17	"She screened ""a compendium of good practices"" and European and national action plans. ''We want to see actions."
NL_008	18	"This does concern the rule of law,"" it said."
NL_008	19	Moreover, the data abuse in the Netherlands is not isolated; border protection agency Frontex and Europol also handle personal data far too easily, according to French Green Saskia Bricmont.
NL_008	20	"Slovak Christian Democrat Peter Pollák said institutional racism without any political or judicial consequence is also the order of the day in his country. ""Roma children are automatically placed in schools for children with learning disabilities."
NL_008	21	"Their future is destroyed based on their name or skin color."""
NL_008	22	No reason for more decisiveness.
NL_008	23	Dalli saw no reason in Parliament's fierce criticism for more decisiveness.
NL_008	24	"Also in her closing remarks, she kept promises of ""monitoring,"" the belief that Parliament and the Justice Department will continue to properly handle the surcharge case in the Netherlands, and the hope that other countries will learn lessons from the mention of the surcharge scandal in her annual rule of law report."
NL_008	25	Skepticism could be seen on the faces of numerous Members of Parliament.
NL_009	1	Bank of America announces hyperinflation
NL_009	2	I've been amazed for years that most people seem to think it's normal for central banks to keep creating unimaginable amounts of money out of thin air with the push of a button, time and time again, so that governments can keep spending tons of money, thinking that at the same time their purchasing power can be maintained.
NL_009	3	Anyone who paid attention to two economics classes in high school knows that this goes against all financial and fiscal laws, and sooner or later must end in tragedy.
NL_009	4	Now it is almost here: noted Bank of America is literally announcing HYPERinflation.
NL_009	5	That means the value of the currency will collapse, and the prices of most goods and services will rise dramatically.
NL_009	6	Based on the annual figures, the number of U.S. companies reporting (high) inflation increased by nearly 800%.
NL_009	7	"Bank of America therefore cannot help but note that this ""at the very least indicates that 'temporary' hyperinflation is coming."
NL_009	8	Commodities (+28%), consumer prices (+36%), transportation (+35%) and manufactured goods are particularly at risk of exploding in price.
NL_009	9	"While the BoA thinks it will still be ""manageable,"" hyperinflation is precisely a process that inherently proves that something is whooping OUT of control. (1) Towering prices."
NL_009	10	Among other things, this means that citizens will soon have to pay much more for just about everything at an accelerating rate.
NL_009	11	Actually, we see this hidden high inflation already present in sky-high housing prices (after all, these are not associated with a strong economic recovery, but with a government-financed debt economy).
NL_009	12	Also, more and more people are complaining that their weekly groceries have become so much more expensive in a short period of time.
NL_009	13	End of prosperity now really in sight.
NL_009	14	As annoying as you will find it to read, the end of Western prosperity is actually coming.
NL_009	15	Indeed, the situation in Europe is hardly different from that in the United States, and in some ways much worse.
NL_009	16	Think of the never to be repaid sovereign debts of Italy, Greece and Spain, and in fact France and Belgium as well.
NL_009	17	In addition, major European systemic banks such as Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and UniCredit are effectively technically bankrupt.
NL_009	18	Green Deal and Great Reset.
NL_009	19	"Then there is the EU's ""Green Deal"" and the WEF's ""Great Reset"" on top of that."
NL_009	20	The first will make energy, transportation and food virtually unaffordable for millions of people, and the second will permanently end the last vestiges of freedom and self-determination we have left, and - according to WEF's own figures - put 35% to 41% of people out of work.
NL_009	21	And while the West is tearing itself down realizing this climate dystopia, China and Russia have already begun to take over from us.
NL_025	1	Noa Pothoven:
NL_025	2	reasoning away from euthanasia
NL_025	3	Some 250 Noa are said to still be walking around in the Netherlands.
NL_025	4	Voices rise for specialized facilities, with no waiting lists and where the best specialists work.
NL_025	5	I do not believe in this solution.
NL_025	6	We have the best trained therapists and psychiatrists in the Netherlands.
NL_025	7	So should we specialize even further?
NL_025	8	In my opinion, it is not about expertise or specialization, but a change in attitude.
NL_025	9	The latter I would like to explain in this contribution.
NL_025	10	What would have been the right approach for Noa?
NL_025	11	I cannot answer that question directly, especially since I only have the information that was obtained through the media.
NL_025	12	I only want to indicate here what can be recommended based on my clinical experience.
NL_025	13	I have twice been director of a closed institution for severely behaviorally disturbed girls.
NL_025	14	Then for more than thirty years I led projects where boys and girls with the same severe disorders were treated intensively but at home.
NL_025	15	More than half of the girls had experienced incest, rape or molestation.
NL_025	16	Automutilation and suicide attempts were frequent.
NL_025	17	Over the years, I gained insight into what works and what doesn't work with this very difficult group of adolescents.
NL_025	18	Scientific research always accompanied the treatments.
NL_025	19	On this basis, I would like to make the following recommendations, with due trepidation.
NL_025	20	It is not about treating an eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
NL_025	21	The issue is Noa's treatment.
NL_025	22	What is meant by this?
NL_025	23	Noa was much more than her disorders.
NL_025	24	She will certainly have had many talents and good qualities as well.
NL_025	25	In addition, she faced many problems, which she hid from those around her for years.
NL_025	26	Until she was 11, Noa was doing well.
NL_025	27	So she had a nice childhood with her parents.
NL_025	28	Her parents could be proud of that and Noa could make good memories.
NL_025	29	This should have been a major theme in conversations with the parents and with the girl.
NL_025	30	This is how we get these people out of the atmosphere of all misery and failure.
NL_025	31	Perhaps that is exactly what social workers have neglected.
NL_025	32	The counselor must build a trusting relationship with, including talking about the positive aspects of personality and life.
NL_025	33	I usually did not do that myself, but for this purpose sought out one of my young assistants with whom it clicked well between a patient and her.
NL_025	34	That employee then received the necessary guidance and advice from the team.
NL_025	35	"In fact, based on countless experiences, I would venture to say that a young trainee who is highly motivated and all about her ""client"" can achieve better results that the most experienced specialist."
NL_025	36	After all, everything is about the supportive relationship, especially with mental health complaints and disorders.
NL_025	37	"Second, the treatment of should not focus on the ""client"" alone."
NL_025	38	"Treatment aimed at the individual always carries the message that the person is ""sick"" or ""disturbed,"" which can easily be coupled with a great but unjustified sense of guilt or with tremendously low self-esteem."
NL_025	39	Noa had a father and a mother, a brother and a sister.
NL_025	40	By this I do not mean that all family members should have been treated.
NL_025	41	The parents, her brother and sister were with Noa for hours every day.
NL_025	42	The social worker at most a few hours a week.
NL_025	43	Family members could therefore play a crucial role in Noa's treatment, counseling and support.
NL_025	44	On the Internet, I saw an interview with Noa's parents.
NL_025	45	They seemed like motivated parents to me, who unfortunately suffered greatly from what happened to their daughter over all these years.
NL_025	46	These parents are also entitled to support.
NL_025	47	Regular and frequent home visits can work wonders here.
NL_025	48	In fact, researchers have shown that home visits are a crucial factor in the effects of treatment.
NL_025	49	In my own research, the establishment of a collaborative relationship between the counselor and parents was shown to have a beneficial effect on adolescent behavior for up to five years after treatment ended.
NL_025	50	The solution does not lie in establishing yet another, expensive over-specialized institution.
NL_025	51	Rather, I advocate a change in mentality among counselors: don't assume disorders, approach the client as a person who has his or her own talents and abilities, seek out the people at home, prove how committed you are, involve parents and other family members in treatment, tell them that they can play a much more important role than the best therapist, never lose heart, and if necessary sacrifice your free time to alleviate the worst need.
NL_025	52	With the latter, waiting lists never develop.
NL_025	53	People who are suffering greatly psychologically especially need someone who can listen, really cares about them and gives them a warm heart.
NL_028	1	Read this too!
NL_028	2	Background: the battle for automotive data
NL_028	3	Have you ever considered that most modern cars capture all kinds of data?
NL_028	4	Cars that are connected can even send that data.
NL_028	5	In fact, however, that data belongs to you.
NL_028	6	The government believes consumers should be in charge of their own data.
NL_028	7	"It literally says, ""To ensure everyone's privacy, we set ground rules about the ownership and use of travel data."""
NL_028	8	Travel dates thus.
NL_028	9	That's all the data generated when you move from A to B.
NL_028	10	"That can be by car or by public transportation, but we focus on the ""travel data"" produced when you drive a car."
NL_028	11	With all the electronic safety systems and information technology used, you could say a car is something like a brain.
NL_028	12	That brain tracks exactly what the car is doing and also records where the car is and at what time.
NL_028	13	All that information can be traced back to your car's license plate and VIN number, and therefore it is personal information.
NL_028	14	Moreover, your car also records information that is about you personally, such as your driving style.
NL_028	15	The various systems in your car are all linked together, so the brain in your car not only perceives that you are driving 100 km/h, it also sees (thanks to traffic sign recognition) that you are doing so on an 80 km/h road in the dark (lights are on), while it is raining (windshield wipers are on).
NL_028	16	Moreover, in many cases, your car connects with your smartphone or tablet and can communicate with its surroundings, such as other cars or roadside systems.
NL_028	17	If you were to combine all that data endlessly, it would create a mountain of data about you and your car.
NL_028	18	Cars that are connected thus send their data periodically.
NL_028	19	"""That usually ends up in a server at the car manufacturer's premises and they decide what happens to that data, who is allowed to use it and under what conditions,"" explained Leo Bingen, Smart Mobility & ITS consultant at the RAI Association."
NL_028	20	However, the non-branded market, such as insurers, leasing companies and consumer groups, want much freer and more direct access to this vehicle data to offer digital services without manufacturer intervention.
NL_028	21	"This discussion is still ongoing."""
NL_028	22	"""Deciding who has access to the data from your car should become a separate moment in the car buying process."
NL_028	23	It should be a stand-alone contract.
NL_028	24	Not only with new cars, but also when buying a used car, you as a consumer should again be able to decide where the data from your car goes.
NL_028	25	Even during the period of use, customers should be able to change the consents, both opt-in and opt-out, by the way.
NL_028	26	"The point is that the control of this information lies with the motorist and no one else."""
NL_030	1	30 U.S. Democrats demand Biden negotiate with Russia
NL_030	2	In view of the catastrophic possibilities of nuclear escalation and misjudgments, which become all the greater the longer the war lasts, we agree with your goal of avoiding direct military conflict as the highest priority for national security.
NL_030	3	Given the devastation that this war brings to Ukraine and the world, as well as in view of the risk of a danger of catastrophic escalation, we also believe that it is in the interest of Ukraine, the United States and the world to avoid a prolonged conflict.... The Russian invasion caused immeasurable damage to the Ukrainian people and led to the death of tens of thousands of civilians and Ukrainian soldiers as well as to the expulsion of 13 million people, while the capture of cities in eastern Ukraine by Russia led to the decisive moment of the conflict and to the establishment of Russian control over about 20% of Ukrainian territory.
NL_030	4	The conflict threatens another 10 million people around the world as skyrocketing prices for wheat, fertilizer and fuel create acute crises related to hunger and poverty around the world.
NL_030	5	A war, lasting for years and possibly escalating in its intensity and geographical expansion, threatens to displace many more people in Ukraine, kill them and cause hunger, poverty and death throughout the world.
NL_030	6	"The conflict has also contributed to a rise in gas and food prices at home and fueled inflation and high oil prices for Americans in recent months...The alternative to diplomacy is a protracted war, one that is fraught with certainties as well as catastrophic and incalculable risks...We agree with the administration's view that it is not America's job to pressure the Ukrainian government regarding sovereign decisions and that there should be ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine."""
NL_030	7	However, because we as legislators are responsible for spending tens of billions of American taxpayer dollars for military support in this conflict, we believe that such participation in this war also carries with it a responsibility for the U.S. to seriously explore all possible ways, including direct contact with Russia, to limit the damage and support Ukraine in reaching a peaceful solution.... In conclusion, we call on you to engage in energetic diplomatic efforts in support of a negotiated solution and a ceasefire, to engage in direct talks with Russia, to sound out the prospects for a new, mutually acceptable European security agreement that would allow for a sovereign and independent Ukraine, and to work, in concert with our Ukrainian partners, to work for a swift end to the conflict and to affirm this goal as America's highest priority.
NL_037	1	CDA wants to strengthen ties with Al Assad, but House rejects proposal
NL_037	2	CDA MP Martijn van Helvert wants the Netherlands to strengthen diplomatic ties with Syrian President Bashar Al Assad.
NL_037	3	According to Van Helvert, this is necessary to find a solution for the trial of Dutch IS fighters and the return of Syrians who fled Al Assad's regime.
NL_037	4	The Christian party made the proposal Wednesday in a debate in the House of Representatives, but found little support from both the opposition and coalition parties.
NL_037	5	"""Talking to Al Assad could be seen as losing political face,"" Van Helvert said."
NL_037	6	At the same time, he sees that the Americans, European partners, but also Islamic State have failed to topple Al Assad and that the Syrian dictator is firmly back in the saddle.
NL_037	7	The CDA member estimates that a future of Syria with Al Assad will provide the stability needed to return Syrian refugees to the Netherlands, among other things.
NL_037	8	And with Iraq not seeing the trial of Dutch IS fighters currently detained in Syria, the option of them being tried in Syria must be held up.
NL_037	9	CDA receives criticism from opposition and coalition.
NL_037	10	"The VVD does not understand why the Netherlands has to make ""a knee-jerk reaction"" toward Al Assad, and on its own to strengthen ties."
NL_037	11	In the past, the party has advocated engaging precisely with dictators, but restoring diplomatic ties with Al Assad is going too far for VVD MP Sven Koopmans.
NL_037	12	"""How can Al Assad, who has hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths on his conscience, contribute to stability?"
NL_037	13	"What stability?"""
NL_037	14	, Koopmans believes.
NL_037	15	D66's Sjoerd Sjoerdsma also sees nothing in the proposal.
NL_037	16	"""Al Assad is Islamic State in a neat suit."
NL_037	17	"He is a foster father of IS."""
NL_037	18	Sjoerdsma points out that Al Assad contributed to the rise of IS by releasing radical jihadists from Syrian prisons.
NL_037	19	Leaving justice for the Dutch IS'ers to Al Assad is a bad plan, according to the D66'er, since the Syrian president has released IS'ers in the past.
NL_037	20	"Green Left warns that Al Assad's strengthening of diplomatic ties will be seen as a reward for ""his disgusting behavior."""
NL_037	21	The Labour Party points out that Syrian refugees were actually fleeing Al Assad's reign of terror.
NL_037	22	Block does not want to tighten ties.
NL_037	23	Therefore, it does not look like the Cabinet will heed the CDA's call.
NL_037	24	Minister Stef Blok (Foreign Affairs) said this weekend in an interview with NU.nl that there is no future for Al Assad in Syria.
NL_037	25	Blok said he cannot rule out the possibility that the Dutch IS currently detained in Syria could fall into the hands of Al Assad, but that does not mean the Netherlands will restore diplomatic ties.
NL_037	26	"""I will not let Al Assad blackmail me into strengthening diplomatic ties."
NL_037	27	For Al Assad, there is no future in Syria.
NL_037	28	The crimes against humanity he has committed are SO terrible.
NL_037	29	"He cannot stay,"" Blok said."
NL_037	30	CDA points to diplomatic ties with China.
NL_037	31	Van Helvert agrees with the Chamber that Al Assad is responsible for atrocities against his own people, but reiterates that Western allies have failed to depose him.
NL_037	32	Now that Al Assad is more firmly in the saddle with Russia's help, following the departure of the Americans and Turkey's invasion, Van Helvert believes the Netherlands should at least strengthen ties at the lowest diplomatic level.
NL_037	33	He also points out to his fellow MPs that the Netherlands maintains good ties with China at the very highest level, while the country commits human rights violations on a large scale, such as the oppression of the Uighurs.
NL_042	1	No family caregiver remains
NL_042	2	The recruitment of potential family caregivers is declining.
NL_042	3	A seventy-something who needs help with grocery shopping or chores around the house can currently call on an average of four family members or friends.
NL_042	4	In twenty years that will be only two , according to research by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.
NL_042	5	In areas where young people are moving away, such as East Groningen, Zeelandic Flanders and South Limburg, even fewer caregivers remain.
NL_042	6	"There, the elderly have only one person ""at their disposal."
NL_042	7	"It's a side effect of the aging population, according to the PBL's ""Concern for Jobs"" study."
NL_042	8	By 2040, the Netherlands will have as many as 2.6 million people over 75, twice as many as today.
NL_042	9	Because of this growth, seventies, eighties and nineties will soon have fewer fit people around them to help them.
NL_042	10	More people at the same time.
NL_042	11	MantelzorgNL, the advocacy organization for family caregivers, is already noticing that the pressure is increasing.
NL_042	12	"""Informal caregivers report caring for more people at the same time more often than before."
NL_042	13	"Sometimes for two or three,"" said director Liesbeth Hoogendijk."
NL_042	14	"""If it has to be this way, I don't have to do it anymore,"" they increasingly say."
NL_042	15	"And they regularly wonder if they can say 'no' to some tasks."""
NL_042	16	The risk of the dwindling group of informal caregivers is that the people who help are increasingly burdened, Hoogendijk says.
NL_042	17	Sometimes they even run into burnout.
NL_042	18	"""In exceptional cases, it derails."
NL_042	19	"The caregiver then neglects the one he cares for or uses physical violence."""
NL_042	20	PBL researcher Femke Daalhuizen fears isolation of the elderly if not enough is invested in care.
NL_042	21	"""There will be more fall incidents."
NL_042	22	I then expect that the elderly will more often request emergency care or need to be admitted to a care facility.
NL_042	23	"The healthcare costs previously cut are thus shifted elsewhere in the healthcare sector."""
NL_042	24	Professional settings.
NL_042	25	But the elderly who turn to professional care facilities are also at risk of being squeezed out, PBL points out.
NL_042	26	Because to assist all those needing help over 75 in 20 years, twice as many district nurses and home care workers will be needed, 700,000 to be exact.
NL_042	27	But the Ministry of Health already foresees a shortage of more than 100,000 healthcare professionals in the coming years.
NL_042	28	"""Already we need to think about how to deliver care without needing staff,"" says PBL researcher Femke Daalhuizen."
NL_042	29	Distressing, thinks Tineke Abma, professor of diversity and participation at the VU Medical Center.
NL_042	30	Back in 2012, the Council for Health and Society warned of a staff shortage in elder care due to the aging population.
NL_042	31	'Drastic choices are inevitable,' the council admonished.
NL_042	32	"Abma: ""Yet two years later, a cut in healthcare came on top of that."""
NL_042	33	A wrong choice, she thinks.
NL_042	34	"""Nursing homes closed their doors, staff were laid off, and the industry as a whole became unattractive to work in."""
NL_042	35	As a result, in the remaining nursing homes, care is now nearly substandard, Abma says.
NL_042	36	"""I hear from the care facilities that I am a supervisor of that they cannot guarantee the quality and safety of the elderly because of the shortage of staff."""
NL_042	37	Abma even sees a dichotomy emerging among the elderly.
NL_042	38	"""Those with ample scholarship choose a commercial care facility or a home health nurse."
NL_042	39	Those who cannot afford it continue to live at home for too long, at the risk of accidents.
NL_042	40	Or relies on a public institution that has a long waiting list and cannot guarantee sufficient quality of care.
NL_042	41	Older people, they are not just middle-class pensionados enjoying life to the fullest.
NL_042	42	They are also busy volunteers, babysitting moms and dads, and caregivers who struggle with stress, or even burnout.
NL_042	43	One in five family caregivers find themselves tight on money.
NL_042	44	Informal caregivers often fail financially, research shows.
NL_042	45	Family and government must step in,

NL_044	3	"The president of the United States ""can no longer afford inaction."""
NL_044	4	Warnings of Dec. 17, 2012, addressed at this site to then-President Barack Obama.
NL_044	5	The weekend before, Adam Lanza had shot and killed 20 children and six adults at his former elementary school Sandy Hook, Connecticut.
NL_044	6	America was in a state of shock.
NL_044	7	This was never to happen again.
NL_044	8	Barack Obama cried along with the nation and promised action.
NL_044	9	"But ""Sandy Hook"" did not become a turning point; it became the beginning of an epidemic increase in mass shootings."
NL_044	10	In schools, at festivals, in malls.
NL_044	11	This past weekend, shootings in the US left 22 dead in El Paso, Texas, and 10 dead in Dayton, Ohio.
NL_044	12	Nowhere is the gap between the will of citizens and the actions of politicians as wide as on this issue.
NL_044	13	Americans call for measures to curb firearm violence.
NL_044	14	For example, following the 2018 Parkland school massacre, 92 percent of Americans wanted stricter controls on firearm buyers.
NL_044	15	It didn't.
NL_044	16	The American political system rewards opportunism and makes real change impossible.
NL_044	17	Leadership is urgently needed here.
NL_044	18	The influence of outside funders, such as the National Rifle Association, on Congressmen and other representatives of the people is too great.
NL_044	19	The debate over political campaign financing needs to be revisited.
NL_044	20	But Donald Trump's America has a second problem.
NL_044	21	Barack Obama fell short with his measures, but at least he tried to comfort and unite his people, as his predecessors did.
NL_044	22	President Donald Trump only increases the contradictions.
NL_044	23	He thus gives political backing to extremists, in a climate where it is easy to put one's money where one's mouth is.
NL_044	24	"The gunman in El Paso had chosen this city on the border with Mexico to counter an ""invasion"" of ""millions"" of migrants, a manifesto attributed to him showed."
NL_044	25	"He spoke of the ""cultural and ethnic replacement"" by migrants, accusing the American media of spreading ""fake news."""
NL_044	26	They are echoes of the message Trump persistently preaches.
NL_044	27	"Trump called Mexican migrants ""rapists"" in 2016 and has only further sharpened his tone."
NL_044	28	Four Democratic Congressmen of color, three of whom were born in the US, were advised to go back to their home countries if they do not like it in the US.
NL_044	29	Time and again, Trump plays on dark sentiments among his supporters about race and ethnicity - perhaps because he deeply believes it, perhaps for political gain.
NL_044	30	Either way, Trump has further normalized racism in his country.
NL_044	31	Words have consequences.
NL_044	32	In a country bulging with firearms, it is dangerous to use such dog whistles.
NL_044	33	Trump wrote in an enigmatic message on Twitter that he too is in favor of better background checks on firearm buyers, provided Congress approves stricter immigration laws.
NL_044	34	"With this, Trump is letting himself in on it: he is not actually interested in a solution, but is turning it into a political game. "" I alone can fix it "", Trump said in 2016."
NL_044	35	Now he has the social mission of fulfilling that promise.
NL_044	36	It is time to come up with measures that the people have long supported.
NL_044	37	And he will have to face the consequences of his rhetoric.
NL_048	1	De Croo:
NL_048	2	'We repatriate six orphans of IS fighters'
NL_048	3	"""This is about six children who no longer have parents,"" Development Minister Alexander De Croo clarified Thursday on Radio 1."
NL_048	4	'The choices their parents made are forgivable and we cannot condone them, but those are their parents' choices.
NL_048	5	Some of those children have also been abducted and are there (in the camps, ed.) in sometimes terrible conditions.
NL_048	6	According to De Croo, all the children were born in Belgium; two of the six are under the age of 10.
NL_048	7	'For all the children, extensive analysis was done by military intelligence and eventually by OCAD, the Coordination Body for Threat Assessment.
NL_048	8	The OCAD says it is acceptable for each of those six children to be taken back.
NL_048	9	As a federal government and as a minister, you have to have confidence in those services.
NL_048	10	We cannot let them cremate.
NL_048	11	Each child will receive customized counseling in our country after repatriation.
NL_048	12	For now, it is assumed that these six children will remain.
NL_048	13	"""This is not an easy operation, which is why we also tried to group this together,"" De Croo said."
NL_048	14	"According to him, there is ""absolutely no question"" that parents of Belgian children staying in the camps in Kurdish territory will be taken back in the future."
NL_048	15	The intention is for repatriation to follow as soon as possible.
NL_048	16	However, an agreement with Iraqi authorities is still needed.
NL_048	17	These live at odds with the Kurds, so another round of negotiations may be necessary.
NL_048	18	The mission does have some operational issues.
NL_048	19	The children must first be transferred from the camps to the city of Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan.
NL_048	20	From there, the Belgian military will repatriate them by military flight to Brussels.
NL_048	21	Belgium is following the example of other countries.
NL_048	22	Early this week, two more children from Syria were handed over to Dutch diplomats on the spot.
NL_048	23	The children aged 2 and 4 had a Dutch mother and a Belgian father from Maaseik in Limburg.
NL_048	24	Their father died some time ago on the battlefield, while their mother died recently due to the dire conditions in the camp.
NL_048	25	The children are the last legacy of Islamic State, which has been defeated in Iraq and Syria.
NL_048	26	The remnant fighters and sympathizers went underground; thousands died on the battlefield or in bombing raids.
NL_048	27	France only evacuated 12 children from northern Syria.
NL_048	28	Sweden, Norway and Germany have also repatriated a number of children in recent weeks.
NL_048	29	That all the countries are firing into action together is no accident.
NL_048	30	The Kurds have long been demanding that foreign governments remove their nationals from the refugee camps.
NL_048	31	"The Kurds want to completely dismantle the camps as they are emptying and conditions there are worsening,"" Belgian government sources said."
NL_048	32	Therefore, children whose identity has been established are now being offered by the Kurds with an urgent request to take them back.
NL_048	33	Belgium long maintained its stance of not actively repatriating.
NL_048	34	It received buckets of criticism for that.
NL_048	35	A team of experts from the Free University of Brussels (VUB) led by psychologist Gerrit Loots is currently on site to assist the children.
NL_048	36	Loots and Co. urged the government to deliver travel documents so they could repatriate some children.
NL_048	37	But the government didn't want to know about that.
NL_048	38	Families of children in former IS territory also litigated against the Belgian state.
NL_048	39	Belgium initially obtained court orders to repatriate the children, under penalty of fines.
NL_048	40	But the government won on appeal, removing the legal pressure.
NL_050	1	Column Michel Krielaars Infected youths beating up migrants
NL_050	2	'I almost exploded with anger when my country took in only 12 refugees,' says Czech Marek Sindelka (b. 1984) on May 16 in Amsterdam, where he is participating in the European Night of Literature.
NL_050	3	"""When even our foreign minister added that we couldn't do more, I was so embarrassed that I had to respond."
NL_050	4	"And I could only do that through literature."""
NL_050	5	It yielded the 2018 novel Material Fatigue, in which Sindelka denounces the Czech government's refugee policy without becoming moralistic.
NL_050	6	For example, he describes the human body as a material and conduit of experiences through two brothers who fled to Europe and lost each other along the way.
NL_050	7	One of them is smuggled into the Czech Republic under the hood of a car.
NL_050	8	"Sindelka: ""In Material Fatigue, the body is primarily a burden, something that works against you because of its external characteristics, so you have to prove at every checkpoint that you are not a threat."
NL_050	9	While everyone forgets that we are all equal precisely by virtue of our bodies.
NL_050	10	"Your body is the only thing you really own."""
NL_050	11	In the Czech Republic, anti-migration politics prevail during the upcoming European elections.
NL_050	12	It gives some Czechs a license to set up paramilitary vigilantes and rip off migrants.
NL_050	13	"""It is a striking number of young people who are guilty of this,"" said Sindelka."
NL_050	14	"""From bearers of humanistic values, they have degenerated into people infected with bullshit."""
NL_050	15	The Czech Republic is struggling with an explosion of far-right parties.
NL_050	16	One is led by Tomio Okamura, a Czech with a Korean-Japanese father, who is opposed to Gypsies in addition to migrants.

NL_065	5	A few months later, those same undocumented people are again in illegal residence.
NL_065	6	"Moreover, the hunger strikers themselves have indicated that they do not want a temporary, but a permanent and collective residence permit for all sans papiers,"" he responded Monday night."
NL_065	7	Coalition partner PS called on the federal government earlier in the day to grant short-stay visas to the hunger strikers in order to create bargaining space with the undocumented people who went on hunger strike.
NL_065	8	Secretary of State Sammy Mahdi says he has been doing his utmost for weeks to convince people that a hunger strike makes no sense.
NL_065	9	The accusation of inaction is regrettable given the efforts that have been made for weeks, he believes.
NL_065	10	Over the past few days, Mahdi has been working with various partners to install a neutral zone, where hunger strikers can get clarity on existing procedures.
NL_065	11	This very week that neutral zone must and will be in place, the Mahdi administration said.
NL_065	12	Conversations.
NL_065	13	Sammy Mahdi has had several conversations with about a dozen organizations in recent weeks, as well as with the sans papiers themselves.
NL_065	14	"""My job is to engage with them and also clarify honestly what the policy stands for."
NL_065	15	Asylum seekers fleeing war are entitled to protection, students who follow the rules can study here, and people who want to come here to work can apply from abroad.

NL_065	17	"We are very worried about the condition of the hunger strikers, but that should not force the policy in a certain direction,"" the secretary of state concluded."
NL_065	18	Despite many conversations, there often appears to be a great deal of ignorance about regularization.

NL_070	1	Italy Italian election winner seeks to reassure EU and financial markets 21:41
NL_070	2	The radical-right populist Brothers of Italy won as much as 26 percent in Sunday's Italian parliamentary election.
NL_070	3	But there will be no big victory party or triumphant press conference.
NL_070	4	President Giorgia Meloni urged her fellow party members to be serious and sober.
NL_070	5	The situation in the country is serious, and a herculean task awaits the new, yet-to-be-formed government.
NL_070	6	A solution to the skyrocketing energy prices that are hitting Italian families and businesses hard is imminent.
NL_070	7	In doing so, the new administration must also draft the budget quickly.
NL_070	8	That new government is still some time away, by the way, as formation negotiations will not begin until after the new Italian parliament has had its inaugural session on Oct. 13.
NL_070	9	But with such a clear election result - the right-wing electoral alliance won a clear majority in parliament - it does seem obvious that President Sergio Mattarella will soon leave the initiative for government formation to Meloni.
NL_070	10	Second tranche of 21 billion euros.
NL_070	11	Europe and international markets are especially looking forward to whoever is appointed on Economy and Finance.
NL_070	12	Italy is the third largest economy in the euro zone, but it is also a debt-laden country, as well as the main beneficiary of the Next Generation EU European coronary fund, with more than 200 billion euros in the coming years.
NL_070	13	On Tuesday, the European Commission said that Italy will be given the green light for a second tranche of 21 billion euros after the requested targets are met.
NL_070	14	There are signs that the new administration is seeking continuity.
NL_070	15	The Italian economy desperately needs the European billions in the coming years.
NL_070	16	Meloni seems well aware of that.
NL_070	17	According to Italian media, she is considering a former top executive of the Italian National Bank for the important post of Finance.
NL_070	18	That is already a contrast to four years ago.
NL_070	19	"After the last election, the radical-right Lega party in particular insisted that Paolo Savona, a euro-critical economist who described the euro as ""a German cage,"" become finance minister."
NL_070	20	Head of State Sergio Mattarella then held up Savona's appointment.
NL_070	21	There are signs that the new Italian government team is seeking continuity.
NL_070	22	Meloni's transition team is briefed on the country's financial and economic situation by Draghi's staff, and would also ask for some ideas for the budget.
NL_070	23	By Oct. 15, the European Commission expects a draft budget from Rome, which may yet be presented by the Draghi government.
NL_070	24	Then the new Italian government will have a chance to update that budget.
NL_070	25	It should all exude seriousness and responsibility, and certainly reassure international financial markets in addition to Europe.
NL_070	26	For now, that strategy is working.
NL_070	27	The international ratings agency S&P does not immediately foresee a risk in the transition to a new Italian government, it sounded just after the ballot.
NL_070	28	Confrontation Europe shuns.
NL_070	29	Meloni also seems to want to avoid confrontation with Europe for the time being in other key ministerial posts.
NL_070	30	Matteo Salvini of the Lega party may put away his dream of becoming Interior Minister again.
NL_070	31	Salvini closed Italy's borders to NGO boats, and his immigration policy put him on a collision course with the European Union.
NL_070	32	On Sunday, Salvini's Lega failed to reach 9 percent.
NL_070	33	Electorally, he weighs too lightly for such an important ministerial post.
NL_070	34	Finally, Silvio Berlusconi, the second coalition partner Meloni needs for her majority, also does not seem to have to count on a very visible role internationally.
NL_070	35	For that, especially outside Italy, he is too controversial.
NL_070	36	Meloni would, however, consider Berlusconi's party colleague Antonio Tajani, possibly as president of either chamber of parliament.
NL_070	37	Tajani likes to see himself at Foreign Affairs.
NL_070	38	The former president of the European Parliament is moderate and pro-European.
NL_070	39	This would immediately reassure Europe that Italy is not breaking European solidarity on sanctions against Moscow.

NL_072	5	We can be reached through our , at +31613650952 or at m.vink@telegraaf.nl The fire in Turkey is believed to have started Wednesday at an electricity substation.
NL_072	6	The flames cover an area of 728 acres and have so far reached seventeen homes.
NL_072	7	Nineteen people were injured by the fire, and of those, nine are still in the hospital.
NL_072	8	Firefighters are busy extinguishing, and have deployed 10 aircraft and 20 helicopters.
NL_072	9	According to Forestry Minister Vahit Kirisci, the wind is unpredictable, making extinguishing difficult.
NL_072	10	Still, firefighters managed to extinguish the fire.
NL_072	11	In Portugal and western Spain, thousands of firefighters were deployed to put out the at least 20 active fires.
NL_072	12	Temperatures rise - in some parts of Europe - to at least 45 degrees.
NL_072	13	France.
NL_072	14	In France, about a thousand firefighters and six firefighting planes tried to put out two fires southwest and southeast of Bordeaux, but still failed.
NL_072	15	They received support from firefighters from other parts of the country.
NL_072	16	The high temperatures complicate firefighting efforts, causing extensive damage to the forest.
NL_072	17	According to local media, some 3,850 hectares of forest have already been lost.
NL_072	18	The largest fire is raging about 30 kilometers south of Bordeaux near Landiras.
NL_072	19	The cause of this is not known.
NL_072	20	More than five hundred residents of some hamlets and a village near Landiras were evacuated.
NL_072	21	About 6,000 campers were evacuated overnight Wednesday because of the fire south of Arcachon, about 50 kilometers from Bordeaux.
NL_072	22	It is not known if Dutch vacationers are among the evacuees.
NL_072	23	In the town of Cazaux, hundreds of people also had to leave quickly.
NL_072	24	In recent days and weeks, countries around the Mediterranean have been plagued by persistent heat and many forest fires.
NL_072	25	Turkey's Aegean coast has also been hit several times this year.
NL_072	26	In the same area last year, the largest forest fire raged since Turkey keeps records of it.
NL_072	27	President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was then widely criticized for Turkey's alleged inadequate preparedness for large forest fires.
NL_074	1	Is failing climate policy a human rights violation?
NL_074	2	06:41 in Domestic , Foreign The European Court of Human Rights is considering several important climate cases.
NL_074	3	Are governments doing enough to combat climate change?
NL_074	4	Will a key element of the landmark Urgenda case apply to the entire European Union and even more countries?
NL_074	5	That question is on the table as the European Court of Human Rights considers today whether a country violates human rights if it does too little to combat climate change.
NL_074	6	"If the answer is ""yes,"" legal experts say it will affect all of the nearly 50 countries affiliated with the human rights treaty."
NL_074	7	"In the case brought by action group Urgenda against the Dutch state, the Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the government is obliged to do more to combat ""dangerous climate change."""
NL_074	8	"The Supreme Court stated that the European human rights treaty requires member states to protect their residents from ""real and immediate risks."""
NL_074	9	And, the Supreme Court concluded, there is global agreement on the extent to which climate change poses a threat.
NL_074	10	Three important climate cases are in play at the European Court, two of them today.
NL_074	11	One involves a group of Swiss elderly women, who argue that seniors' lives are at risk from increasing heat.
NL_074	12	The other was brought by a French former mayor, who believes the French government is not doing enough to combat warming and thus sea level rise, which could affect his municipality (near Dunkirk).
NL_074	13	A third case involves a group of Portuguese youths aged 12 to 21.
NL_074	14	They have sued dozens of countries, including the Netherlands, holding it responsible, in particular, for increasingly bad forest fires in their country.
NL_074	15	This case will be heard later this year.
NL_074	16	The youth believe that countries are negligent because their future is threatened by the disastrous effects of climate change.
NL_074	17	Dutch lawyers are following what is now happening at the European Court with great interest.
NL_074	18	Human rights also played an important role in the climate case against Shell, won by Milieudefensie two years ago.
NL_074	19	Lawyer in both the Urgenda and Shell climate cases is Dutch lawyer Roger Cox.
NL_074	20	"He believes that if the European Court rules that countries must indeed do more for the climate, it will have a ""huge scope"" in Europe."
NL_074	21	That case confirms that failure to meet climate goals means human rights violations, including in the Netherlands.
NL_074	22	In addition, with such a ruling in hand, the Dutch government could urge other countries to do more.
NL_074	23	"""This is important,"" Cox said, ""because it will lead to faster international climate action."""
NL_074	24	The European Court of Human Rights gives great weight to these climate cases, says Urgenda lawyer Dennis van Berkel.
NL_074	25	He advised the Swiss women, and is at the Strasbourg court today.
NL_074	26	"He said the importance is evidenced by the fact that the cases are heard by the ""Grand Chamber."""
NL_075	1	Reportage Party Congress CDA Nitrogen?
NL_075	2	The CDA prefers to talk about community spirit.
NL_075	3	The CDA would like to talk about standards, values and community spirit again.
NL_075	4	At the kickoff of the campaign for the Provincial Council elections, Wopke Hoekstra called for the reintroduction of active military service.
NL_075	5	Jan Peter Balkenende wanted to use the conscription law to send problem youths to education camps.
NL_075	6	Sybrand Buma wanted to reintroduce active military service; he saw it as a way to create more unity in society.
NL_075	7	In both cases, it remained an idea.
NL_075	8	Now the CDA is trying again.
NL_075	9	In Amersfoort, where CDA members gathered this Saturday for an election congress kicking off the campaign for the Provincial Council and Water Board elections, CDA leader Wopke Hoekstra made a plea for the reintroduction of active military service.
NL_075	10	That was suspended more than a quarter century ago in the Netherlands.
NL_075	11	The CDA wants to reverse that.
NL_075	12	"Young people between the ages of 18 and 25, Hoekstra said, ""can devote a year to strengthening our armed forces and national security, or to a social service task, such as care and welfare."""
NL_075	13	"That would make the Netherlands ""safer and more together."""
NL_075	14	That there is no majority for the plan in the House of Representatives, the Christian Democrats also know.
NL_075	15	But the idea fits a story that the CDA has been eager to tell again for some time, and thus in the campaign.
NL_075	16	This is about a sense of community, about norms and values.
NL_075	17	"In Amersfoort, the words ""together"" and ""connection"" fell above average."
NL_075	18	"And if at all possible, CDA'ers on stage and around it liked to say that it is time for ""less me and more us."""
NL_075	19	Community Fund.
NL_075	20	Earlier in the week, the Lower House faction came up with plans to invest more in the region to counter inequality between the Randstad and the rest of the Netherlands.
NL_075	21	Among other things, the group came up with the idea of creating a community fund to finance facilities such as community centers or swimming pools.
NL_075	22	It is no coincidence that the CDA wants to appropriate that issue.
NL_075	23	First, Christian Democrats are feeling the pressure from Caroline van der Plas's BoerBurgerBeweging, which is very much focused on non-urban areas.
NL_075	24	The two parties are making opposite moves in the polls: BBB is on a gain, the CDA on a loss.
NL_075	25	But the fact that the CDA again emphatically starts talking about community spirit and the region also has to do with something more fundamental than electoral competition.
NL_075	26	Following the electoral defeat in the 2021 House of Representatives elections, the party asked former president of the Scientific Institute Richard van Zwol to consider the party's recognizability.
NL_075	27	And behind the scenes, CDA workers knew: this is also about the party's survival.
NL_075	28	Van Zwol wrote an agenda for the CDA, with issues on which the party should focus in the coming years.
NL_075	29	One: connecting differences.
NL_075	30	It is not really new for the CDA; after the turn of the century, Jan-Peter Balkenende's narrative of norms and values made the CDA the largest party.
NL_075	31	But in the years that followed, it disappeared more and more into the background.
NL_075	32	The Christian Democrats instead tried to raise their profile on issues such as the economy, security and migration.
NL_075	33	Known views.
NL_075	34	On the latter topic, Wopke Hoekstra also spoke Saturday.
NL_075	35	"""The current numbers are simply not sustainable,"" he said."
NL_075	36	Not coming up with new ideas, Hoekstra repeated familiar CDA positions, which are about reception in the region, a European external border and the European agreement that a refugee must go through the asylum procedure in the country of arrival.
NL_075	37	What was striking is that Hoekstra almost didn't mention the issue that resonates so strongly with CDA supporters: the nitrogen issue.
NL_075	38	In summer
NL_075	39	, after that he wouldn't say anything about it.
NL_075	40	An investigation by EenVandaag recently showed that the majority of provincial list leaders for the CDA do not like the 2030 nitrogen deadline.
NL_075	41	Moreover, they feel that the money set aside by the government for nitrogen plans, 24 billion euros, is far too little.
NL_075	42	"In Amersfoort, the word ""nitrogen"" fell only once."
NL_075	43	"Hoekstra, he told the room full of CDA members, had read back ""literally CDA motions"" in Johan Remkes' nitrogen advice."
NL_075	44	"""That's the CDA at work!"""
NL_075	45	Behind him were the provincial framers on a podium.
NL_075	46	They looked out on his back.

NL_077	1	Ukraine In Kiev, the EU shows its solidarity with Ukraine With a sizeable delegation, Von der Leyen wanted to convey that Ukraine is not alone.
NL_077	2	Yet expectations of a quick entry into the union were also tempered.
NL_077	3	The journey was the message.
NL_077	4	It was her fourth visit, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday, standing next to President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kiev.
NL_077	5	And this time she had not come alone.
NL_077	6	As many as 15 Eurocommissioners had traveled along for a meeting with the Ukrainian government.
NL_077	7	Another Zelensky summit with Von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel will follow this Friday.
NL_077	8	With the two-day meeting just before the anniversary of Putin's invasion on Feb. 24, the EU wanted to underscore that Ukraine is not alone in the fight and will not go it alone.
NL_077	9	That message was addressed to both Ukraine and Russia.
NL_077	10	President Putin, meanwhile, took advantage Thursday of the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory at Stalingrad to issue threats toward the West.
NL_077	11	"""We are threatened by German tanks again,"" he said, referring to the West's recent decision to give German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine."
NL_077	12	"""Those who think they will win on the battlefield evidently do not understand that a modern war with Russia will be fundamentally different for them."
NL_077	13	We do not send our tanks to their border.
NL_077	14	But we have a way to respond and that will not stop with the deployment of armored vehicles.
NL_077	15	"Everyone should understand that,"" Putin said in what looked like a new disguised threat of nuclear weapons."
NL_077	16	The EU stands by beleaguered Ukraine with financial and economic support, funding arms supplies and hosting refugees.
NL_077	17	In total, the EU and member states have put 50 billion euros on the table, 37.8 billion in financial and humanitarian aid and 12 billion in military aid.
NL_077	18	In its luggage, the Commission had a few more news items on Thursday.
NL_077	19	It puts 25 million euros on the table for demining areas recaptured from Russia.
NL_077	20	It also doubles the number of Ukrainian military trained in the EU from 15,000 to 30,000 soldiers.
NL_077	21	Von der Leyen also announced that there will be an international center in The Hague to do preparatory work to try the Russian leadership for its part in the invasion of Ukraine.
NL_077	22	The center will coordinate the collection of evidence as well as prepare indictments.
NL_077	23	"""We will be able to start very soon,"" Von der Leyen said."
NL_077	24	"""Russia must be held accountable for its egregious crimes."""
NL_077	25	The EU has long been looking for ways to assist Ukraine in war crimes trials.
NL_077	26	For example, the Netherlands already sent forensic experts.
NL_077	27	Ukraine Tribunal.
NL_077	28	The International Criminal Court in The Hague is also already dealing with war crimes in Ukraine, but has no jurisdiction to judge the decision to invade.
NL_077	29	The new International Center for the Prosecution of Crime of Aggression should be the precursor to a special Ukraine tribunal where Russian leaders can indeed be tried.
NL_077	30	So the EU delegation's main concern was to press Ukraine to its chest.
NL_077	31	But the EU summit, EU diplomats said beforehand, also had the goal of dampening Ukraine's enthusiasm about joining the EU soon.
NL_077	32	Ukraine received EU candidate status last spring and, like all prospective members, must now meet European criteria in a wide range of areas.
NL_077	33	That process normally takes years, but Ukraine recently said it hopes to join in 2026.
NL_077	34	The European baggage therefore includes the message that Ukraine must meet the same requirements as everyone else.
NL_077	35	Progress is good and the EU hopes Kiev can keep up the momentum despite the burden of the war, but no one wants to commit to dates, a diplomat said.
NL_077	36	One issue on which Ukraine traditionally scored poorly was corruption.
NL_082	1	Ecology Nature policy, built up over decades, is being scrapped As nature continues to deteriorate, the VVD wants to lower the bar for what nature is just a little.
NL_082	2	"Hans Kampf feels ""grossly miffed."""
NL_082	3	Dutch nature policy, built up over decades, is in danger of creeping demolition.
NL_082	4	The idea of a Main Ecological Structure (EHS), a coherent network of existing and future natural areas, has existed since 1990, and has since served as an example for many countries in and outside Europe.
NL_082	5	Hans Kampf was senior policy advisor on Nature at the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) and is a volunteer nature manager in a Natura 2000 low moor bog area near Utrecht.
NL_082	6	"The Nature Policy Plan Nature for People, People for Nature (2000) solidified ""green"" and ""blue"" connections, with the financial basis for the sites of the Forestry Commission and those of private organizations such as Natuurmonumenten, provincial landscapes and a group of private landowners."
NL_082	7	The icing on the cake was Natura 2000, which, at the invitation of the European Commission, designated natural areas of special European significance.
NL_082	8	This in addition to the other natural areas as part of the EHS, which since 2013 has been called Natuurnetwerk Nederland.
NL_082	9	The Rutte I administration (2010-12) was a disaster for nature policy.
NL_082	10	Under State Secretary Henk Bleker (Agriculture and Nature, CDA), more than 100,000 hectares of connectivity zones and land acquisition were cut, while Staatsbosbeheer was slashed in the budget.
NL_082	11	Bleker and his political seconds acted as mouthpieces for the farmers who cause the agricultural nitrogen problem with their intensive methods, while farmers who advocate a different relationship with nature were not taken at face value.
NL_082	12	Balance of deterioration.
NL_082	13	It is obvious that this comes at the expense of livability, now and for future generations.
NL_082	14	The balance: peat meadows that continue to shrink due to continuous drainage for agricultural purposes; grasslands that still consist solely of a few high-yielding grasses without the flowering plants that are also important for our food because of pollinating insects.
NL_082	15	Explosions of pests due to the lack of ecological regulators; soils where soil life is eroding in quality even for sustainable agriculture due to permanent over-fertilization; biodiversity-less corn fields that can also take a lot of manure; meadow birds locked in reserves while farmers promised otherwise; a virtually treeless, high-speed demolished landscape for which farmers have supposedly guaranteed for decades.
NL_082	16	Nitrogen clouds everywhere, phosphate in the water of our natural areas, water that has gone from crystal clear to murky in a few years, resulting in a collapsed dragonfly population, butterflies under pressure.
NL_082	17	And so on.
NL_082	18	Nature gone, problem solved.
NL_082	19	"But you can also say, as the VVD now seems to be doing with the trial balloon to ""adjust"" the protected status of some Natura 2000 areas, ""merge"" or eliminate smaller areas: nature gone, problem solved."
NL_082	20	Briefly then.
NL_082	21	As a retired senior policy advisor on Nature at the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, I feel grossly miffed.
NL_082	22	Regarding the Natura 2000 and Habitat Directives, I count on Europe in any case.
NL_082	23	But for the preservation and restoration of our other natural areas - for ourselves, our children and future generations - it is all hands on deck regardless.
NL_101	1	Opinion Jonas De Raeve Do we finally dare to look beyond the teaching certificate?
NL_101	2	22 min Last week, the Flemish government selected for the first time 10 professions for which you can have competencies recognized and certified with a professional qualification.
NL_101	3	These competencies may be acquired through training or experience.
NL_101	4	A professional qualification should be worth as much in the labor market as an educational diploma.
NL_101	5	After all, they guarantee that the necessary competencies have been acquired, regardless of what training or experience preceded this.
NL_101	6	It is an important step toward competency-based thinking and much needed in a rapidly changing job market.
NL_101	7	But the potential of professional qualifications is much greater than we can estimate today.
NL_101	8	They could eventually shake up the entire education and training landscape and will allow workers to increase their employability.
NL_101	9	The government, education and training providers and also employers must then dare to take big steps forward.
NL_101	10	The coalition agreement already offers opportunities with the lifelong learning platform.
NL_101	11	The government could identify which competencies you already possess and which you still need to acquire to obtain a professional qualification.
NL_101	12	If, at the same time, it is clear via a learning account what training rights and budget you can use to follow additional training, we can really work on a learning culture in Flanders.
NL_101	13	Education will also have to embrace professional qualifications.
NL_101	14	Fearful of breaking their monopoly on degree delivery and on determining the content of educational curricula, they invariably put the brakes on policy discussions.
NL_101	15	However, vocational qualifications offer many opportunities to better match technical and labor market-oriented training to labor market needs in secondary education and to provide more flexible lifelong learning offerings in higher education.
NL_101	16	In addition, a vocational qualifying apprenticeship would be a good alternative for the group that cannot enter dual learning today because the school component is too heavy.
NL_101	17	Thus, we can finally reduce the unqualified outflow.
NL_101	18	Perhaps recognizing professional qualifications could even be part of the solution to the teacher shortage?
NL_101	19	If we make better use of the competencies available, perhaps we can still achieve the high ambition of raising the employment rate to 80%.
NL_101	20	Employers have created hundreds of professional qualifications in recent years.
NL_101	21	For nearly 500 occupations, they created a detailed list of required knowledge and skills needed to perform the job.
NL_101	22	Now it is time for this time investment to begin to pay off and for the qualifications to find their way into the job market.
NL_101	23	Employers can also do their part by recognizing the importance of professional qualifications in hiring and performance reviews.
NL_101	24	It helps them put the right employee in the right place, assess whether additional training or different job duties are feasible and what competencies still need to be acquired.
NL_101	25	A strong awareness campaign with concrete examples should support this.
NL_101	26	If we succeed in increasing the social value of vocational qualifications, we can make great strides in lifelong learning and eliminate the current mismatch between education and the labor market.
NL_101	27	If we make better use of the available competencies, perhaps we can still achieve the high ambition of the Flemish government to raise the employment rate to 80%.
NL_101	28	But then we will have to abandon the idea that only a teaching degree is blissful.
NL_102	1	Consumer & Corona When will the bank defer my mortgage payments?
NL_102	2	This section addresses corona-related consumer law questions about work, finance and leisure.
NL_102	3	The issue.
NL_102	4	"Even before Prime Minister Rutte coined the term ""intelligent lockdown,"" the first Dutch banks were at it: promising to help customers who ran into financial trouble as a result of the corona crisis."
NL_102	5	Making mortgage repayments was unnecessary for now, and interest payments were suspended, banks reported in mid-March.
NL_102	6	"""Banks are now part of the solution, not the problem,"" ABN Amro chief Kees van Dijkhuizen outlined the setup, citing the 2008 financial crisis."
NL_102	7	What exactly does this payment break look like?
NL_102	8	And to whom does it apply?
NL_102	9	Here's how it is.
NL_102	10	The answer to that question depends on the mortgage lender.
NL_102	11	"Almost all have now rigged ""corona schemes"" for customers in financial trouble: from ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank to insurers like Aegon and new players like Munt Hypotheken and Florius."
NL_102	12	The idea behind it is the same: a payment break for customers in need.
NL_102	13	But because each financial institution has devised its own scheme, there is no set framework on the basis of which, as a homeowner, you can easily see whether you qualify for such a payment break and for how long.
NL_102	14	The payment break at ABN Amro, for example, applies by default for three months and (because of the rush due to the number of applications) may not take effect until June 1.
NL_102	15	"ING, on the other hand, immediately suspends mortgage payments and uses ""a term by mutual agreement,"" instead of three months."
NL_102	16	Approaches to making up for missed mortgage payments also differ among mortgage lenders.
NL_102	17	"At ABN Amro, the three missed months of interest and redemption are spread out over the period to Dec. 31, 2021, while Rabobank merely states, ""we'll make arrangements about that later."""
NL_102	18	The three largest banks do not charge additional fees for the missed months, they say.
NL_102	19	Mortgage payments must still be paid, but there is no additional cost to take advantage of the scheme.
NL_102	20	"Thus, the ""late payment interest,"" which is normally charged when a mortgagee falls behind on repayment, does not apply."
NL_102	21	The contrast with Belgium, which also has a pay break, is considerable.
NL_102	22	The Belgian pause came about after consultations between the central bank, the finance ministry and the banking umbrella.
NL_102	23	As a result, a uniform maximum six-month payment break will apply to consumers who have no more than 25,000 euros in their savings accounts.
NL_102	24	ABN Amro, Rabobank and ING have no such financial buffer limit, they said when asked.
NL_102	25	"ING stresses that customers should contact it and ""not wait until their buffer is completely gone."""
NL_102	26	"ABN Amro says it is discussing with customers ""whether a payment break is the best solution."""
NL_102	27	"""If there is (a lot of) savings present, it is obvious that the customer will use it first."""
NL_102	28	"Dutch banks' criteria ""are rather vague,"" notes attorney Thomas van Vugt of AMS Lawyers."
NL_102	29	Above all, the key question remains unclear: when are your financial problems serious enough to qualify for the break?
NL_102	30	Van Vugt points out that although the payment break is a gesture by the bank, this does not mean that the bank may use it arbitrarily.
NL_102	31	The banks decided to make the offer, and that brings with it certain responsibilities and a duty of care.
NL_102	32	"""If people substantiate that they have financial problems or foresee them as a result of the coronavirus, then as a bank you cannot simply say that someone is not entitled to the payment break."
NL_102	33	"When in doubt, the decision should be in favor of the customer."""
NL_102	34	The answer.
NL_102	35	Because each mortgage lender has designed its own corona scheme, there is no uniform rule for who gets a payment break on their mortgage and for how long it applies.
NL_102	36	The pay break is a gesture and not a right.
NL_102	37	Nevertheless, mortgage lenders - now that they offer the breaks - may not simply refuse them if customers plausibly demonstrate that they have financial corona problems.

NL_103	1	Need for European solidarity more than ever
NL_103	2	The global shock of the corona pandemic affects all European countries.
NL_103	3	Europe is experiencing its worst health crisis since the Spanish flu.
NL_103	4	European economies will suffer much more damage than initially thought.
NL_103	5	Therefore, a well-coordinated policy response is needed, both among member states and at the European level.
NL_103	6	It is crucial to minimize economic damage and maintain financial stability.
NL_103	7	Once the health crisis is under control, we must prepare for economic recovery.
NL_103	8	The seriousness of the medical situation and the extent of the expected economic and social damage makes European solidarity urgent.
NL_103	9	Member states have taken hefty fiscal measures against economic damage.
NL_103	10	Fiscal measures are estimated to average 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020.
NL_103	11	Programs to support liquidity through government guarantees and tax deferrals for businesses and individuals exceed 13 percent of GDP.
NL_103	12	Complementing those national measures requires a coordinated approach at the European level.
NL_103	13	"The European Commission has relaxed state aid rules and, together with the European Council, activated the ""escape clause"" of the budget rules, allowing countries to increase budget spending."
NL_103	14	Action by the European Central Bank is crucial to keep banks and financial markets functioning.
NL_103	15	The question is what else is possible now and in the near future at the European level.
NL_103	16	How can Europe quickly mobilize additional funding to support governments, businesses and citizens in all EU member states?
NL_103	17	In the short term and at least before 2020, European solidarity must be shaped by the rapid use of existing European institutions - the Commission, the Investment Bank (EIB) and the Stability Mechanism (ESM) - and the instruments at their disposal.
NL_103	18	The European Commission has announced unemployment insurance to secure as many jobs as possible.
NL_103	19	In addition, the 37 billion euros from the Corona Response Investment Initiative will be used to support health care, SMEs and the labor market.
NL_103	20	The European Investment Bank proposes a pan-European guarantee fund.
NL_103	21	In it, €25 billion worth of guarantees would come from member states, which could then be leveraged to mobilize an additional €200 billion for SMEs, midcaps and companies in the real economy.
NL_103	22	The European Emergency Fund ESM has 410 billion euros of ammunition and can provide credit at low interest rates.
NL_103	23	The ESM's toolbox includes different financial instruments for different circumstances.
NL_103	24	Currently, the so-called precautionary lines of credit - never before deployed - seem most appropriate.
NL_103	25	Such credits offer the advantage that money can flow quickly if a country needs urgent support because the facility is already in position.
NL_103	26	If the Investment Bank and the ESM push the gas pedal further, they will have to issue bonds to finance their lending.
NL_103	27	The Investment Bank - and to a lesser extent the Commission - issue such debt for all 27 member states, and the ESM emergency fund for the 19 eurozone countries.
NL_103	28	Those three institutions have been issuing so-called mutualized debt securities, i.e. European debt, for years.
NL_103	29	Today they have about 800 billion euros of debt outstanding.
NL_103	30	All three provide financing at interest rates well below the financing cost of most member states.
NL_103	31	They have also proven to be efficient and successful even in the face of substantial economic headwinds.
NL_103	32	This time they can do even more.
NL_103	33	Proposals are circulating to create new institutions or new financial instruments.
NL_103	34	But that takes time, time we don't have.
NL_103	35	At the beginning of the euro crisis, the first temporary bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, took seven months to issue its first bond.
NL_103	36	And that was already one with a rocky pace compared to similar institutions, which took three years.
NL_103	37	Creating new European debt requires capital, guarantees or allocated revenues, as well as a well-functioning legal and governance system.
NL_103	38	Therefore, it is best to use all the existing institutions and instruments that have been successfully mobilizing large sums for years.
NL_103	39	Looking beyond 2020, solutions beyond that are possible and necessary to help European economies recover from this shock.
NL_103	40	As announced by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the next multi-year budget focuses on combating the economic impact of the corona crisis.
NL_103	41	The focus could then be on member states facing particularly negative economic consequences.
NL_103	42	For the next few years, Italy best not be a net contributor to the European budget.
NL_103	43	In addition, the EIB may increase its capital to lend more money in the coming years.
NL_103	44	And the ESM has borrowing capacity available.
NL_106	1	British newspapers on Harry and Meghan's 'Megxit':
NL_106	2	"""Saddened Queen knew of nothing, Charles and William are furious"""
NL_106	3	Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle's announcement that they are stepping down from the British royal family is generating much speculation in British newspapers.
NL_106	4	More than the announcement itself, they focus on the fact that the two had not informed anyone, not even Queen Elizabeth.
NL_106	5	2019 was a tumultuous year for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
NL_106	6	They became the parents of Archie, a hefty boy now eight months old, and were frequently the subject of stories in the tabloid press after his birth.
NL_106	7	Meghan in particular took the brunt of it: she was portrayed as a wayward and stuck-up royal who lacked respect for the people who work for her.
NL_106	8	Harry strenuously denied those reports and almost begged the tabloids not to do to her what they did to his mother - Princess Diana.
NL_106	9	READ ALSO.
NL_106	10	Wednesday's announcement, that Harry and Meghan are stepping down from the British royal family , certainly has to do with those events of the past year, according to insiders.
NL_106	11	"Yet the newspapers and public broadcaster BBC mainly focus on the fact that the ""Megxit"" announcement was made without first informing their relatives."
NL_106	12	Royal House outraged.
NL_106	13	The sun , the tabloid that the royals are waging a public war against, let a source within the royal family speak.
NL_106	14	"""They broke protocol by stepping out of their roles without consulting other royals about it."
NL_106	15	"Prince Charles and Prince William are seething with anger, this is a declaration of war on the family."""
NL_106	16	"Queen Elizabeth, who was also uninformed, is said to be ""deeply saddened"" by Harry and Meghan's decision."
NL_106	17	READ ALSO.
NL_106	18	Also against The daily mirror Drastic decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was coming: read again their candid interview here (+) a lawsuit by Harry and Meghan is underway, and that newspaper is not too positive either.
NL_106	19	"""They didn't even tell the Queen,"" reads big on the front page."
NL_106	20	"A source told the newspaper that the couple shows a ""complete lack of respect for the institution."""
NL_106	21	"Daily mail, in turn, talks about a ""furious"" Queen."
NL_106	22	The daily telegraph calls it another shock to the royal family, after the fuss over Prince Andrew had already caused a difficult year end there as well.
NL_106	23	(continue reading below photo)
NL_106	24	British public broadcaster BBC also carded that other members of the royal family have been hurt by Harry and Meghan's departure.
NL_106	25	"Analysts also make it clear that a ""logistical nightmare"" awaits, as moving to North America or Canada sounds easier for royals than it really is."
NL_106	26	"""There is still a lot to be done to arrange that move,"" it sounds."
NL_106	27	"""And negotiations on that are still at a very early stage."""
NL_106	28	Fear of health.
NL_106	29	But there are also newspapers that looked for the reasons behind the decision.
NL_106	30	For example, Metro states that there are growing fears about the couple's mental health and much speculation about growing discontent between Harry and William in recent months.
NL_106	31	"""Harry and Meghan have had great anxiety for months about their role within the family,"" writes The times ."
NL_106	32	"According to that newspaper, the decision of the ""evil"" couple must be sought there."
NL_106	33	It will also mark the start of a feud within the family, it sounds.
NL_106	34	"The Guardian expressed just about the only admiration for Harry and Meghan's brave decision, ""after a period filled with public hostility toward the media over alleged intrusion and harassment."""
NL_111	1	New CEO Mercedes struggles with legacy from past
NL_111	2	'We would have loved to welcome you to our booth in Geneva, but health is more important.'
NL_111	3	As the world's most important auto show was canceled due to the encroaching corona virus, Daimler CEO Ola Källenius addressed the press in a teleconference on Tuesday.
NL_111	4	Although more and more carmakers are staying away from expensive saloons, the successor to legendary Mercedes executive Dieter Zetsche swears allegiance to the concept.
NL_111	5	'Car shows remain attractive; we'll come back as soon as we can.'
NL_111	6	Källenius (50) has his hands full with the coronavirus.
NL_111	7	Daimler's factories in China, which closed a week longer early this year, are getting back up to cruising speed.
NL_111	8	In the European plants, the virus is not causing any problems for the time being, according to the CEO.
NL_111	9	'Our supply chain is global.
NL_111	10	We work closely with our suppliers in China.
NL_111	11	It is too early to say what the total impact will be.
NL_111	12	Our team looks in detail at what happens in every factory in the world.
NL_111	13	It's day-to-day management.
NL_111	14	Like the competition, Källenius expects a temporary slump in car sales.
NL_111	15	"""Corona certainly put a damper on sales in China in the first quarter."
NL_111	16	But I remain cautiously optimistic about the underlying demand for cars.
NL_111	17	Thanks to the refreshed model lineup, Mercedes posted record sales in 2019.
NL_111	18	But that growth did not translate into profits.
NL_111	19	Daimler's auto branch saw its ebitda halve to 3.4 billion euros last year.
NL_111	20	"Källenius attributes that decline mainly to ""issues from the past."
NL_111	21	While rival Volkswagen was labeled a diesel sundowner with its tampering software, Daimler did not prove to be the good guy either.
NL_111	22	The German government fined the company 870 million euros last year for manipulated emissions values.
NL_111	23	The question of whether he expects any more problems causes Källenius to stutter.
NL_111	24	'Some proceedings are still ongoing....
NL_111	25	Euh, it's not wise to talk about details when we're still talking to governments.
NL_111	26	Daimler is also chasing in the electric field.
NL_111	27	Only last year did it launch its first all-electric model, the large SUV EQC.
NL_111	28	Daimler is mainly counting on Smart for electrification.
NL_111	29	Mercedes is now positioning the city car, which never really made a profit, as an all-electric brand.
NL_111	30	Before that, Källenius parked Smart in a joint venture with Chinese group Geely.
NL_111	31	Li Shufu, the owner of Geely, recently became a major shareholder in Daimler and he owns Volvo.
NL_111	32	About synergies with the Swedish premium brand, Daimler's Swedish CEO remains on the record.
NL_111	33	'Our cooperation with Geely is going very well,' says Källenius.
NL_111	34	'Thanks to Geely, we are increasing our footprint.
NL_111	35	That could lead to greater opportunities.
NL_111	36	I can't say anything concrete about that today, but we are open to the possibilities.
NL_111	37	Daimler urgently needs to sell more electric cars if it does not want to pay European millions in fines.
NL_111	38	Tighter CO2 emissions targets are a problem for the heavy Mercedes fleet. '2020 and 2021 will be a challenge.
NL_111	39	We are within shooting distance, although everything depends on sales.
NL_111	40	But mentally and technically we made the click.
NL_111	41	We want our cars to be carbon neutral by 2039 at the latest.'
NL_111	42	Unlike other automakers, Mercedes refuses to write off the classic internal combustion engine.
NL_111	43	'The internal combustion engine will be with us for a long time.
NL_111	44	By 2030, 50 percent of our sales must be electric or hybrid.
NL_111	45	So it will still exist after 2030.
NL_111	46	I don't want to put a date on the internal combustion engine.
NL_111	47	It's still important to make those more efficient.
NL_111	48	The malaise at Mercedes is making itself felt on the stock market.
NL_111	49	A Daimler share, worth 93 euros five years ago, costs 38 euros today.
NL_111	50	"""There is a general nervousness in the market about the transformation of the auto industry,"" Källenius says."
NL_111	51	'That applies to almost all car companies.
NL_111	52	Where will the journey to electrification end?
NL_111	53	What is the impact of digitization?
NL_111	54	How do we transform our business model?
NL_111	55	Those questions will play out for several more years.
NL_122	1	"Politicians do listen to proposal from French-speaking scientists, but barbers immediately shoot down plan: ""Where do you draw the line?"""
NL_122	2	"The scientists - epidemiologist Marius Gilbert (ULB) and infectiologists Nathan Clumeck (CHU Sint-Pieter) and Leila Belkhir (UZ Sint-Lucas, Woluwe) - propose in an opinion piece in the newspaper ""Le Soir"" that a ""Covid safe"" label should henceforth be awarded to establishments based on a number of parameters, such as good ventilation, duration of exposure or mouth masking."
NL_122	3	They additionally advocate divisions within sectors, and want self-testing to play a role as well.
NL_122	4	That way, they want to avoid yo-yo movements, where sectors have to keep closing and reopening.
NL_122	5	"""We took this initiative based on what all is happening now,"" Professor Clumeck explained Monday night on ""Terzake."
NL_122	6	According to the infectiologist, for many people, the strain is out after a year of corona measures.
NL_122	7	"""There are gatherings of young people, illegal restaurants and most recently (in Antwerp, ed.) the tragedy of the boy who died trying to flee from the police."""
NL_122	8	According to Clumeck, we are therefore at a breaking point in Belgium.
NL_122	9	"""If we do nothing and continue like this, I fear there will be more protests, resulting in more repression and possibly more violence."""
NL_122	10	Political interest.
NL_122	11	The proposals already have the support of the French-speaking federal majority parties.
NL_122	12	"For PS Chairman Paul Magnette, it is ""a very interesting contribution to the debate on the evolution of our strategy."
NL_122	13	In addition to vaccination, a serious course of action is to phase out of the current carcan.
NL_122	14	"I want the proposal to be thoroughly examined as soon as possible,"" the president of the French-speaking Socialists announced on Twitter."
NL_122	15	Flemish mayors are also showing interest.
NL_122	16	At the local level, Flemish mayors also seem to have ears for the proposal.
NL_122	17	"""This certainly offers opportunities to gradually come back out of the lockdown, because people are getting tired of it,"" Wim Dries (CD&V), mayor of Genk and president of the Association of Flemish Cities and Municipalities, told VRT NWS."
NL_122	18	"And Aalsters Mayor Christoph D'Haese (N-VA) also called the ideas of the French-speaking scientists ""a constructive approach because we really do have to start looking at this health crisis in a different way."""
NL_122	19	According to D'Haese, there is too much focus on corona numbers and not enough on mental well-being and the economy.
NL_122	20	"""Where do you draw the line?"""
NL_122	21	However, among the Belgian Beauty Federation and United Hairdressers, two federations for hairdressers and beauticians in our country, the enthusiasm is a lot less than among politicians.
NL_122	22	Many hairdressers and beauticians do not see a division in terms of treatments, according to the federations.
NL_122	23	"""Where do you ultimately draw the line?"
NL_122	24	"Then a barber is not going to be able to open the door, and the vast majority of beauty salon treatments are done in the face, so they will remain closed as well."""
NL_122	25	"According to the federations, there is no significant difference between contact occupations in terms of infection rate, ""so the theory is wrong."""
NL_122	26	The proposal to add self-testing to the current protocol also falls on a cold stone.
NL_122	27	The federations cite a survey that would show that six in 10 (surveyed) salon owners no longer want an additional measure.
NL_122	28	"""There is no sector that has had so many measures imposed on it and that with the promise that we could stay open,"" said Mario Blokken, president of the Belgian Beauty Federation."
NL_122	29	"""While medical contact professions such as dentists and physiotherapists do not even have to apply half as many measures."
NL_122	30	Continuing this unreasonable approach is unmentionable for the industry.
NL_122	31	"We no longer accept two weights and measures for the contact professions."""
NL_122	32	"The federations maintain that they nevertheless remain ""constructive."""
NL_122	33	Further, it sounds that the barbers and beauty specialists are simply counting on being able to reopen on April 26, the date that was predetermined that they would have to remain closed at least until then.
NL_122	34	"The federations also argue that a financial recovery plan is ""a must."""

NL_145	1	Doing Green With tens of thousands not buying clothes for a summer Every week NRC guides you toward sustainable living.
NL_145	2	You have six more days to make your move in the sale before the 2019 Slow Fashion Season begins on June 21.
NL_145	3	It would actually be better called No Fashion Season, because it is a global action in which people promise not to buy clothes for three calendar months.
NL_145	4	That is, no new ones.
NL_145	5	Exchanges and buying second-hand are allowed.
NL_145	6	This is the second time the action has been organized.
NL_145	7	Last year, 2,625 people participated.
NL_145	8	At the time of writing, nearly 5,500 people have committed through slowfashionseason.org .
NL_145	9	The goal is 10,000 non-buyers; registration is open until next Friday.
NL_145	10	That we all buy way too many clothes should come as no surprise; just look at the barely-worn or even completely unworn pieces that you yourself undoubtedly have in your closet.
NL_145	11	Collaction, the organization behind the action, cites a few figures on the environmental impact of the fashion industry.
NL_145	12	Each year, 32 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water are used - just making a cotton T-shirt requires 2,700 liters - and the industry accounts for 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
NL_145	13	"Then there's dyeing (""the biggest polluter of clean water after agriculture""), the huge amount of clothes thrown away and the, to put it mildly, not ideal working conditions under which many clothes are produced, among other things."
NL_145	14	If 10,000 people do not buy new items for three months, 360 million liters of water will be saved and 1.4 million fewer kilograms of CO 2 will be emitted, according to Collaction.
NL_145	15	Malpractice.
NL_145	16	Aren't you depriving textile workers who already have so little of much needed work with the action?
NL_145	17	Slow Fashion Season's Dutch ambassador, Babette Porcelijn, doesn't think so.
NL_145	18	Porcelijn is the author of the book The Hidden Impact (2017), in which she exposes the environmental impact of our consumption behavior.
NL_145	19	Clothing ranks number eight on her top ten polluting consumption list, right after the bathroom category, assuming that the average Dutch person buys three items of clothing, each weighing half a kilo a month.
NL_145	20	"""There are so many abuses in the garment industry that I see it as a modern form of slavery."
NL_145	21	The system is just not right.
NL_145	22	"If you want to offer something to the people there, you better look for fair trade clothing."""
NL_145	23	For Porcelain himself, by the way, the action is hardly a sacrifice.
NL_145	24	"""I already buy very little."""
NL_146	1	Top Kim-Putin Kim warns: only peace if US adopts more lenient stance The North Korean leader is not satisfied with the outcome of his latest meeting with Trump, he revealed during his visit to Russia.
NL_146	2	Only if the United States becomes more flexible and weakens sanctions against North Korea can the impasse in negotiations be broken.
NL_146	3	That is what North Korean leader Kim Jong-un told Russian President Vladimir Putin during the summit in Vladivostok, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported.
NL_146	4	According to Kim, tensions with the US could easily return.
NL_146	5	"He says he is prepared for ""every possible outcome."""
NL_146	6	"The North Korean leader also told Putin that the US was ""in bad faith"" at the denuclearization summit between Trump and Kim in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi."
NL_146	7	Kim had also previously expressed his unhappiness with the outcome of that February summit, which ended prematurely.
NL_146	8	He even threatened to resume testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles if sanctions against his country are not lifted.
NL_146	9	He did say earlier this month that he was still open to a third summit with Trump.
NL_146	10	Solid discussion.
NL_146	11	Kim and Putin met for the first time on Thursday.
NL_146	12	In front of the press, the two shook hands in Vladivostok, in Russia's far east.
NL_146	13	They then held talks with each other behind closed doors.
NL_146	14	It was the first time in eight years that the heads of state of Russia and North Korea have met.
NL_146	15	At the time, Kim's father Kim Jong-il met with then-Russian President Dimitri Medvedev.
NL_146	16	"Putin said after the summit that the two had had ""a solid discussion."""
NL_146	17	The leaders discussed, among other things, how to resolve the conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
NL_146	18	"In addition, Putin promised to help end the ""nuclear standoff"" and said his country wants to help Kim ""normalize ties between North Korea and the United States."""
NL_146	19	However, he did not mention any concrete solutions or measures.
NL_146	20	"Kim called it ""a fruitful conversation"" afterwards, and at the end of the summit, the North Korean leader invited Putin to Pyongyang."
NL_146	21	The Russian president responded, according to KCNA.
NL_146	22	The White House has not yet responded to Kim and Putin's statements.
NL_146	23	A U.S. diplomat did say that North Korea's attempts to connect with Russia prove that sanctions against the North Korean regime are working.

NL_151	2	And at what price?
NL_151	3	Is it acceptable to win large, lucrative contracts in countries that do not take human rights seriously?
NL_151	4	And at what price?
NL_151	5	That Dutch companies may pay bribes for foreign contracts is well known - virtuous does not.
NL_151	6	Consider the investigations into unfair trade practices by shipbuilder Damen, offshore company SBM, development bank FMO.
NL_151	7	When human rights are violated, moral responsibility weighs more heavily.
NL_151	8	Last weekend, more was revealed about the roles of dredging company Van Oord, ING and the Dutch state's credit insurer Atradius in a major urban renewal project, Corimba Boulevard, in the Angolan capital, Luanda.
NL_151	9	To make that possible, three thousand families were forcibly evicted from their homes.
NL_151	10	Some of them now live in a garbage dump.
NL_151	11	"""Army and police arranged to deprive residents of food and hardly any water for a week, beating residents and spraying with tear gas and hot water cannons,"" wrote Trouw, which interviewed evicted residents."
NL_151	12	The publication came as part of the ICIJ, the international consortium of investigative journalists, on the Angola land grab.
NL_151	13	And the billions that disappeared in the process into the pockets of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president.
NL_151	14	ICIJ obtained 715,000 documents from Dos Santos' private administration through African whistleblowers.
NL_151	15	"The estimated wealth of this ""richest woman in Africa"" is two billion euros."
NL_151	16	"A Dos Santos company, Urbinvest, was client of the ""Corimba Boulevard"" for which Van Oord would connect several islets off the coast of the metropolis of millions."
NL_151	17	ING helped finance the project by providing a $400 million (over 360 million euros) loan to the Angolan state.
NL_151	18	Atradius insured that sum.
NL_151	19	The Dutch companies now say they did not know about the forced moves nor about Dos Santos' reputation.
NL_151	20	That defense is weak: Dos Santos has been under fire since 2013 for the dubious origin of its billions.
NL_151	21	For this project, her company claimed millions in vague costs.
NL_151	22	"Experts say in both papers that several ""red flags"" for possible corruption have been blatantly ignored."
NL_151	23	Van Oord could have known about the evictions.
NL_151	24	The company says it only signed the contract in 2016, but the documents show that talks about the project were underway before the three thousand families were evicted.
NL_151	25	That Minister Sigrid Kaag (Foreign Trade, D66) now wants to talk to Van Oord is a first step.
NL_151	26	But a slap on the wrist by the Cabinet gives no guarantee that Dutch companies will then show social responsibility.
NL_151	27	For that, the rules are simply too lenient - and the loopholes too wide.
NL_151	28	Perhaps the settlements that the prosecution tends to make in such cases are not so apt to raise moral standards after all.
NL_151	29	The fact that shadowy constructions run through the Netherlands, as the investigation shows, doesn't help either.
NL_151	30	Many of Dos Santos' interests in oil telecom and diamond companies were handled through Dutch letterbox firms.
NL_151	31	The Dutch Central Bank had these tax shortcuts in its sights as early as 2012.
NL_151	32	But again, signaling is not yet punishing.
NL_151	33	Better supervision is needed, as is more self-understanding and clearer moral frameworks.
NL_151	34	Enforcement is always a capstone.

NL_155	16	The numbers are higher than those of the RIVM, because this institute records an infection only if it is detected by a test.
NL_155	17	"""These new figures show how important it is that we all take our social responsibility to protect the vulnerable in our society,"" said Verenso president Nienke Nieuwenhuizen."
NL_155	18	"""We cannot afford for the number of corona patients in nursing homes to skyrocket."

NL_155	22	The KNVB, Eredivisie CV and Coöperatie Eerste Divisie are currently working with two scenarios.
NL_155	23	The first is that the season - if deemed safe by the RIVM - will resume and be completed by Aug. 3.

NL_155	25	Neurologists also appeal: keep going to specialist In addition to cardiologists, neurologists are now appealing to patients to keep going to specialist.
NL_155	26	The Brain Foundation and the Dutch Society for Neurology write that people are avoiding the family doctor and neurologist because they fear getting infected with the coronavirus.
NL_155	27	They also do not want to burden caregivers.
NL_155	28	"""This is dangerous and unnecessary behavior,"" said Jennifer Huizer, director of the Dutch Society of Neurology."

NL_155	30	"Merel Heimens Visser, director of the Brain Foundation, agrees: ""Not going to the specialist after a brain infarction, TIA or cerebral hemorrhage can lead to life-threatening situations."
NL_155	31	"If action is not taken in time, more serious and lasting damage occurs."""

NL_157	1	Deal on historic cut in oil production is in place
NL_157	2	After days of negotiations, the ball seems to be in the court.
NL_157	3	During final consultations Sunday night, the member states of the Opec oil cartel reached an agreement with a host of other oil producers such as Russia, Mexico and the United States to cut oil production.
NL_157	4	This was confirmed by Saudi, Kuwaiti and Mexican ministers.
NL_157	5	As of May 1, Opec+ - an alliance of Opec members that includes producers such as Russia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Oman and Sudan - was pumping 9.7 million barrels less oil daily.
NL_157	6	That amounts to some 10 percent of global production.
NL_157	7	The measure will remain in effect for at least two months.
NL_157	8	Never before did oil producers agree on such a large production cut.
NL_157	9	The historic deal was largely in place by Friday.
NL_157	10	Saudi Arabia and Russia would each cut 2.5 million barrels while the remaining Opec+ member states would together pump another 5 million barrels less each day.
NL_157	11	But they coupled this with an important condition.
NL_157	12	The United States and Mexico should also make an effort.
NL_157	13	Otherwise, the demarche may well be a slap in the face and the desired effect - a rise in the price of oil - may fail to materialize.
NL_157	14	Mexico, however, played the game hard.
NL_157	15	It did not see fit to cut its production by 400,000 barrels a day.
NL_157	16	That persistence seems to have paid off.
NL_157	17	Under Sunday night's deal, the contents of which have not yet been officially disclosed, the Latin American country should eventually drop its production by only 100,000 barrels per day.
NL_157	18	According to news agency Bloomberg, theUnited States, Canada and Brazil together are scaling back their daily production by 3.7 million barrels.
NL_157	19	That they agreed to that measure is not too big a surprise.
NL_157	20	Due to the corona pandemic and its associated impact on the economy, demand for the black gold was down anyway.
NL_157	21	Analysts estimate that demand is down by a third now that about half the world's population is in a lockdown regime.
NL_157	22	The key question is whether the historic deal is enough to put a floor under oil prices.
NL_157	23	The price for a barrel of Brent oil fell to its lowest level in 18 years due to the corona crisis.
NL_157	24	Recently, it even dipped below $25 a barrel for a while.
NL_157	25	Goldman Sachs and UBS predicted last week that a 15 percent contraction in oil production would not even be enough to stop the price drop.
NL_157	26	They did not rule out a drop in the price of a barrel of Brent oil to $20, down from $70 at the beginning of the year.
NL_163	1	1,700 additional spots needed for minor asylum seekers
NL_163	2	By January 1, 1,700 additional reception places are needed for minor aliens (unaccompanied minors), writes State Secretary Eric van der Burg (Asylum Affairs) to municipalities.
NL_163	3	If this is not taken care of, there is a risk that these children will have to sleep outside or roam in search of shelter.
NL_163	4	Low point.
NL_163	5	"In his letter, the secretary of state calls on all municipalities ""urgently to avoid this absolute low."
NL_163	6	Van der Burg makes the call partly on behalf of the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) and guardianship organization Nidos.
NL_163	7	Currently, 100 to 150 minors are knocking on Ter Apel's door for asylum every week.
NL_163	8	In recent weeks, these children have regularly had to sleep on chairs because there is no bed for them.
NL_163	9	Ter Apel.
NL_163	10	Far too many children are accommodated at the various special reception sites for minor asylum seekers.
NL_163	11	The maximum capacity is far exceeded in a number of locations.
NL_163	12	"""Most worrisome"" is the situation in Ter Apel, Van der Burg writes."
NL_163	13	A maximum of 55 children can be accommodated there, but occupancy has far exceeded that for more than a year and a half.
NL_163	14	"""That ranged from more than 200 to days where the occupancy was even more than 300 amv."
NL_163	15	Unacceptable.
NL_163	16	"Not only does the Cabinet believe that ""something must be done urgently about this situation,"" but also Unicef, the Dutch Refugee Council and the Justice and Security and Health and Youth Inspectorates, among others."
NL_163	17	They argue that the hygiene, welfare and safety of both the youth and staff are at stake.
NL_163	18	'This is unacceptable as far as I am concerned,' Van der Burg writes.
NL_163	19	Insufficient.
NL_163	20	So far, he believes, municipalities are not sufficiently forthcoming.
NL_163	21	The minister asks municipalities to still provide locations where 50 to 80 minor foreign nationals can be structurally accommodated.
NL_163	22	And again, he asks each county to release 25 to 30 single-family homes for this group.
NL_163	23	COA will look for additional space within existing and new asylum seekers' centers (azc's) to accommodate children.
NL_163	24	If existing small-scale shelters, now designed for adults, also prove suitable for children, they will be given priority.
NL_163	25	COA will approach municipalities for this.
NL_163	26	Excerpt.
NL_163	27	The appeal to municipalities is the state secretary's first response to a court ruling that the Netherlands does not meet the standards for humane reception of asylum seekers.
NL_163	28	The judge ruled, among other things, that effective immediately, underage aliens may no longer be placed in crisis emergency shelters.
NL_163	29	The summary proceedings had been brought by Refugee Council.
NL_163	30	The Department of Justice and Security is studying the ruling.

NL_171	1	NU+ | Will energy companies benefit from price cap?
NL_171	2	'Books must open'
NL_171	3	The surprise was palpable when the ACM came to the House of Representatives last week to explain its oversight of energy companies' profits.
NL_171	4	"The watchdog must ensure that companies maintain no more than a ""reasonable"" profit margin, but could not say what then is reasonable."
NL_171	5	That is secret.
NL_171	6	If it becomes known how much profit is considered reasonable, all companies would start making that maximum profit, according to the ACM.
NL_171	7	So then prices go up even further.
NL_171	8	Therefore, even the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate does not know how much profit the regulator considers reasonable.
NL_171	9	"""Wow,"" responded SP MP Renske Leijten."
NL_171	10	She fears that it will become uncontrollable whether the billions of dollars in energy subsidies are going to the right places.
NL_171	11	"""The ACM is asking us to trust them on their blue eyes."
NL_171	12	"I don't,"" she tells NU.nl."
NL_171	13	Court is critical.
NL_171	14	Oversight of the regulator is now there only when energy companies go to court.
NL_171	15	Earlier this year, the Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal ruled on another case between the ACM and Essent.
NL_171	16	According to the regulator, Essent had overcharged for power in 2018.
NL_171	17	But the court strongly criticized the ACM's secret model.
NL_171	18	The regulator may only use that model to signal when companies may be overcharging.
NL_171	19	"The ACM cannot force a reduction in rates with only ""a reference to a (secret) assessment model."""
NL_171	20	Fear of high prices.
NL_171	21	Yet that model is now the government's main weapon to prevent excess profits at energy companies.
NL_171	22	On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed several motions calling on the cabinet to keep tighter tabs on suppliers.
NL_171	23	It is not yet clear whether and how supervision of energy companies will be strengthened if the price cap is implemented.
NL_171	24	From left to right, political parties fear that suppliers could use the price cap to actually increase profits.
NL_171	25	Consumers will suffer much less next year when power and gas prices are high: the government will pay anything above the ceiling price anyway.
NL_171	26	Only when usage exceeds 1,200 cubic feet of gas and 2,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity do consumers start feeling the full energy price themselves.
NL_171	27	The government will have to look closely at the books of energy companies to prevent taxpayer money from going the wrong way, says energy economist Machiel Mulder of the University of Groningen.
NL_171	28	"""We no longer have any competition."
NL_171	29	"Consumers have a guaranteed price and suppliers are reimbursed for their additional costs."""
NL_171	30	"""There is a risk that we are transferring many billions of too much tax money,"" thinks independent MP Pieter Omtzigt."
NL_171	31	"""The energy companies need to open all the books."""
NL_171	32	This is how the price cap works From January 1, maximum rates for energy will apply: 1.45 euros per cubic meter of gas (up to 1,200 cubic meters) and 40 euro cents per kilowatt hour (up to 2,900 kWh).
NL_171	33	The government transfers money to energy companies in advance.
NL_171	34	They must use that money to reimburse the difference between the market price and the ceiling price.
NL_171	35	Only afterwards is it checked whether all the money transferred has indeed reached the consumer, and whether the supplier is charging reasonable rates.
NL_171	36	The total cost of the price cap is highly uncertain, due to the highly volatile market prices for gas and electricity.
NL_171	37	The cabinet expects costs of between 10 and 40 billion euros over 2023.
NL_171	38	Expensive procurement.
NL_171	39	The price cap also removes the incentive for energy companies to buy competitively themselves.
NL_171	40	"""A company that doesn't procure properly will simply be reimbursed,"" Mulder said."
NL_171	41	The government then pays for the poor procurement strategy.
NL_171	42	Under the price cap, it will be difficult to judge companies on this, the professor believes.
NL_171	43	According to VVD MP Silvio Erkens, the cabinet should try that anyway.
NL_171	44	He wants the ministry to determine what purchasing prices are approximately reasonable.
NL_171	45	If companies have overpaid, they should pay for it themselves.
NL_171	46	"""You still have to keep an incentive so they buy in efficiently."""
NL_171	47	A spokesman for Energy Minister Rob Jetten said that work is still in progress to further develop the price cap.
NL_171	48	In doing so, the ministry is also looking at how oversight of billion-dollar payments to energy companies will work.
NL_171	49	More should become known in the coming weeks.
NL_185	1	Shaky European unanimity:
NL_185	2	Bulgaria wants to renegotiate with Russians over gas
NL_185	3	Balkan Bulgaria has made a 180-degree turn toward Russia.
NL_185	4	The government supported Ukraine and subsequent European sanctions and was subsequently cut off from Russian gas.
NL_185	5	Meanwhile, an interim government is in power that cares little for European solidarity.
NL_185	6	"The government is even seeking rapprochement with the Russians again, it was announced in a television interview this week. ""Talks are being held at the highest level,"" Prime Minister Galab Donev said."
NL_185	7	That announcement - that negotiations with Russia are underway - is causing great anxiety in capital Sofia.
NL_185	8	Hundreds of activists blocked the main entrance of the government building in recent days.
NL_185	9	They are demanding the resignation of the interim government that has been in power for less than a month.
NL_185	10	"In front of the gate of the presidential palace, civic weight BOEC used a spray can to paint an accusatory ""Z,"" the symbol of support for Russia."
NL_185	11	A message to President Rumen Radev who appointed the new government.
NL_185	12	"Leader of BOEC, Georgi Georgiev is clear: ""We demand the guarantee that Bulgaria will not reopen negotiations with Gazprom and believe that Bulgarian society has the strength to win this battle."""
NL_185	13	In capital Sofia, gas is used for communal district heating.
NL_185	14	Winters are considerably cold and in working-class neighborhoods, residents are already having high bills.
NL_185	15	At the district heating office, Bulgarians walk in and out with concerns about their payment.
NL_185	16	They have no problem with their country renegotiating with Gazprom.
NL_185	17	Pro-European Prime Minister Kiril Petkov came to power in December.
NL_185	18	He promised to end corruption and wanted independence from Russia.
NL_185	19	His government condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine and supported European sanctions.
NL_185	20	In late April, Gazprom turned off the tap to Bulgaria and Poland because of their refusal to pay in rubles.
NL_185	21	The two countries thus became the first European member states to be cut off from Russian gas.
NL_185	22	A difficult situation for Bulgaria, the country was 90 percent dependent on gas from Russia.
NL_185	23	"Prime Minister Petkov then signed an agreement with the United States for the delivery of seven liquefied natural gas (lng) tankers to ""improve Bulgaria's energy security."""
NL_185	24	An agreement in which the European Commission mediated.
NL_185	25	But the Petkov government was overthrown after a vote of no confidence.
NL_185	26	"President Radev appointed an interim government with an energy minister who quickly announced that ""it is practically inevitable that Bulgaria will negotiate with Gazprom Export for the recovery of gas resources under the current contract."""
NL_185	27	Bulgaria is one of the poorest member states of the European Union.
NL_185	28	Communist rule ended in 1989.
NL_185	29	Yet pro-Russian forces are still active in the Balkan country, a 2020 European think tank - the Center for the Study of Democracy - said.
NL_185	30	"""This U-turn is a dangerous development,"" analyzes Bulgarian Energy expert Kostantsa Rangelova."
NL_185	31	"""If Gazprom agrees to supply our gas again, it comes with significant obligations."
NL_185	32	What should we promise Gazprom that the gas will flow again?
NL_185	33	"Into what trap will we fall in the coming years?"""
NL_185	34	Bulgaria is in a serious energy crisis.
NL_185	35	The country is said to have only 54 percent of its required gas supply in order, far below the European average .
NL_185	36	The seven US tankers would deliver about 1 billion cubic meters of lng from October this year to April 2023.
NL_185	37	The interim cabinet was to confirm the agreement with the U.S. supplier in mid-August, but ultimately chose to accept only one tanker.
NL_185	38	The outgoing Prime Minister Petkov also earlier initiated the construction of an interconnector gas pipeline between Greece and Bulgaria for gas from Azerbaijan.
NL_185	39	But the interim government appeared to have taken steps blocking the connection.
NL_185	40	After protests, the interconnector looks set to go into service in October after all.
NL_185	41	The interim government has since petitioned Gazprom for new negotiations.
NL_185	42	The wait is for a response from the Russians.
NL_185	43	Several protest groups, including civic movement BOEC, have announced protracted actions.
NL_185	44	Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions are bringing many changes to the rest of Europe.
NL_185	45	So too in Cyprus.
NL_189	1	Macron, Scholz and Draghi hold out EU membership to Zelenski in Kiev
NL_189	2	Doubts.
NL_189	3	Germany and France in particular had doubts about the rush at the time of gunfire.
NL_189	4	Zelenski, who enjoys popularity in the two most powerful EU countries, exerted maximum pressure in recent weeks to rally support for his cause.
NL_189	5	Brussels is cooperating fully.
NL_189	6	A staunch supporter, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been working her bureaucratic machinery overtime to come up with an opinion on the Ukrainian application before next week's EU summit.
NL_189	7	There, member states must unanimously agree on this future perspective.
NL_189	8	Brussels is expected to issue a positive recommendation for candidacy on Friday.
NL_189	9	It is likely that, with conditions, Moldova can also count on warm support.
NL_189	10	For Georgia, the odds seem slightly less favorable.
NL_189	11	Veto.
NL_189	12	The fact that the three largest economies are already giving their blessing even before the documents appear makes it extra difficult for other doubting member states - including the Netherlands - to apply the brakes.
NL_189	13	"No one at the EU summit wants to be accused of being an ""opponent"" of Ukraine."
NL_189	14	So the chances of anyone vetoing it seem slim.
NL_189	15	Still, the speed of the discussion will depend on exactly how the European Commission writes up the opinion.
NL_189	16	Is it a conditional positive recommendation or can Ukraine get the status unconditionally?
NL_189	17	The latter would be unthinkable without the war.
NL_189	18	Moreover, the question is what the route for the next few years will be now: candidate does not automatically mean that negotiations can begin.
NL_189	19	Apart from the symbolic and geopolitical value - we do not belong to Russia - it remains to be seen what a country at war will gain from this: before Ukraine can truly join the country bloc, we are easily ten years away.
NL_189	20	In fact, Turkey has been in the waiting room since 1999.
NL_189	21	Community.
NL_189	22	"French President Macron will therefore argue at the EU summit for the creation of a new kind of ""political community"" in Europe that includes countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, as well as the United Kingdom."
NL_189	23	That club should focus only on security, energy, transportation and free movement.
NL_189	24	Earlier in the day, the four men visited Irpin, the Kiev suburb that suffered greatly at the beginning of the war.
NL_189	25	The leaders were impressed by the havoc they saw there.
NL_189	26	Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi does not want to leave devastated playgrounds and kindergartens like this.
NL_189	27	"""We will rebuild everything."""
NL_189	28	The reaction from Moscow on Thursday was mostly mocking the visit of the three EU leaders to Ukraine.
NL_189	29	"Russian former President Dmitri Medvedev hurled a childish message into the world: ""Fans of frogs, liverwurst and spaghetti like to visit Kiev."
NL_189	30	"Useless."""
NL_190	1	Energy crisis Emergency aid should bring South Africa out of the dark The South African government is intervening to ease the debts of energy company Eskom.
NL_190	2	Does that solve the years-long power crisis?
NL_190	3	South African government takes over half of energy company Eskom's debts.
NL_190	4	It involves a loan of more than 13 billion euros.
NL_190	5	With the aid, the state-owned company must pay off debts and interest obligations and pay for maintenance of coal-fired power plants.
NL_190	6	South Africa has been plagued by continuous power outages for 16 years due to mismanagement, corruption, theft and technical defects at the power plants.
NL_190	7	President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of emergency earlier this month because of power shortages, which reached a record last year.
NL_190	8	Some parts of the country are without power for up to six hours a day.
NL_190	9	Hospitals are unable to treat patients, businesses have to close and internationally, Africa's most industrialized country suffers great reputational damage.
NL_190	10	"""Our economy is at enormous risk,"" Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said in his budget speech this week."
NL_190	11	"""Uncertainty is increasing, which requires us to do bold things."""
NL_190	12	If Eskom does not meet the conditions for debt relief, heads will have to roll, he later added during an interview with Reuters.
NL_190	13	That same evening, Eskom announced that director Andre de Ruyter was stepping down effective immediately.
NL_190	14	De Ruyter had already resigned in December but would stay on until March 31 so the company could find a replacement.
NL_190	15	Possibly he has now resigned anyway because Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe accuses him of being unable to solve the crisis.
NL_190	16	He would also have completely lost the support of President Ramaphosa.
NL_190	17	Band-Aids.
NL_190	18	South Africa has wanted to reorganize the state-owned utility for years because of a constant shortage of power for its population of 60 million.
NL_190	19	But it seems to be band-aiding a system that actually needs structural reorganization.
NL_190	20	The government's loan to Eskom comes with strict conditions.
NL_190	21	For example, the money may not be used for investments in green energy.
NL_190	22	This is notable because South Africa says it wants to stop coal production by 2030.
NL_190	23	The US, UK and European Union promised South Africa $8.5 billion for the transition to renewable energy.
NL_190	24	But the crisis seems to have put the energy transition on the back burner.
NL_190	25	Critics say the government appears to be looking for a quick fix ahead of the elections.
NL_190	26	"""The risk of that is that the next crisis will be even worse,"" says sociologist Bram Büscher of Wageningen University."
NL_190	27	The professor is also affiliated with the South African universities of Johannesburg and Stellenbosch.
NL_190	28	"""The other problems, like the dirty coal mines, are not going away with this loan."""
NL_198	1	The U.S. Department of Justice will investigate the relationship between aviation manufacturer Boeing and authority Federal Aviation Administration.
NL_198	2	Prosecutors are fluffing out whether Boeing has exerted undue influence over the U.S. Aviation Authority in recent years, AP news agency reports.
NL_198	3	The Seattle Times goes even further in an analysis.
NL_198	4	Driven by budget cuts and a lack of time, aviation authority FAA is said to have given the aircraft manufacturer more and more responsibility itself.
NL_198	5	Specifically when it comes to the inspection of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft type, two of which crashed in the past six months.
NL_198	6	Hurry.
NL_198	7	It begins in 2015.
NL_198	8	Boeing is then trying to keep up with competitor Airbus and wants to get the latest aircraft, the 737 Max 8, to market as soon as possible.
NL_198	9	But the manufacturer is nine months behind its European competitor.
NL_198	10	Managers of aviation authority FAA are therefore exerting increasing influence over their safety inspectors; safety checks must be quick and the result must actually be preferably in Boeing's favor.
NL_198	11	If checks do take too long, or if safety inspectors say that some work needs to be done on the aircraft, FAA managers either rush approval through or delegate the safety checks to Boeing itself.
NL_198	12	"""There was no proper and complete review of the documents provided by Boeing."
NL_198	13	"Reviews, above all, had to meet deadlines,"" one of the inspectors told The Seattle Times."
NL_198	14	In that hasty setting, the Boeing 737 Max 8's under-fire operating system was approved in no time, inspectors interviewed said.
NL_198	15	That very operating system, called MCAS, now seems to be exhibiting glitches that may have led to the two accidents in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
NL_198	16	The exact cause of the accidents, by the way, is not yet known.
NL_198	17	"French aviation inspectors did announce last Monday that there were ""clear similarities"" between the crash of Ethiopian Airlines' Boeing 737 Max and that of Indonesia's Lion Air last October."
NL_198	18	The US aviation authority FAA also said last week it saw similarities between the two accidents involving the 737 Max 8 aircraft.
NL_198	19	Until then, the organization maintained that the Boeing aircraft was safe.
NL_198	20	FAA, unlike forty other countries around the world, did not find it necessary to ground the aircraft type.
NL_198	21	Until last Wednesday, that is.
NL_198	22	The two accidents involving the 737 Max 8 killed a total of 346 people.
NL_198	23	Also read: Boeing is no longer a success story.
NL_198	24	Aircraft maker Boeing was until recently considered primarily a success story .
NL_198	25	"The 747 was called the ""Queen of the Sky,"" the 737 a blockbuster and a gold mine."
NL_198	26	Yet with the Tenerife collision, the company also has decades of the largest plane crash ever recorded.
NL_208	1	Reportage Nursing Homes Residents with dementia stare out next to a teddy bear:
NL_208	2	'It's painful'
NL_208	3	For bear hunting, you're in the right place on Lindenburgh Avenue, centrally located in the village.
NL_208	4	Behind many of Hof van Nassau's windows is a plush toy, illustrative of this corona time.
NL_208	5	Nice for passing children, but also for the needy elderly who often sit behind the same window.
NL_208	6	If a child notices the bear, the resident can immediately wave.
NL_208	7	Every moment of contact with the outside world is one, in this time of isolation.
NL_208	8	"""It's painful,"" sighed site manager Marcha Kwisthout."
NL_208	9	Especially here at Hof van Nassau, where the often demented residents are encouraged to leave their living rooms every day.
NL_208	10	People are supposed to be outside.
NL_208	11	At the complex there is a brasserie, there is a store, a hairdresser, a physical therapist.
NL_208	12	Wherever you go, there is never a way in.
NL_208	13	But many haven't touched their coats in ages.
NL_208	14	They sit at the communal table of the living group or in their own apartment.
NL_208	15	Staring outward next to a teddy bear, for example.
NL_208	16	The candle out.
NL_208	17	A year and a half is about the average length of stay here.
NL_208	18	Then the candle is out with vulnerable residents.
NL_208	19	It raises the question of taking so much away from people in that short period of time.
NL_208	20	They are not allowed outside and visitors are out of the question.
NL_208	21	It's an ethical dilemma of sorts, Kwisthout acknowledges.
NL_208	22	"""I see what effect the measures have, both emotionally and cognitively."
NL_208	23	Dementia is a progressive disease, thanks to our Active Aging program we can still positively influence the course.
NL_208	24	Now, of necessity, that is at a standstill.
NL_208	25	In addition, there is a great need for contact between residents and family members.
NL_208	26	But I also see the other side, how sick people can get from the virus.
NL_208	27	What weighs more heavily?
NL_208	28	Out of those evils, I cannot choose.
NL_208	29	"I just assume that it is good to follow the advice of the professionals."""
NL_208	30	When the nursing homes had already been cut off from the outside world because of cabinet measures, at least here internal freedom remained intact for a while.
NL_208	31	Until the first contamination occurred and Court of Nassau had to tighten the rules.
NL_208	32	"Kwisthout: ""We work with freedoms on four levels."
NL_208	33	I estimate that eighty percent of our residents have Freedom Grade 3.
NL_208	34	They are not allowed to go into the village by themselves, but they are allowed to go all over our complex.
NL_208	35	"We had to revoke that freedom as well."""
NL_208	36	Fourteen residents have now contracted the virus.
NL_208	37	Some are emphatically on the mend, some have a considerable recovery time ahead of them.
NL_208	38	One woman died.
NL_208	39	Because Hof van Nassau consists of 15 residential groups of eight residents and most of the homes have not been affected, the virus is closer for some than others.
NL_208	40	Chatting spontaneously.
NL_208	41	The groups not in isolation can still go to the indoor garden with caregivers, according to Kwisthout.
NL_208	42	"""Only under supervision, then."
NL_208	43	But even then, the restriction of freedom does a lot.
NL_208	44	We have a resident who normally, because of her dementia, goes to the store as many as 10 times a day.
NL_208	45	She is now confronted ten times a day that it is not allowed.
NL_208	46	"That gives a lot of grief."""
NL_208	47	As lively as it should be on nice days in Hof van Nassau, life there now stands still emphatically.
NL_208	48	If you walk around the back - the little harbor of Steenbergen on one side, the nursing home on the other - you walk past the empty terrace of the brasserie.
NL_208	49	If the stories are to be believed, it should always be crowded in the spring.
NL_208	50	Just as residents also regularly stop in at Kwisthout for a spontaneous chat.
NL_208	51	That takes time, far too much sometimes, but the site manager longs for it again.
NL_208	52	After all, it's a hundred times better than a resident waving at passing children all day.

NL_213	11	In addition, ten new hospitalizations are reported.
NL_213	12	That number is well down from last week (34), though.
NL_213	13	City of Amsterdam gives hospitality industry room for larger terraces The City of Amsterdam wants to allow cafes and restaurants to temporarily expand terraces.
NL_213	14	Owners can submit a plan for this starting this week.
NL_213	15	In this way, business owners hope to be able to keep their heads above water, as the corona measures allow them to receive fewer customers.
NL_213	16	The cabinet announced earlier this month that cafes and restaurants will most likely be allowed to reopen on June 1.
NL_213	17	However, no more than thirty visitors are allowed inside at a time.
NL_213	18	In Belgium 198 new infections and 23 deaths last 24 hours In our southern neighbors, 198 new infections with the coronavirus have been counted in the last 24 hours.
NL_213	19	The downward trend in the number of infections detected thus seems to continue in Belgium as well.
NL_213	20	In the country, 23 people died from the effects of the virus in the past 24 hours.
NL_213	21	Thirty-nine newly infected persons had to be hospitalized.
NL_213	22	However, the total number of corona patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is also declining; currently, fewer than 250 COVID-19 patients are still in the ICU.
NL_213	23	European collection for vaccine raises $10 billion A global fundraising campaign to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus has so far raised more than $10 billion (more than 9.1 billion euros).
NL_213	24	This was announced by EU boss Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday.
NL_213	25	"""Great result, milestone reached,"" the European Commission president said on Twitter."
NL_213	26	The campaign launched in early May.
NL_213	27	'Dutch no less satisfied with local government in corona time' Dutch are no less satisfied with local democracy than two years ago.
NL_213	28	They are even more satisfied with how democracy works nationwide.
NL_213	29	Thus, the decisiveness with which the government is operating in the face of the corona crisis does not seem to harm, but rather to increase, satisfaction with Dutch democracy.
NL_213	30	This is according to I&O Research's research commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations on citizen perceptions of democracy during the corona crisis.
NL_213	31	Switzerland sees exports of expensive watches collapse Switzerland exported more than 81 percent fewer watches in April 2020 than in April last year, figures from the Federation of Swiss Watchmakers show.
NL_213	32	A total of just under 329 million Swiss francs (equivalent to 310 million euros) worth of watches were sold in April.
NL_213	33	The drop in exports of these luxury items, as in so many other sectors, is due to the corona crisis.
NL_213	34	Because of the virus outbreak, the production of watches was lower, they were less able to be distributed and simply sold less.
NL_215	1	Coronavirus/Covid-19 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen:
NL_215	2	"""Without vaccine, avoid contact with elderly until end of this year"""
NL_215	3	Update Sun Apr 12 16:16
NL_215	4	"""Without a vaccine, we should avoid contact with the elderly until the end of this year, especially if they live in rest homes."""
NL_215	5	So says President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in an interview with the German newspaper Bild.
NL_215	6	Virologist Marc Van Ranst is more cautious.
NL_215	7	"""We won't be able to interact between generations in a normal way, but not seeing grandparents for so long seems difficult in practice."""
NL_215	8	When will corona measures relax?
NL_215	9	And how will that affect the pandemic?
NL_215	10	When will we be able to visit our family and friends again without worry?
NL_215	11	These are questions we have often asked ourselves in recent weeks.
NL_215	12	Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, does not shy away from giving a partial answer.
NL_215	13	In an interview with Bild, von der Leyen says contact with the elderly should be avoided until at least the end of this year.
NL_215	14	Especially the elderly who reside in residential care facilities, because they are especially vulnerable.
NL_215	15	"""That is difficult and the isolation weighs heavily, but it is a matter of life and death."
NL_215	16	"We have to be patient and disciplined,"" von der Leyen said."
NL_215	17	But not everyone will have to remain in isolation for so long, according to the Commission President.
NL_215	18	Unlike seniors and people with a medical history, children and younger people will have more freedom to get around again sooner, von der Leyen believes.
NL_215	19	Virologist Marc Van Ranst doesn't want to go that far.
NL_215	20	"""It is clear that we will not deal in a normal way between different generations until there is a vaccine,"" he told VRT NWS."
NL_215	21	"""Only the timing of that vaccine is not set in stone, nor is its success as guaranteed as many believe."
NL_215	22	"So we also need to look at other exit strategies."""
NL_215	23	"""It does seem hard not seeing grandparents for so long."
NL_215	24	"That seems very difficult to put into practice,"" Van Ranst said."
NL_215	25	"""Bringing sick children to grandparents, we may never do it again."
NL_215	26	But if we all do our best now to comply with the measures, we can go for an exit strategy, which will make more possible than we have now.
NL_215	27	"Perhaps visiting grandparents with a mouth mask would be an option."""
NL_215	28	European Union guidelines and recommendations for relaxing quarantine measures in member states are also coming in the coming weeks.
NL_215	29	"A general date for such an easing is not something von der Leyen wants to impose, because the situation is different in all EU countries: ""I do not want to make general decisions, while the situation in Milan is completely different from that in Münster, and that there are great differences between urban and rural areas."""

NL_218	1	Coronacrisis
NL_218	2	Nightlife locked down, closing time in the hospitality industry and six at the table:
NL_218	3	these measures go into effect from today Update 06:19
NL_218	4	A shutdown for the hospitality industry will not occur as in previous major corona waves.
NL_218	5	But there will be a closing time: cafes and restaurants will have to close their doors at 11 p.m. starting today .
NL_218	6	The same goes for, say, drink stands at Christmas markets.
NL_218	7	We will also be allowed a maximum of 6 people at the table, unless your family has more people.
NL_218	8	Children under 12 are the exception, so they should not be counted among those 6.
NL_218	9	Previous Consultation Committees had already decided that people must show their coronapas and wear mouth masks when moving.
NL_218	10	Discotheques must close for at least three weeks starting today .
NL_218	11	For those who must close their doors, however, there will be appropriate support measures.
NL_218	12	Outdoor events can still go on though as can indoor events where the public is seated down, according to the rules already in place such as the mouth mask or coronapas.
NL_218	13	Other indoor events (that is, where the public is standing) will not be possible for at least three weeks starting Monday.
NL_218	14	So that measure - unlike the other measures - will not take effect until after the weekend.
NL_218	15	Private meetings outside the home are prohibited for the next three weeks .
NL_218	16	However, you may still receive people at home, and weddings and coffee tables at funerals will also be allowed to continue.
NL_218	17	From the moment you work with a professional caterer, you have to apply the same conditions as the catering industry.
NL_218	18	In addition, at weddings and funerals, rules regarding mouth masks, keeping your distance and use of coronapas apply.
NL_218	19	"Renting a house is still possible, but with a maximum of 15 , Minister Verlinden (CD&V) still clarified in ""The morning""."
NL_218	20	Furthermore, limited social bubbles or hugging contacts are non-existent.
NL_218	21	However, it does call for social contacts to be limited as much as possible.
NL_218	22	Decisive action is also needed within education, the Consultative Committee believes.
NL_218	23	Education ministers from the states will meet about it next weekend.
NL_218	24	A plan should be on the table by Monday.
NL_218	25	These include measures around separating groups, extracurricular activities, better detection of high-risk contacts, ventilation and mouth masks.
NL_218	26	Youth ministers, for their part, should also come up with a plan to limit or secure youth activities in indoor spaces.
NL_218	27	At last week's Consultation Committee it was decided that until December 12 we would have to work 4 days a week at home and thus 1 day at the workplace itself, after that 2 days at the office would be possible.
NL_218	28	That will now be delayed by a week.
NL_218	29	So only from Dec. 20 will it be possible to come to work at most 2 days a week itself.
NL_218	30	The booster shot vaccination campaign should be accelerated , argues the Consultative Committee.
NL_218	31	"""Vaccines are still an extremely powerful weapon."
NL_218	32	"Without vaccines, we would now be in a totally untenable situation,"" said Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD)."
NL_218	33	The various ministers of health in our country have worked out an operational plan and the intention now is to implement it as soon as possible in order to increase the vaccination campaign strongly and quickly such that as many people as possible can be vaccinated before Christmas.
NL_218	34	"There will also be ""walk-in test centers"" , where you can just walk in to get tested."
NL_218	35	Enforcement will be particularly important.
NL_218	36	Prime Minister De Croo is therefore calling on everyone to comply with the measures as best they can.
NL_218	37	Police and inspection services are asked to take strict action against violations.
NL_218	38	For those who must close, there will be appropriate support measures , De Croo said.
NL_218	39	The next Consultation Committee will take place on December 15 , at which time the measures will be evaluated.
NL_219	1	Coronacrisis Corona vaccines less effective in some patients undergoing cancer treatment Coronacrisis Corona vaccines less effective in some patients undergoing cancer treatment Patients make fewer antibodies, especially after their second shot.
NL_219	2	This is according to research conducted by the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA).
NL_219	3	10:19
NL_219	4	Some cancer treatments reduce the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine.
NL_219	5	Patients make fewer antibodies, especially after their second shot.
NL_219	6	This is according to research conducted by the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA).
NL_219	7	Side effects in patients undergoing cancer treatment were also examined.
NL_219	8	Some patients undergoing cancer treatment produce fewer antibodies when vaccinated.
NL_219	9	This is according to a study by the University Hospital Antwerp, in collaboration with Sciensano and Fight Against Cancer. 200 cancer patients were administered the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine for the study.
NL_219	10	Blood samples were taken at various times to examine the production of antibodies.
NL_219	11	Side effects were also thoroughly identified.
NL_219	12	The side effects were not too bad.
NL_219	13	"These are ""comparable to reports made by healthy individuals,"" according to department head of oncology Marc Peeters (UZA), he says in the video below."
NL_219	14	Thus, patients undergoing cancer treatment have no more (or less) side effects than people without cancer.
NL_219	15	The Pfizer vaccine is as safe for cancer patients as it is for healthy volunteers.
NL_219	16	The immune system begins producing antibodies and neutralizing antibodies after the first shot.
NL_219	17	These are capable of eliminating the virus.
NL_219	18	This is true in healthy people and also in patients undergoing cancer treatment.
NL_219	19	However, antibody production after the first shot does not increase to the same extent in all groups of patients.
NL_219	20	After the second prick, Marc Peeters says there is a clear difference between healthy people and some groups of patients undergoing cancer treatment.
NL_219	21	"""Antibodies are produced in most patients, but to a lesser extent in some treatment groups."""
NL_219	22	Patients may be less protected against the coronavirus due to this reduced production of antibodies.
NL_219	23	"Their immune response, according to the study, is ""delayed and less powerful, which can lead to breakthrough infections."""
NL_219	24	However, the reduced immune response is not there with all cancer treatments.
NL_219	25	In particular, patients receiving chemotherapy treatment produce fewer antibodies and neutralizing antibodies.
NL_219	26	"""Also, patients who were treated with the drug rituximab have a less potent immune response,"" said Marc Peeters."
NL_219	27	"""They made almost no antibodies."""
NL_219	28	Rituximab is used to treat lymphoma, among other things.
NL_219	29	It suppresses part of the immune system.
NL_219	30	Other cancer treatments seem to affect the effect of vaccination less.
NL_219	31	Thus, the immune response was quite normal in patients treated with immunotherapy and with hormonal treatments.
NL_219	32	Patients treated with chemotherapy make fewer antibodies after their second shot. fstop123.
NL_219	33	The study has practical implications.
NL_219	34	"""Cancer patients who produce fewer antibodies after their second vaccination are eligible for a third injection,"" says Marc Peeters."
NL_219	35	"""Possibly cancer patients would benefit from a third vaccine dose,"" Sciensano researcher Mieke Goossens also said."
NL_219	36	"""Further research will reveal whether they produce a greater amount of antibodies that way."""
NL_219	37	The effect of such a third prick will be studied further in the coming months.
NL_222	1	Netherlands Mediagenic disappearances & royal scoop: who is Peter R. de Vries, Holland's best-known crime journalist?
NL_222	2	18 min
NL_222	3	De Vries is following the case closely:
NL_222	4	he not only attends the trials of the kidnappers and brothers-in-law Cor van Hout and Willem Holleeder, but also stays in the same hotels where the men were placed under arrest.
NL_222	5	"De Vries is writing the book ""The Kidnapping of Alfred Heineken"" about the case, based on several interviews with Van Hout and Holleeder."
NL_222	6	They both want to talk to de Vries only on the condition that the interviews remain secret until after their trial.
NL_222	7	A promise de Vries keeps: the book will not be published until 1987.
NL_222	8	"De Vries became close friends with Van Hout over the years, to the extent that after his death in 2003 he had an obituary placed in De Telegraaf, with the telling text ""for the most extraordinary man I have met."""
NL_222	9	In 2009, it appears that de Vries helped financially reward Van Hout for his candor in the book about Heineken's kidnapping.
NL_222	10	He lets him share in the profits.
NL_222	11	Something de Vries confirms, and by his own admission, has no regrets about.
NL_222	12	"The so-called ""Putten murder case"" is a dossier into which de Vries bites like a pit bull."
NL_222	13	He devotes more than 40 broadcasts of his crime program to it.
NL_222	14	At the hands of de Vries, it will be revealed that Wilco Viets and Herman du Bois, both in jail for the rape and murder of flight attendant Christel Ambrosius, were wrongly convicted.
NL_222	15	They were released in 2002, having already served two-thirds of their 10-year sentence.
NL_222	16	They were even acquitted on appeal, which is particularly exceptional.
NL_222	17	In 2008, a new suspect is arrested.
NL_222	18	DNA testing indicates a match, sentencing the man to 18 years in prison after all.
NL_222	19	"De Vries called the moment of the arrest at the police press conference ""the best day in his career as a crime reporter."""
NL_222	20	"From 1995 to 2012, de Vries had his own program on Dutch commercial television, ""Peter R. de Vries, crime reporter"" ."
NL_222	21	In it, both new cases and so-called cold cases - that is, old unsolved crimes - are re-examined on the basis of reconstructions.
NL_222	22	And that regularly produces results.
NL_222	23	For his program, de Vries wins an International Emmy Award, one of the most prestigious television awards.
NL_222	24	He will receive that award specifically for one of the episodes about the 2006 Natalee Holloway case, the American girl who disappeared without a trace in Aruba after meeting Dutchman Joran van der Sloot.
NL_222	25	For his program, de Vries succeeds in eliciting a crucial confession about his involvement from van der Sloot through numerous conversations with a confidant, portrayed with hidden cameras and microphones in the car.
NL_222	26	Van der Sloot admits in so many words that he dumped Holloway's corpse.
NL_222	27	The case is being reopened, and is getting a lot of media attention in the US.
NL_222	28	According to the Dutch Stichting Kijkonderzoek, this broadcast featuring the confession of Joran van der Sloot was watched by 7 million people: still a record for a non-sports program on a Dutch commercial channel.
NL_222	29	And then there is the Bruinsma case, which momentarily rocked the Dutch royal house.
NL_222	30	When Dutch Prince Friso announced his engagement to Mabel Wisse Smit in 2003, it became known that she had a past relationship with drug lord Klaas Bruinsma.
NL_222	31	Wisse Smit does not deny that she had contact with him, but rather that it was a love affair.
NL_222	32	She allegedly cut off all contact when she found out what business Bruinsma was involved in.
NL_222	33	Also, Prince Friso would have been aware of his future wife's past from the beginning of their relationship.
NL_222	34	But Peter R. de Vries is airing an interview with Charlie da Silva, a former bodyguard of Bruinsma.
NL_222	35	This sheds new light on the case, because da Silva that Wisse Smit was indeed the great love of Bruinsma.
NL_222	36	Even before the broadcast, Wisse Smit sent out a statement denying it.
NL_222	37	More details about the affair of the future Dutch princess and the drug lord will follow in a second televised episode.
NL_222	38	By the way, in the early 1990s de Vries and Bruinsma were regularly spotted together: so both men know each other as well.
NL_222	39	The case is causing a stir in the Netherlands, although Queen Beatrix continues to support her future daughter-in-law.
NL_222	40	However, no consent bill is filed for the marriage, which means so much that Prince Friso will lose his right as heir to the throne when he marries Mabel Wisse Smit in April 2004.
NL_222	41	And so it came to pass: Prince Friso prefers love to the throne.
NL_226	1	Africa Experts Chamber committee Belgian colonial past:
NL_226	2	"""Belgium must assume its historical responsibility"""
NL_226	3	19:18
NL_226	4	In the special House committee looking into our colonial past, also known as the Congressional Committee, the experts presented their preliminary report.
NL_226	5	They offered tools to acknowledge and process the past, together with Congolese, Rwandans and Burundians in Belgium and at home.
NL_226	6	For some a process of years, others do not want an endless debate.
NL_226	7	There is little appetite for reparations.
NL_226	8	Committee Chairman Wouter De Vriendt of Green had to watch the session from home due to corona.
NL_226	9	"""Everything passes, except the past."""
NL_226	10	"The sentence that now also adorns the wall of the renovated AfricaMuseum is by Professor Emeritus Luc Huyse, and is about the ""phantom pain"" that people of later generations still experience for injustices done to their ancestors."
NL_226	11	Jurist Martien Schotsmans of the expert committee cited the phrase to formulate her recommendations on how Belgium can compensate the victims of colonial rule and heal the wounds.
NL_226	12	That the Belgian colonial system committed serious misdeeds, experts agree.
NL_226	13	Both under the reign of King Leopold II and during the era of Belgian Congo and after the independence of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi - then Rwanda-Urundi - the colonized peoples were physically, economically and psychologically exploited, historians and other experts say.
NL_226	14	For them, it is high time Belgium took its historical responsibility for this.
NL_226	15	The expert committee gave a number of recommendations for MPs to work on now with their report.
NL_226	16	That their work of nearly 700 pages has gaps due to lack of time, they themselves admit.
NL_226	17	"""For example, the situation in Rwanda and Burundi has not been adequately explained, nor has the important role of the Catholic Church been examined,"" said historian Sara Van Beurden."
NL_226	18	The committee requests additional time to work on this.
NL_226	19	The experts' recommendations include recovery for affected populations and individuals.
NL_226	20	"""That cannot be reduced to mere financial compensation, apologies or the return of art objects,"" legal expert Martien Schotsmans said in nuance."
NL_226	21	"""It should be a comprehensive recovery program in consultation with everyone."
NL_226	22	"""The basis is that truth is recognized."
NL_226	23	"This is followed by talking to the target groups, such as in hearings or through questioning, and the final goal is so-called ""outreach"": a social debate about colonialism and its consequences, such as racism."
NL_226	24	"Only then will you create a support base to work on long-term recovery."""
NL_226	25	But like the experts themselves, opinions vary within the House committee.
NL_226	26	The recommendation of certain experts, for example, to allow regularization of sans-papiers from the countries concerned, or to engage in positive discrimination, was criticized.
NL_226	27	"Several MPs also commented on the ""fragmented"" and ""incoherent"" nature of the report and the lack of consensus among the experts."
NL_226	28	But the financial damages advocated by art historian Anne Wetsi Mpoma are particularly controversial.
NL_226	29	Vooruit and CD&V are taking a wait-and-see approach; Vlaams Belang, N-VA and Open VLD think it's a bridge too far.
NL_226	30	Today's Belgians are not to blame.
NL_226	31	We cannot ask today's Belgians to pay for a past they did not choose to have
NL_226	32	The experts want the work of the special House committee to be an inclusive and transparent process that should ultimately build support for reconciliation.
NL_226	33	"CD&V MP Els Van Hoof calls this report ""one of the cornerstones to move forward on and hear many more voices and look at other angles."""
NL_226	34	Goedele Liekens of Open VLD does not want it to become an endless process that leads to nothing.

NL_244	5	Verstappen finished third in the first practice session with a time of 1.45.507.
NL_244	6	He improved to 1.45.394 in the second practice session, finishing sixth.
NL_244	7	Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc dominated the top of the timesheets.
NL_244	8	"""I don't think we can beat Ferrari, but we can get closer."
NL_244	9	Above all, we try to be close to Mercedes.
NL_244	10	"We'll see how that works out,"" Verstappen looked ahead to qualifying."
NL_244	11	"""In any case, this track suits Ferrari better than ours because they gain a lot of time on the straights."
NL_244	12	"That in itself is no surprise either."""
NL_244	13	Older engine, so not at full power.
NL_244	14	Verstappen's times could still go down on Saturday, as Red Bull used an older engine from the pool of three power units in its car for Friday.
NL_244	15	As a result, power output was lower than normal.
NL_244	16	"""You do notice that in the lap time on a seven-kilometer circuit,"" Verstappen explained."
NL_244	17	"""It was a precautionary measure, tomorrow the engine will be able to run again at the normal positions, because there will be another one in it."""
NL_244	18	Worries about the engine are not there.
NL_244	19	Verstappen now has three engines in use this season, which is actually the limit.
NL_244	20	From the next race in Italy, Honda's spec 4 will almost certainly come into the Red Bull and a grid penalty will follow.
NL_244	21	At Spa, he will have to make do with the older version for a while.
NL_244	22	Max Verstappen in action during the second free practice for the Belgian Grand Prix.Red Bull competitive in second sector.
NL_244	23	Verstappens Red Bull does still excel in cornering.
NL_244	24	"""Yes, I am generally satisfied with how the car behaves."
NL_244	25	"We are very competitive in the second sector and I am happy with the balance."""
NL_244	26	The seven-time GP winner is resigned to the big advantage in top speed that the Ferraris have on in the full-throttle sections.
NL_244	27	"""We can't do much more to really get faster on the straights because everyone is already driving with very little downforce."
NL_244	28	"Yes, we can take the rear wing off,"" he concluded jokingly."
NL_244	29	"""But I don't think that's a good idea."""
NL_244	30	Saturday is third free practice at noon, followed by qualifying at 3 p.m.
NL_244	31	The Belgian Grand Prix will start at 3:10 p.m. on Sunday.
NL_244	32	Verstappen is currently third in the World Cup standings, with 181 points, behind Hamilton (250 points) and Bottas (188 points).
NL_244	33	The Belgian Grand Prix is the first of nine remaining races in the second half of the season.
NL_252	1	Dutch in US over cold: stoking for a month and tape on doors 22:07 in Foreign Due to severe cold and punishing winds sweeping across the United States, tens of millions of Americans are facing weather warnings.
NL_252	2	"Don't hit the road, avoid outdoor activities and protect people, pets, pipes and plants - the U.S. Weather Service refers to it as ""the four p's"": people pets pipes and plants ."
NL_252	3	Many tens of millions of Americans are currently facing advisories like this as severe cold and punishing winds sweep across the United States.
NL_252	4	Warnings have been issued in more than half the country for extremely low temperatures, among other things.
NL_252	5	According to the weather service, it is not often that so many warnings are in effect at the same time.
NL_252	6	"Special ""warming shelters"" have been set up in several places around the country for homeless people."
NL_252	7	More than 1.4 million Americans are without power, especially in the eastern states.
NL_252	8	Thousands of flights and dozens of train trips have also been canceled due to the winter weather, throwing millions of people's Christmas schedules into disarray.
NL_252	9	"""Christmas is canceled,"" a New York State resident tells CNN ."
NL_252	10	"""All my family and friends agreed that that was safer."""
NL_252	11	We spoke to three Dutch people living in the U.S. about their experiences in the cold.
NL_252	12	They agree that the current cold is not unique, but does have one thing that makes the feeling extra intense: icy wind.
NL_252	13	Blizzard warnings are being issued in some areas of Illinois.
NL_252	14	But in Adair, the hamlet where Dutchman Barend Wurth has lived for five years, the snow is not too bad.
NL_252	15	"""It is especially very cold,"" he says of the temperature of -22 degrees, which feels like about -38."
NL_252	16	"""I live in an old farmhouse and really have to make sure all the doors are closed."
NL_252	17	"Before that, I even sealed the outside doors with tape."""
NL_252	18	But the tape doesn't keep out all the cold.
NL_252	19	"""On the tape now there is a layer of ice."
NL_252	20	I have a hat on in the house and am pretty stoked.
NL_252	21	Yesterday, today and tomorrow morning, I am expected to consume a monthly amount.
NL_252	22	"That's a problem for many people here, because of the high energy prices."""
NL_252	23	Wurth only taped the doors on the northwest side of his home, where the wind comes from.
NL_252	24	Because it is mostly the wind that makes it cold, he says.
NL_252	25	"""In 2019, it was also incredibly cold here, but then there was less wind."
NL_252	26	When you go outside now, the first breath just hurts.
NL_252	27	"The wind makes it unbearable and dangerous."""
NL_252	28	Erna Moraine also says it: the wind makes the big difference.
NL_252	29	Dutch has experienced several (very) cold spells in the 40 years she has lived in the United States.
NL_252	30	"""And certainly winters with days like this, with lots of snow, wind and cold."
NL_252	31	But as extreme as now, with that wind chill of -38 degrees, that is life-threatening.
NL_252	32	You can't expose your bare skin to that, including your face.
NL_252	33	"And I think that makes it different now."""
NL_252	34	A walk outside is not justified with the current weather conditions, Moraine said.
NL_252	35	"""So we just walked around the mall,"" she says."
NL_252	36	"""But many stores do now have notices hanging on the door that they are closed or closing early because of the weather."""
NL_252	37	Frank van den Berge, who has lived in the United States since 1988, also sees the positive aspects of winter weather.
NL_252	38	"""The snow blows across the roads here, you can hear the wind through the windows."
NL_252	39	"It does give a kind of Christmas atmosphere."""
NL_252	40	The Dutch American is used to cold, though.
NL_252	41	"""It's often cold here in Wisconsin in the winter and there's often snow, actually always."
NL_252	42	"If the wind had not been there, it would not have been so abnormal and obstructive."""
NL_252	43	At Van den Berge in Brookfield, it is currently about -23 degrees.
NL_252	44	"""You dress on it, with a warm coat, hat or balaclava, where only your eyes and mouth are visible."""
NL_252	45	Like Barend Wurth, Van den Berge has his doors taped shut.
NL_252	46	"""But I put that tape over the cracks every winter, against drafts."
NL_252	47	"As a Dutchman, you remain frugal anyway."""
NL_260	1	Air attack Hawija Who knew what and at what time?
NL_260	2	The question arose in the House of Representatives as to whether the granting of the Iraq mission played a role in the concealment of information.
NL_260	3	"How is it that in 2015 no one - Prime Minister Mark Rutte first and foremost - was alarmed by the Dutch bombing of Iraqi Hawija, where it was clear from the outset that there would have been more damage, and ""probably"" civilian casualties?"
NL_260	4	That question was asked, in many guises, on Wednesday evening by all parties as well as government parties D66 and ChristenUnie to Prime Minister Rutte (VVD) and Minister Ank Bijleveld (Defense, CDA).
NL_260	5	In the first part of the debate about the civilian casualties that occurred in Hawija and about who knew what about them and at what time, the House of Representatives focused mainly on Rutte.
NL_260	6	"But the ""culture of silence"" at the Ministry of Defense was also discussed (PvdA), Prime Minister Rutte's ""selective dementia"" (Denk) and the question of whether ""this cabinet wants to know the truth"" (SP)."
NL_260	7	D66 asked the minister to still investigate the exact number of civilian deaths that occurred in 2015.
NL_260	8	GroenLinks came up with new facts: because on June 19, 2015, ten days after then Defense Minister Jeanine Hennis (VVD) was briefed on the damage caused by the Dutch bombing, the then-Rutte II cabinet sent a letter to the House of Representatives, announcing the extension of the Dutch contribution to the anti-IS coalition in Iraq.
NL_260	9	"""Was extending the mission more important than sharing the truth?"""
NL_260	10	, asked Jesse Klaver.
NL_260	11	Because that knowledge, which was not mentioned in the overview Bijleveld sent to the House of Representatives earlier, shines new light on the context of the time: that extension letter shows that the Council of Ministers in June 2015 discussed with certainty the Dutch contribution in Iraq.
NL_260	12	Did the civilian deaths come up there?
NL_260	13	No, Rutte said stellar, as he began to answer the House.
NL_260	14	The prime minister denied that information was deliberately withheld from the House with the aim of extending the mission in Iraq.
NL_260	15	Even after Joël Voordewind of coalition party ChristenUnie said so.
NL_260	16	"""There is no cover-up."""
NL_260	17	"Rutte went on to say, ""I can't fake memories I don't have."""
NL_260	18	Shortly thereafter, NRC went to print.
NL_260	19	The stakes were clearly higher, in this debate.
NL_260	20	The plenary chamber of the House of Representatives was fuller: there were more MPs present, more photographers, more audience.
NL_260	21	"Ank Bijleveld had thought carefully: three weeks ago she was still wearing a bright blouse during the first debate on Hawija, on Wednesday night she sat in black in ""box K."
NL_260	22	The Labour Party was also criticized.
NL_260	23	Because ministers from that party (Bert Koenders, then Foreign Affairs Minister, and Lilianne Ploumen, then Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation) also signed with Hennis on June 23, 2015, the letter containing incorrect information to the House.
NL_260	24	"""You have a hundred pounds of butter on your head,"" Geert Wilders (PVV) reproached the Labour Party."
NL_260	25	It was this same Wilders who did most of the opposition, for the first few hours.
NL_260	26	As the only group chairman, he interrupted the governing parties during their contribution with questions about the stability of the coalition and pointed out delicately the mutual discord between governing parties VVD, CDA, D66 and ChristenUnie.
NL_260	27	"As on ChristenUnie frontman Gert-Jan Segers, who told NU.nl about Rutte forgetting information about civilian casualties, ""I do think I would have remembered."""
NL_260	28	"Bijleveld, according to Wilders, would have ""with twinkling eyes"" involved Rutte in the issue."
NL_260	29	"D66 MP Salima Belhaj bitched that her party was committing ""bread theft."""
NL_260	30	"""You make us redundant as an opposition."""
NL_260	31	"""This is about war,"" Belhaj responded."
NL_260	32	"""I'm trying to deal with this seriously, I want to find out what happened."""
NL_260	33	This debate will only be the beginning of that.
NL_264	1	Terrorism funding Chairman charity foundation suspected of IS funding The World Wide Relief foundation held benefit events for victims of the Syrian civil war.
NL_264	2	In reality, according to the prosecution, they funneled the donations to IS.
NL_264	3	A major terrorism financing investigation for which the Justice Department arrested six men in November revolves around the Hilversum-based charity World Wide Relief.
NL_264	4	In addition to the foreman of that foundation, Muslim preacher Fouad el B. , it now appears that chairman Mohamed el A. has also been arrested in the case.
NL_264	5	This was confirmed by his lawyer Jan Boone.
NL_264	6	The prosecution had so far only announced that six men had been arrested in the Netherlands and Belgium, without specifying who they were or which foundation they were affiliated with.
NL_264	7	World Wide Relief held benefit events at mosques for victims of the Syrian civil war between 2013 and 2015.
NL_264	8	In reality, according to the prosecution, they funneled the donations to terror movement IS.
NL_264	9	A sum of two tons was allegedly withdrawn in cash and taken to fighters in Syria.
NL_264	10	The suspects were released after questioning by the prosecution pending the progress of the investigation.
NL_264	11	According to attorney Boone, this indicates that the case has little merit.
NL_264	12	"""If you release someone two days after his arrest, you obviously don't have a reasonable suspicion of guilt."
NL_264	13	"They just can't make the case hard."""
NL_264	14	"The prosecution, however, informs that the investigation is still ""ongoing"" and that a final case report is awaited."
NL_264	15	The suspects may await the course of the investigation at liberty for the time being.
NL_264	16	"""We always weigh whether it is necessary for the investigation that suspects be detained,"" a spokesman said."
NL_264	17	Longstanding question marks.
NL_264	18	Chairman Mohamed El A. denies all allegations, says attorney Boone.
NL_264	19	"""My client arranged for blankets and mattresses to head toward the border to Syria."
NL_264	20	Whether those blankets were for IS, I don't know.
NL_264	21	But even that would not be punishable.
NL_264	22	"The foundation gave those blankets because they saw that people in Syria were in the terrible cold."""
NL_264	23	However, he invoked his right to remain silent in police questioning.
NL_264	24	"Boone: ""Justice just has to prove otherwise."
NL_264	25	"He doesn't have to declare against himself, does he?"""
NL_264	26	There had long been question marks about World Wide Relief's actions.
NL_264	27	For example, the Facebook pages of IS sympathizers called for people to donate money to the foundation.
NL_264	28	Boone says he knows nothing about that.
NL_264	29	"""If so, that does seem to me to be a reason for the government to look at what this foundation is doing."
NL_264	30	"But not this way: with arrests without anything concrete in hand."""

NL_265	2	All rights reserved Protest against racism and police brutality US President Donald Trump signs executive order on police reform, will it make a difference?
NL_265	3	Tue Jun 16 20:53
NL_265	4	The wave of protests following the death of George Floyd in the United States demanded a thorough reform of the police in the United States.
NL_265	5	President Donald Trump has now proposed new measures for the first time and signed an executive order on the matter.
NL_265	6	Thus, the controversial chokehold would no longer be allowed.
NL_265	7	But observers believe this decree will change very little in practice.
NL_265	8	Since the death of black American George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis, USA, protests have erupted to denounce racism and police brutality.
NL_265	9	US President Donald Trump has now signed an executive order seeking limited law enforcement reform.
NL_265	10	In this way, Trump wants to capitalize on the ongoing wave of protests.
NL_265	11	"Striking: the controversial chokehold or neck clamp ( chokehold is the term Trump used) that took the life of George Floyd in Minneapolis would now only be allowed ""when an officer's life is in danger."""
NL_265	12	"The US president also called on law enforcement agencies to adopt ""the strictest professional standards."""
NL_265	13	"At the same time, President Trump reiterated the importance of what he calls ""law and order,"" to quickly restore order to his country."
NL_265	14	"""Americans want and demand that,"" it sounded."
NL_265	15	"""Some don't even know they want it, yet they want it."
NL_265	16	The numerous demonstrations in the United States also drew attention to underlying racism among police departments.
NL_265	17	The decree says nothing about that.
NL_265	18	Nor did the president broach the subject of racism during the ceremony.
NL_265	19	He did express his condolences to the families of victims.
NL_265	20	The president also said in his speech in the Rose Garden - that's the garden near the Oval Office in the White House in Washington that the vast majority of agents do their jobs flawlessly.
NL_265	21	"""They are in great danger of helping people they have never met,"" the president said."
NL_265	22	Trump does want reforms in police training.
NL_265	23	And there will be a registry, keeping track of the names of agents who go over the line.
NL_265	24	Yet the decree will not immediately change much in practice.
NL_265	25	The decree describes the major principles to be pursued.
NL_265	26	Many police departments in the United States are organized locally, by city and state.
NL_265	27	These follow their own rules; the presidential decree can only outline a framework.
NL_265	28	The Black Lives Matter protest movement will no doubt also not see in this decree the great leap forward that protesters have been demanding for weeks.
NL_276	1	"Flemish companies export parts for this A400M Middle East Flemish government in court for ""arms exports to Turkey"" 56 min"
NL_276	2	The Flemish government says these are parts that are also used in civilian Airbus aircraft.
NL_276	3	Even according to Europe, that is not considered arms exports.
NL_276	4	A writ of summons against the Flemish government is being filed today in the court of first instance by Peace Action with the support of Amnesty International Belgium.
NL_276	5	The organizations want the Flemish government to stop exporting parts for Turkish military aircraft.
NL_276	6	Specifically, these are parts such as nuts and bolts and wing parts.
NL_276	7	"Not everything supplied to a foreign military is simply labeled ""arms export."""
NL_276	8	"""Take a Flemish company that would make ballpoint pens."
NL_276	9	Suppose that were to receive an order from a foreign military, would those ballpoint pens fall under arms export?
NL_276	10	"Of course not,"" said one person involved in the case."
NL_276	11	"""We do, of course, consider weapons, or parts of weapons, to be 'arms exports,'"" he said."
NL_276	12	Already since 2013, Belgian arms companies Asco Industries, Sonaca and Safran Aero Boosters have been supplying parts of the engine, wings and landing gear of the Turkish A400M military transport aircraft.
NL_276	13	That plane plays a role in supplying weapons and mercenaries for armed conflicts in Libya and Azerbaijan.
NL_276	14	Those supplies violate international arms embargoes on those countries.
NL_276	15	The question, of course, is what that has to do with Flemish exports of parts to Franco-German aircraft maker Airbus.
NL_276	16	The parts made by Flemish companies are not always specifically designed for military use.
NL_276	17	They are often part of the wings of almost all of Airbus' civilian aircraft, so we don't know if the specific nuts or bolts will end up in which aircraft.
NL_276	18	Moreover, the specific device, the A400M, is also being delivered to quite a few European countries, including Belgium itself.
NL_276	19	Our country co-developed the military transport aircraft, and therefore may also co-supply parts for the aircraft.
NL_276	20	According to Flemish and European regulations, the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels companies produce non-essential parts (of components) of the A400M.
NL_276	21	So these are parts (of parts) that can also be found in civilian aircraft in slightly modified form, including the slabs and wing parts.
NL_276	22	Shouldn't those companies know who the end customer is for their parts?
NL_276	23	""" European Directive 2009/43 explicitly prohibits restrictions on intra-European trade of non-essential components."
NL_276	24	"Thus, the reporting requirement cited by Peace Action and Amnesty does not apply in this case either."" says a Flemish official close to the case."
NL_276	25	"""Flanders has actually been one of the toughest students in Europe's 'arms export class' for some time now"" says the person involved."
NL_276	26	"""Although of course that is not so difficult for us, Flanders actually has little or no real arms industry."
NL_276	27	"In Wallonia, of course, with companies like FN and John Cockerill, it is different."""
NL_276	28	"Jan Jambon, as authorized Prime Minister, already received a packet of questions on the matter: ""I stand by my intention to refuse, until further notice, all applications for the export of defense-related products to Turkey, as well as applications for shipments with established end-use in Turkey, obviously within the contours of the Arms Trade Decree and applicable European Regulations."""
NL_276	29	"But for the parts of the A400M, he does have a different consideration: ""The parts supplied by Flemish companies are not piecework for the Turkish Air Force or any user of the A400M aircraft."
NL_276	30	"It is about non-essential parts that are produced in bulk and delivered to another supplier for integration into another part; so there is also no delivery to the system integrator."""
NL_276	31	"Says Jambon."""
NL_276	32	"""That is a fundamental difference from deliveries of finished systems to an operational user or of main components to a system integrator, in which we could effectively apply the restrictions you are asking for."" he said."

NL_291	10	At Sint-Jozef College in Aarschot, principal Mattias Paglialunga tries to concentrate sanitary traffic as much as possible during the break.
NL_291	11	'We don't have pee passes, but during classes almost all the restroom doors close.'
NL_291	12	Almost everywhere, the same reasoning rings true.
NL_291	13	Structured potty breaks help maintain order in school.
NL_291	14	'You know how that goes,' says Reyskens.
NL_291	15	'As soon as someone wants to go to the bathroom, suddenly the whole class has to.'
NL_291	16	According to Van Keerbergen, it is mainly a matter of keeping an overview.
NL_291	17	'Because the teacher's name is on our passes, we know right away who the frequent urinators are and if there is a lesson pattern in toilet visits.
NL_291	18	Besides, you just don't have control anymore when students can walk in and out freely.
NL_291	19	Over the past two years, Verhenne has watched the lack of control turn into increasing vandalism.
NL_291	20	'It used to be less pronounced, but these days the boys' toilets in particular look rather unbecoming.'
NL_291	21	The relatively limited damage also creates logistical problems, Verhenne said.
NL_291	22	'Fortunately, it sticks to mischief like chocolate on the toilet doors, or scattering unwound rolls of toilet paper around.
NL_291	23	We have no manpower to guard the toilets, so to prevent it from escalating we lock doors during classes.
NL_291	24	Confidence.
NL_291	25	What if the need is really high?
NL_291	26	All of our respondents indicated that there is never an absolute ban.
NL_291	27	"""Nor is that desirable,"" believes Dimitri Meurrens of the Institute Maris Stella - Sint Agnes in Borgerhout."
NL_291	28	'You can't stop that anyway.
NL_291	29	Yes, it's annoying when a teacher has to interrupt his lesson repeatedly, but a student with a full bladder can't concentrate anyway.
NL_291	30	How do you distinguish the balorigen from the needy?
NL_291	31	Verhenne: I assume my teachers know their students.
NL_291	32	So what if they make an error in judgment?
NL_291	33	Missing is human.
NL_291	34	Paglialunga advocates dialogue.
NL_291	35	'We prefer a conversation when things do go wrong.
NL_291	36	You want to understand why a student is trying to escape classes.
NL_291	37	Meurrens is of the same opinion.
NL_291	38	'It comes down to asking questions.
NL_291	39	Does a student feel bad?
NL_291	40	Does he not like going to school?
NL_291	41	Is there something else going on?
NL_291	42	At the end of the day, it's a matter of trust.
NL_293	1	Caught red-handed with a bag full of currency bills:
NL_293	2	scandal among socialists in European Parliament
NL_293	3	MEPs are gathering in Strasbourg today as scheduled.
NL_293	4	Yet for once, political current events will not be at the top of the agenda.
NL_293	5	The parliament's Social Democratic group is embroiled in an unseen scandal.
NL_293	6	On Friday, the Greek vice president, Eva Kaili, was arrested in our country.
NL_293	7	Normally she enjoys parliamentary immunity, but she was caught red-handed with a bag full of currency bills, which allowed her to be arrested anyway.
NL_293	8	Along with three others, she is charged with membership in a criminal organization, money laundering and corruption.
NL_293	9	She allegedly received bribes from Qatar, which is currently hosting the World Cup, for influencing decisions in parliament and promoting a positive image of Qatar.
NL_293	10	Among her colleagues, the reaction is outraged.
NL_293	11	"""This is terrible and dramatic for the reputation of the parliament,"" said Kathleen Van Brempt, MEP for Forward and group colleague of Kaili."
NL_293	12	She has also been wide-eyed at the images of Kaili now circulating, in which the Greek praises human rights in Qatar.
NL_293	13	"""With hindsight, of course, it's easy to talk."
NL_293	14	But Kaili is actually not at all concerned with human rights in parliament.
NL_293	15	"So you could ask yourself why she suddenly came up with Qatar,"" Van Brempt said."
NL_293	16	Kaili, meanwhile, was expelled from her group and suspended as vice president.
NL_293	17	Belgium is also involved.
NL_293	18	But the scandal is not limited to Kaili alone.
NL_293	19	F.G., parliamentary assistant for the Social Democrats and partner of Kaili, was also arrested.
NL_293	20	That assistant worked in the past for former Italian MEP Antonio Panzeri.
NL_293	21	In turn, 600,000 euros in cash was found in his house.
NL_293	22	According to Italian media, his wife and daughter were also arrested in Italy following a European arrest warrant.
NL_293	23	Panzeri would be seen by investigators as a pivotal figure.
NL_293	24	The scandal also has a Belgian offshoot.
NL_293	25	On Friday, the office of a Marie Arena employee was sealed.
NL_293	26	She sits in the European Parliament for the PS and was even Prime Minister of the French Community in the past.
NL_293	27	The office of an associate of Marc Tarabella (PS) was also sealed.
NL_293	28	But on Saturday night, investigators also raided Tarabella's own home.
NL_293	29	European Parliament President Roberta Metsola flew back to Belgium from Malta especially for this purpose.
NL_293	30	From Tarabella's home in Liège, investigators took his cell phone and a laptop.
NL_293	31	"""I have absolutely nothing to hide and I will answer any questions from the investigators if that can help them shed light on this case,"" the MP revealed."
NL_300	1	Cashless
NL_300	2	Nearly 90 percent of Belgians prefer to pay digitally.
NL_300	3	Even so, 63 percent of purchases in retail stores in our country are still paid with cash, a survey by the banking federation Febelfin reveals.
NL_300	4	So there is strong consumer demand for cashless payments, but supply is not following.
NL_300	5	In a lot of larger commercial establishments - clothing boutiques, shoe stores, restaurants, gas stations - paying by card is commonplace, especially if they are chains.
NL_300	6	But quite a few (retail) merchants - think butchers, bakers, sandwich stores, French fry stores, who usually deal with smaller amounts - only accept cash.
NL_300	7	They don't install a payment terminal and screen on the grounds that it's too heavy an investment and that they would have to remit a percent per transaction, which further erodes their limited profit margin.
NL_300	8	That argument is becoming less and less valid.
NL_300	9	The cost to merchants of electronic payments has fallen.
NL_300	10	And they forget that cash payments also have fees associated with them, although sometimes they remain hidden.
NL_300	11	Another advantage is that electronic money cannot just disappear from the till - admittedly some will see that as a disadvantage - and it facilitates financial administration.
NL_300	12	No doubt a number of merchants also stick to cash payments because it allows them to keep their income, or part of it, out of sight of the taxman.
NL_300	13	But that is not a valid argument.
NL_300	14	Technological developments have greatly increased the ease of use of electronic payments in recent years.
NL_300	15	It is no longer the cause of exasperating traffic jams at store checkouts.
NL_300	16	Thanks to applications such as contactless payment by bank card or smartphone, this is faster than cash payments.
NL_300	17	Banks have also developed apps to make digital payments easier, for consumers and merchants.
NL_300	18	How archaic is it when shoppers first pass by an ATM to take money out of the wall, then use those bills to pay for their purchases in a store, and the merchant later has to go back to the bank with those bills to have them added to his account?
NL_300	19	It makes sense that banks still have little appetite to continue investing to maintain the outdated technology of bill vending machines.
NL_300	20	The banks are perfectly justified in pushing their customers and merchants more strongly toward digital payments and discouraging the use of cash.
NL_300	21	By reducing the number of bill machines.
NL_300	22	Or by charging fees for those who withdraw cash, even from their own account.
NL_300	23	The consumer organization Test-Achats is fighting the wrong battle by attacking the banks that do so.
NL_300	24	It is equally incomprehensible that some banks are going through the motions for this, such as Bank of the Post recently.
NL_300	25	Cashless payment is a form of progress.
NL_300	26	It is the future, it should be encouraged.
NL_300	27	Cease the rearguard action.
NL_M_002	1	"If we can remove one word from the dictionary it is the word ""graduate."
NL_M_002	2	In a world that is changing at lightning speed and increasingly revolves around knowledge and information, we learn every day.
NL_M_002	3	We do this in schools and universities, but equally at home, in the digital world and at work.
NL_M_002	4	Learning we do from the first day of our lives, in order to understand the world around us and cope with change and difference.
NL_M_002	5	Knowledge, craftsmanship and skills are the basis for participating in society and making full use of your own talents.
NL_M_002	6	Good teaching begins with a great respect for the profession and authority of the teacher.
NL_M_002	7	It also requires that we remove barriers to learning and continued learning and give scholars and students time and space to find their own path.
NL_M_002	8	Not the government, but parents themselves choose the type of education for their children.
NL_M_002	9	We protect the space for special schools to design their own education based on religion, belief or pedagogical vision.
NL_M_002	10	Every Dutchman can count on that.
NL_M_002	11	We are concerned about the quality of education.
NL_M_002	12	This needs to go up.
NL_M_002	13	Teachers now have to spend unnecessary time on administration, time they could be spending on their students.
NL_M_002	14	Declining reading proficiency is also a major concern and this is one of the biggest tasks to improve in the coming years.
NL_M_002	15	We are raising the bar and strengthening the quality of education, especially on core skills such as reading, writing and math.
NL_M_002	16	To give young people every opportunity to learn and develop, we stand for an education system in which young people are encouraged to continue learning.
NL_M_002	17	For those who are able and willing, moving on from MBO to HBO and on to university should always be an option.
NL_M_002	18	In the labor market, learning and working is a natural combination for more and more occupations.
NL_M_002	19	In very many professions and jobs, we continue to learn to ensure that we always have the knowledge, craftsmanship and skills needed.
NL_M_002	20	Science is the guide into a world we do not yet know.
NL_M_002	21	Our universities and research institutes are among the world's best, and we owe this position in part to the intensive cooperation between education, business and government.
NL_M_011	1	We want people to be able to control their energy bills by encouraging clean energy generation close to home.
NL_M_011	2	No roof remains unused for solar panels.
NL_M_011	3	Generating your own solar energy at home will not yet cover the total energy demand.
NL_M_011	4	Therefore, we give space to the development of all forms of clean energy.
NL_M_011	5	New large-scale onshore solar and wind projects are still important to meet sustainability goals.
NL_M_011	6	It is important to speed up wind farm construction procedures and make them less complex.
NL_M_011	7	The demand for clean energy is too important to prevent with strict regulations.
NL_M_011	8	The solar and wind energy industries are expected to involve local residents in the arrival of solar and wind farms and to take nature into account when developing solar and wind farms.
NL_M_011	9	We want people to have as much opportunity as possible to generate their own clean energy.
NL_M_011	10	We see a role for energy collectives and neighborhood windmills.
NL_M_011	11	We also encourage energy cooperatives that realize local large-scale renewable energy generation.
NL_M_011	12	Participation and co-benefit of residents is key.
NL_M_011	13	For example, provinces, municipalities and the state should also be able to require that people living near a wind turbine share in the profits.
NL_M_011	14	The climate agreement has already agreed that we aim for at least 50 percent local ownership for renewable generation on land.
NL_M_011	15	We are going to further solidify that commitment with additional funding and binding agreements.
NL_M_011	16	For example, local residents can participate in a local energy cooperative and share in the proceeds of a wind farm.
NL_M_011	17	Other ways of financial participation are also possible, such as wind farm funds, bonds and resident schemes.
NL_M_011	18	We expect housing associations to make their roofs more sustainable with solar panels and, where possible, to green them by installing a green roof.
NL_M_011	19	Within the agreements of the solar ladder, we provide space for large solar fields.
NL_M_011	20	In addition, we encourage the development of large wind farms.
NL_M_011	21	By placing them together in a number of locations around the country, we limit nuisance and protect views of the Dutch landscape.
NL_M_011	22	We encourage space saving by putting solar panels on roofs and facades.
NL_M_011	23	In the Environment Act, more flexibility is needed to apply this.
NL_M_011	24	The installation of solar panels in new construction and renovations will be mandatory on large roofs, P&R sites, embankments along roads and other unused space.
NL_M_011	25	For existing distribution centers, a feasibility study should be done for a solar roof.
NL_M_011	26	The government is leading by example, putting panels on all its roofs where it can.
NL_M_011	27	In addition, we take advantage of opportunities for solar panels on water, taking into account local nature.
NL_M_011	28	For businesses that do not need to renovate their roofs in the near future, it will be mandatory to install solar panels on their roofs.
NL_M_011	29	"To this end, we include ""solar on company roofs"" with a seven-year payback period in the approved measures list under the Environmental Management Act."
NL_M_014	1	For owners of homes and other buildings, we make it more attractive to insulate, ventilate and purchase a heat pump, including with subsidies and low-cost loans.
NL_M_014	2	There will be a favorable scheme for green roofs and facades and rainwater harvesting facilities.
NL_M_014	3	We ensure that reliable and practical information about energy-neutral and climate-proof (re)building is widely available.
NL_M_014	4	We require owners of rental properties to invest in the energy performance of their homes.
NL_M_014	5	The bill for making social housing climate-neutral should not fall on tenants.
NL_M_014	6	All new home construction is gasless, energy-neutral and includes standard nature features, such as nesting boxes for birds.
NL_M_014	7	From the design phase, architects, installers and experts are involved to build climate-proof.
NL_M_014	8	We set standards for the use of circular building materials, such as recycled concrete, wood and reusable bricks.
NL_M_014	9	Municipalities are working with residents and businesses to make neighborhoods natural gas-free.
NL_M_014	10	They will have more financial and legal opportunities to do so.
NL_M_014	11	We bet on electricity, geothermal heat (geothermal) and heat from water (aquathermy) as sustainable sources for heating buildings and industry.
NL_M_014	12	Additionally, waste heat from industry can be used to heat homes, but this should never get in the way of making industry more sustainable.
NL_M_014	13	Where necessary, we arrange financial compensation for people whose neighborhoods switch to alternatives to gas.
NL_M_014	14	We ensure a level (financial) playing field for collective heat solutions.
NL_M_014	15	We choose the economic and social strength of regions.
NL_M_014	16	From green hydrogen in Groningen to sustainable chemistry in South Limburg, from wind energy in Zeeland to Foodvalley in Gelderland, from Brainport Eindhoven to GreenBizIJmond.
NL_M_014	17	A directing role of the national government is needed in this regard to counter regional inequality and distribute jobs and wealth more fairly across the Netherlands.
NL_M_014	18	We make sufficient funds available to repair and strengthen homes in Groningen's natural gas area and invest in developing the region.
NL_M_014	19	The policy of spreading government services across the country is gaining momentum.
NL_M_014	20	The Caribbean Netherlands will provide its own energy and become a pioneer in the Caribbean.
NL_M_014	21	We support Curaçao in closing and rehabilitating the Isla refinery, creating space for housing, tourism and sustainable economic development.
NL_M_014	22	Small and medium-sized businesses are the job champions of the Netherlands.
NL_M_014	23	These hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs, with their local and regional involvement, play an indispensable economic and social role in society.
NL_M_014	24	With support and incentives for green and social entrepreneurship, help with digitalization, SME-friendly public procurement and making European cooperation easier in border regions, we are ensuring that SMEs can continue to play this role even after the corona crisis.
NL_M_014	25	We ensure a level playing field for small and medium-sized businesses versus large corporations.
NL_M_014	26	Innovative companies are drivers of the new economy.
NL_M_014	27	Innovations for circular economy, (bio)medical technology, digital technology, games, platforms and 3D printing have become part and parcel of our society.
NL_M_014	28	We encourage businesses that contribute to a green and fair economy.
NL_M_014	29	We do this by opening the Climate Fund to them and strengthening (European) networks between innovative companies, knowledge institutions and larger companies.
NL_M_014	30	Following the tobacco advertising ban, advertising for products and services that cause substantial climate damage will be banned, starting with an advertising ban on stunt offers for air travel and polluting cars such as SUVs.
NL_M_014	31	Energy companies should not advertise fossil fuels.
NL_M_014	32	As long as the main business of energy companies is fossil, all other advertising is also prohibited for them.
NL_M_014	33	In the coming cabinet period, we will grant the licenses for 60 gigawatts of additional clean electricity from wind turbines in the North Sea.
NL_M_014	34	Those wind turbines must be there no later than 2040.
NL_M_014	35	Solar panels and green roofs join the list of mandatory energy-saving measures for owners of large buildings.
NL_M_014	36	The government is leading by example by accelerating the sustainability of government property, delivering every new government building climate-neutral and investing in making schools, sports facilities, healthcare buildings and cultural institutions more sustainable.
NL_M_014	37	We are investing in more power grid capacity.
NL_M_014	38	In addition, energy conservation is essential; it is becoming an important part of decisions about new technology, digital infrastructure, building and transportation.
NL_M_014	39	Nuclear power plants are not an option for renewable energy generation.
NL_M_014	40	Building a power plant takes decades, the climate crisis does not wait for that.
NL_M_014	41	In addition, the construction and decommissioning of a nuclear power plant cost tens of billions of dollars, making nuclear power in no way economically viable.
NL_M_014	42	Not for nothing can no company be found that wants to build a nuclear power plant in the Netherlands.
NL_M_014	43	Not to mention the risk of disastrous accidents and the radioactive waste we would saddle countless generations after us with.
NL_M_014	44	As potentially interesting options for the future, we do support research on thorium and nuclear fusion.
NL_M_015	1	Especially in times of crisis, you realize what really matters - in public health and also more broadly in the economy.
NL_M_015	2	We experienced which people do indispensable work.
NL_M_015	3	We are forced to think about the future.
NL_M_015	4	A crisis shows us that together we are stronger.
NL_M_015	5	And that shows the importance of public service.
NL_M_015	6	No resilient society without strong government.
NL_M_015	7	Our faith in a fair economy is being tested.
NL_M_015	8	Big Tech appropriates our data and uses large untaxed profits to buy up promising competitors.
NL_M_015	9	Multinationals play governments against each other in a battle for the lowest tax rates and the fewest protections for workers.
NL_M_015	10	The profits are for shareholders, the costs and risks for people and planet.
NL_M_015	11	Not good jobs, but low costs drive the economy.
NL_M_015	12	Not society, but the lowest tax rate determines the actions of corporations.
NL_M_015	13	Government seems infected with this logic.
NL_M_015	14	Not education or healthcare, but a low budget deficit is the highest good.
NL_M_015	15	Knowledge, power and income are increasingly unequally distributed.
NL_M_015	16	Between Randstad and region.
NL_M_015	17	Between people who benefit from technological development, and people who risk losing their jobs because of it.
NL_M_015	18	In the Randstad, hardly anyone can find affordable housing anymore.
NL_M_015	19	There are fewer and fewer jobs and facilities in smaller communities.
NL_M_015	20	High standards of work and environment lose out to the pressures of ever cheaper labor without any protection.
NL_M_015	21	Data are the new gold.
NL_M_015	22	We cannot afford for this crucial information to be managed by companies and countries with reprehensible norms and values.
NL_M_015	23	We choose an economy in which we reward what is truly of value.
NL_M_015	24	Good and secure work is paramount.
NL_M_015	25	We reward companies that take good care of their employees and the planet.
NL_M_015	26	Those who don't are more heavily taxed.
NL_M_015	27	We say goodbye to the earnings model based on low wages and precarious work.
NL_M_015	28	We invest heavily in education, research and the development of new technologies.
NL_M_015	29	We do not compete on price, but on quality.
NL_M_015	30	Over the past few decades, normal household wages have stagnated while corporate profits reached record highs.
NL_M_015	31	That's not fair.
NL_M_015	32	Therefore, with the Fair Sharing Act, companies give employees a mandatory bonus in dividend payments.
NL_M_015	33	Furthermore, we encourage the return of automatic price compensation for employees as standard in collective bargaining agreements.
NL_M_015	34	Employees will have more say in the company's direction.
NL_M_015	35	They will have the right to vote on major decisions, such as acquisitions, diversity at the top, dividend payments and maximum pay differentials between top and regular employees.
NL_M_015	36	Broad prosperity comes first in the national budget.
NL_M_015	37	It is precisely in bad times that the government invests.
NL_M_015	38	In this way we prevent unemployment from rising needlessly, facilities and services remain intact, and the economy and society are ready for the future.
NL_M_015	39	European budget rules have become increasingly complicated in recent years and gave too little room for government to play an important role in a crisis.
NL_M_015	40	Therefore, there will be new agreements in Europe on responsible public finances.
NL_M_015	41	In doing so, governments are given room to invest in a fair and decent economy with enough jobs.
NL_M_015	42	When it comes to investment, Broad Prosperity is paramount; not just Gross Domestic Product.
NL_M_015	43	In tenders, the focus is not cost but quality of work.
NL_M_015	44	Current competition and procurement rules are written from a sacred belief in neoliberal market thinking.
NL_M_015	45	In it, citizens are reduced to consumers.
NL_M_015	46	Those with the most economic power often pull the longest straw.
NL_M_015	47	Not quality, but cost is the focus.
NL_M_015	48	That has to change.
NL_M_015	49	We want adaptation of European procurement and competition rules that put people and planet first, not the market.
NL_M_015	50	Thus, good working conditions and sustainability requirements are also considered.
NL_M_015	51	Our tax system makes the economy more fair, decent and sustainable.
NL_M_015	52	A fair economy means that we all pay taxes nicely, because tax money pays for the things that are good for all of us.
NL_M_015	53	Too often in recent times there seemed to be a welfare state for big multinationals and raw capitalism for the rest.
NL_M_015	54	In distributing the bill of the crisis, we protect people as much as possible and place the bill on those who can carry it best: the multinationals, the wealthy, top earners and big polluters.
NL_M_022	1	The Netherlands is a clean country.
NL_M_022	2	A country with beautiful nature, clean air and a good environment.
NL_M_022	3	A country to be proud of.
NL_M_022	4	Our Dutch landscape is unique and world-renowned.
NL_M_022	5	A landscape to be cherished and deserves our protection from destructive climate policies such as wind turbines and solar farms.
NL_M_022	6	CO2 is a nutrient source for everything that grows and flourishes.
NL_M_022	7	Consequently, climate policy, which is all about reducing CO2 emissions, has very little to do with nature or the environment.
NL_M_022	8	No one is against green living or a good environment, including the PVV.
NL_M_022	9	What the PVV does oppose is senseless, unaffordable climate policy.
NL_M_022	10	Humans are responsible for only a few percent of all CO2 in the atmosphere.
NL_M_022	11	Therefore, it is an illusion that humans could substantially affect climate.
NL_M_022	12	The tiny Netherlands accounts for only 0.35% of total global CO2 emissions: negligible.
NL_M_022	13	Dutch climate policy leads to a lesser global warming of only 0.00007 degrees: also negligible.
NL_M_022	14	"Yet CO2 has been declared ""the great enemy."
NL_M_022	15	The obsessive, far-reaching fight against CO2 emissions now exhibits dictatorial traits.
NL_M_022	16	Dutch people who want to live their lives normally are made to feel climate guilt and fear of climate change in everything they do.
NL_M_022	17	Climate policy costs many, many billions and plunges households into the financial abyss.
NL_M_022	18	Climate policy is good for nothing, but it curtails our free way of life all the more radically: we are ruled by climate hippies who want us to take our homes off the gas for many tens of thousands of dollars, even though gas is the cleanest fossil fuel.
NL_M_022	19	They want us to drive unaffordable electric cars.
NL_M_022	20	They want us to fly less, eat less meat.
NL_M_022	21	It's all being forced on us, and that has to stop.
NL_M_022	22	At the same time, our land and our North Sea are being filled with subsidy-guzzling wind turbines.
NL_M_022	23	Trees are burned in polluting biomass plants.
NL_M_022	24	Pastures are being sacrificed for solar farms.
NL_M_022	25	"Our beautiful landscape is being destroyed under the guise of a nonexistent ""climate crisis."
NL_M_022	26	That, too, must stop.
NL_M_022	27	The PVV says: we will not be lectured to by unworldly climate preachers.
NL_M_022	28	That is why we are putting an end to the totally radicalized climate madness: the Climate Act, the Climate Agreement and all nonsensical measures are immediately thrown in the trash.
NL_M_022	29	We abolish all climate and sustainability subsidies immediately.
NL_M_022	30	No more money for nonsensical leftist pastimes, but more money in our people's pockets.
NL_M_022	31	Because because of all the billions in subsidies wasted on green terror, energy bills go up and up.
NL_M_022	32	While households in Germany receive money when they take a gas connection, gas in the Netherlands is being made increasingly expensive.
NL_M_022	33	Already, hundreds of thousands of households live in energy poverty: they can barely, if at all, pay their energy bills and often literally sit on the couch shivering with cold.
NL_M_022	34	Energy is a basic need, but the climate frenzy has turned it into an extremely expensive luxury item.
NL_M_022	35	The PVV opts for a substantially lower, affordable energy bill: we will stop the money-consuming energy transition and reduce the energy tax.
NL_M_022	36	Homes will not be taken off the gas.
NL_M_022	37	We are reversing the abolition of the gas connection requirement, allowing new construction homes to once again have a trusted gas connection - to the best and most reliable gas grid in the world.
NL_M_022	38	Gas will no longer come from Groningen, but will be taken from the bottom of the North Sea and imported from countries like Norway, England etc. - as is already happening now.
NL_M_022	39	Our coal-fired power plants, which are among the cleanest in the world, remain open.
NL_M_022	40	Nuclear power plants are also being built that are safer than ever.
NL_M_022	41	In addition, we are betting on thorium.
NL_M_024	1	Everyone who contributes to society to the best of their ability can fall back on protection when the going gets tough.
NL_M_024	2	The government has a responsibility to guarantee a basic level of social security for every Dutch citizen.
NL_M_024	3	This includes a well-functioning social safety net focused on income protection and support toward new employment.
NL_M_024	4	Our goal is for as many people as possible to be at work, rather than standing along the sidelines.
NL_M_024	5	In doing so, we apply the principles of flexicurity: higher unemployment benefits that go down the longer they last, simpler dismissal laws and strong reintegration into new work.
NL_M_024	6	In the coming years, we are committed to:
NL_M_024	7	More social protection through higher benefits immediately after job loss.
NL_M_024	8	The unemployment benefit goes up in the first few months is then phased out.
NL_M_024	9	As a result, the WW limits the loss of income upon dismissal and encourages people to find new work as soon as possible.
NL_M_024	10	Modernize severance law so that small business owners hire people faster.
NL_M_024	11	In doing so, the courts cannot force a business owner to retain someone who does not function or who disrupts personal relationships.
NL_M_024	12	On the other hand, the court can impose higher compensation after wrongful dismissal.
NL_M_024	13	Less risk for employers to hire people indefinitely.
NL_M_024	14	Employers pay less premium for people on indefinite contracts, so it pays to hire people on a permanent basis.
NL_M_024	15	We also encourage employers to offer more full-time contracts.
NL_M_024	16	Modern forms of contract such as on-call, payroll and agency contracts do remain possible to organize unpredictable work and relieve small employers.
NL_M_024	17	Young people under 21 will be exempted from the high WW premium for flexible and temporary contracts.
NL_M_024	18	Better guidance to work.
NL_M_024	19	We make it attractive for welfare recipients to start working part-time by increasing additional earnings limits.
NL_M_024	20	Those applying for welfare benefits receive an intake interview during which a concrete plan towards employment is drawn up.
NL_M_024	21	In doing so, we also improve job opportunities for people with disabilities, through guidance and support in the workplace and by ensuring that work always pays off.
NL_M_024	22	We always look at what people can do and make sure people are less likely to be written off.
NL_M_024	23	For groups for which the step to regular work is still too big, we ensure that help, such as sheltered work and apprenticeships, is more readily available and ensure that existing budgets within the social domain can be used more for these (public) apprenticeships.
NL_M_024	24	A transparent assessment system (estimation decision) for disability, more in line with practice.
NL_M_024	25	In doing so, we look at what people can do and are less likely to write people off.
NL_M_024	26	One merged and more transferable leave system for things like birth, parenthood, short-term care and emergencies, so that people can use leave in a way that suits their situation.
NL_M_024	27	A higher minimum wage so that working pays more even for lower-income earners.
NL_M_024	28	We are making sure that work pays more and that as many people as possible get to work.
NL_M_024	29	In doing so, we are making the existing payroll benefits more targeted.
NL_M_024	30	Benefits such as welfare do not automatically rise with the minimum wage, with the exception of state pension and disability.
NL_M_024	31	Activating people on welfare through quid pro quo.
NL_M_024	32	We ask everyone to make a maximum effort to master Dutch sufficiently (B1 level).
NL_M_024	33	We want people to participate in society and our social security is geared to that end.
NL_M_024	34	Low literacy is a major barrier to employment for many people.
NL_M_024	35	Personal attention to a welfare recipient's guidance from the municipality is essential in this regard.
NL_M_024	36	There will also be performance agreements with municipalities to prevent local minimum policies from creating new poverty traps.
NL_M_024	37	Bringing back the human touch in implementation.
NL_M_024	38	There have been too many examples in recent years of citizens and business owners being unfairly classified as fraudsters.
NL_M_024	39	Tackling fraud should not result in someone who makes a mistake being immediately labeled a fraudster.
NL_M_024	40	To change this, we are strengthening internal checks in implementation while reducing unclear, legal language in government communications.
NL_M_024	41	Improving the human touch in implementation includes an explicit focus on accessible communication, both at physical locations and by phone, mail, email and through other (digital) means.
TR_006	1	Over 5,000 fossils found in 'Çorakyerler' in 24 years
TR_006	2	Under the direction of Prof. Dr. Ayla Sevim Erol, Head of the Department of Anthropology at Ankara University, Faculty of Language, History and Geography, excavations have been meticulously carried out for 24 years to uncover fossils belonging to vertebrate animals in the Fatih Neighborhood.
TR_006	3	Prof. Dr. Ayla Sevim Erol, AA correspondent, said that in the first years they started excavations, they encountered a very complex and dense fossil potential, but in the following years, more homogeneous and articulated fossils began to emerge.
TR_006	4	"""Stating that they found many rhinoceros skulls in the first years and that these were exhibited in Çankırı Museum, Erol said the following: ""When we entered this area in 1997, we first excavated in an area about 100 meters long."
TR_006	5	The excavations we did every year with dental tools like digging a well with a needle because the environments where the fossils were found were unfortunately very hardened clay layers, clay layers that had become very petrified or even rocks.
TR_006	6	Even the dental instruments we use in excavations do not hold up from time to time.
TR_006	7	We have fed up with dentists, we are going to buy dental tools, so we are taking all the dental tools that we know dentists don't use and we are coming to excavate because the excavation tools really don't last in the area.
TR_006	8	"Hammers and shovels break very quickly."""
TR_006	9	"Stating that fossilized areas are usually located in high mountainous and hilly areas that are very difficult and troublesome to reach, Erol said, ""However, the area we are working in is an area located in the heart of the city."
TR_006	10	But is that good or bad?
TR_006	11	"On the one hand, there are pros, it is an area that can be easily worked, on the other hand, there are cons, it is an area that can be easily destroyed because it is located on the road and its protection is quite troublesome."""
TR_006	12	Explaining that they have carried out excavations in an area of approximately 5 thousand square meters until today, Erol said that when they first started excavations in the area, they dated the fossils up to 7.5-8 million years ago, and emphasized that the fossils of animals found in recent excavations go back to 9 million years ago.
TR_006	13	"""We may encounter a new species at any moment"" Explaining that they can say that Çankırı had a rich nature covered with forests, wetlands, elephants, rhinos, horses and predators millions of years ago with the fossils that have been unearthed, Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. İsmail Demir stated that Çankırı has a rich nature with elephants, rhinos, horses and predators."
TR_006	14	Dr.
TR_006	15	"Erol gave the following information: ""Therefore, it is a locality inhabited by a group of animal fauna dated between 9 million and 8 million years, where there are forested areas, abundant freshwater ponds and river beds, open grassland savanna environments and abundant forested areas, from the fossils of the ancestors of the horses found in large numbers, we identify 3 different ecological environments."
TR_006	16	In this context, fossil finds belonging to more than 40 species such as rhinos, horses, wild horses, hyena (hyena), saw-toothed felines and various types of carnivores as well as antelope, deer, wild sheep and goats, bison, elephants and giraffes were found.
TR_006	17	We may encounter a new species at any time in these studies.
TR_006	18	So far, the total numbered fossils in this area, that is, the numbered fossils that we can identify the species, are over 4 thousand.
TR_006	19	Apart from that, some important unnumbered fossils can also be found in other sediments.
TR_006	20	"When we add them all together, more than 5 thousand fossils were found."""

TR_026	1	Is early diagnosis possible in ALS?
TR_026	2	Corum Private Hospital si Neurology Specialist Uzm.
TR_026	3	Dr.
TR_026	4	In his statement on June 21, World ALS Day, Okan Delikan gave information about ALS disease and diagnosis.
TR_026	5	WHAT IS ALS, MOTOR NEURON DISEASE?
TR_026	6	Stating that ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and Motor Neuron Disease are generally used in the same sense in the world, Uzm.
TR_026	7	Dr.
TR_026	8	"Okan Delikan said, ""The 2 groups of nerve cells of the system that makes voluntary movements (pyramidal system) are called motorneurons."
TR_026	9	The nerve cells from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord are called first motor neurons (upper motor neurons).
TR_026	10	The electrical impulses generated in the motor center of our brain are transmitted to the spinal cord by a nerve cell called the 1st motor neuron (alpha motor neuron).
TR_026	11	The second motor neuron (lower motor neuron) starts in the region of the spinal cord called the anterior horn. The passage of electrical impulses between the 1st and 2nd motor neuron takes place through chemical processes in a space called the synapse.
TR_026	12	The electrical impulse transmitted from the synapse gap to the 2nd motor neuron is transmitted from the spinal cord to the relevant muscle area.
TR_026	13	With this electrical impulse, our muscles work.
TR_026	14	Diseases affecting the first and/or second motor neuron are generally referred to as Motor Neuron Disease.
TR_026	15	ALS is just one of the diseases that affect these nerves.
TR_026	16	The cause of the damage to motor nerves is unknown, but the disease is neurodegenerative, i.e. destructive.
TR_026	17	"Many factors such as certain environmental factors such as pesticides and heavy metals, hormonal disorders, vitamin deficiency, viruses, cancer have been suspected to cause the disease, but there has not been enough evidence for any of them."""
TR_026	18	Uzm. Dr. Okan Delikan gave the following information about ALS: WHO CAN GET ALS?
TR_026	19	ALS is not a contagious disease; it can occur anywhere in the world and in people from all walks of life.
TR_026	20	It is slightly more common in men.
TR_026	21	The average age of onset is 55 years.
TR_026	22	However, it can occur at a very young age or at a very advanced age.
TR_026	23	About 2-6 per 100,000 of the population has ALS.
TR_026	24	WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?
TR_026	25	Symptoms are not the same in every patient.
TR_026	26	Usually, weakness or thinning in one arm or leg is the first symptom the patient notices.
TR_026	27	For example, it becomes difficult to hold a pen, button a button, carry a bag; or the patient stumbles when walking.
TR_026	28	In some patients, the disease starts with speech or swallowing difficulties.
TR_026	29	The patient or relatives notice a lisp or nasal speech.
TR_026	30	These symptoms may be accompanied by muscle twitching, pain and cramps.
TR_026	31	There may be uncontrollable crying and laughing.
TR_026	32	WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR ALS?
TR_026	33	Of all ALS patients, 90% are sporadic (individual) and 10% are familial ALS patients.
TR_026	34	Half of familial ALS patients are also inherited.
TR_026	35	It can therefore be said that the disease is largely unrelated to heredity.
TR_026	36	Another characteristic of ALS patients is that they fit a certain personality profile.
TR_026	37	These patients are usually intelligent, emotional and creative people who have risen in their profession.
TR_026	38	Some epidemiologic data suggest an association between overexertion or certain chemicals and this disease, but there is no definitive proof.
TR_026	39	IS EARLY DIAGNOSIS POSSIBLE?
TR_026	40	ARE THERE STAGES OF THE DISEASE?
TR_026	41	Over time, the weakness spreads from where it started to other areas, such as the muscles of the arms, legs, tongue and pharynx.
TR_026	42	The patient's activities of daily living may be restricted due to muscle wasting, weakness and twitching throughout the body.
TR_026	43	It may not work on its own.
TR_026	44	He cannot eat, dress or bathe.
TR_026	45	He may not even get out of bed.
TR_026	46	The critical period of the disease is when the respiratory muscles also weaken.
TR_026	47	The patient needs immediate and close medical support.
TR_026	48	The course of ALS is different for each patient.
TR_026	49	Although survival is usually given as 4-6 years, there are many patients who live 10 years or more.
TR_026	50	There are ALS patients who live more than 20 years with good medical and social support.
TR_026	51	The reason for this difference is not fully known.
TR_026	52	HOW IS THE DIAGNOSIS MADE?
TR_026	53	Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms.
TR_026	54	Nevertheless, the disease can be confused with many muscle and nerve diseases, so some tests are necessary.
TR_026	55	An electromyogram (EMG) performed by an experienced electroneurophysiologist is the diagnostic tool.
TR_026	56	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, some blood and urine tests, lumbar puncture (examination of lumbar fluid), muscle biopsy may be required, as they may be confused with other diseases.
TR_026	57	WHICH SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT?
TR_026	58	The physician checks for distinctive neuronal signs including; muscle atrophy (loss of muscle volume), muscle weakness, twitching, increased muscle tone, changes in normal muscle reflexes.
TR_026	59	If the neurologist finds signs of motor neurons in at least three parts of the patient's body, a definitive diagnosis of MNH can be made.
TR_026	60	IS THERE A CURE FOR THE DISEASE?
TR_026	61	Unfortunately, there is no definitive cure for ALS yet.
TR_026	62	Nevertheless, work on new drugs continues intensively.
TR_026	63	Special medication for ALS patients is used to reduce the amount of glutamate in the body, thus slowing the progression of the disease.
TR_026	64	This treatment not only prolongs the patient's life, but also delays the onset of ventilator dependency or, in appropriate patients, the surgical opening of a hole in the trachea (tracheotomy).
TR_026	65	On the other hand, it is very important to make the patient as comfortable as possible and to provide supportive treatments that will enable the patient to lead a normal life.
TR_026	66	Today, there are many possibilities for rehabilitation of the patient.
TR_026	67	These are determined according to the needs of each patient.
TR_026	68	"Drug treatments for muscle pain, cramps and muscle stiffness (spasticity), treatment with a psychiatric approach to patients and their relatives for changes in emotional state, treatment of speech problems with a speech therapist, medication for increased salivation and swallowing problems or tube feeding treatment called PEG, pain treatment, tracheotomy or connection to a respirator for the treatment of respiratory problems."""

TR_030	20	"""We can't let Putin take over Ukraine,"" Tesla's CEO said about Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy: ""My best guess is that he will try to take over the eastern third of the country."
TR_030	21	Obviously, if you listened to the speeches, it's clear that he's going to push for the parts of Ukraine where at least a significant part of the population speaks Russian.
TR_030	22	"He has already done this in Georgia."""
TR_030	23	"""I THINK I CAN HELP IN CONFLICTS"" Musk, ""Are you a strategic weapon in war?"""

TR_030	26	And frankly, sometimes I make mistakes in this regard.
TR_030	27	"I am doing what I think is most likely to ensure that the future is good for humanity."""
TR_030	28	According to Independent Turkish, Musk launched Starlink, a satellite internet system project, in Ukraine in February to prevent disruption of internet access.
TR_030	29	"""I hope we don't have to put it to the test, but I think we can send satellites faster than the missiles they can fire at satellites,"" Musk said about what would happen if Russia and China targeted these satellites."
TR_030	30	Musk also clearly expressed his thoughts on nuclear power plants.

TR_049	16	We will not catch last year's figure but we will see that we will start to rise.
TR_049	17	We strive to solve the problems in tourism during the pandemic.
TR_049	18	Those who put their trust in the forces upon which the pandemic and the political economic social problems associated with it have collapsed are doomed to be disappointed.
TR_049	19	We invite those who have failed to understand Turkey's determination to see the truth.

TR_052	1	Remarkable Message from the President of the Constitutional Court
TR_052	2	"Zühtü Arslan, President of the Constitutional Court, said: ""Where the courts are unable to respond to the search for justice and find solutions to disputes in accordance with the principles of independent and impartial adjudication, it is inevitable that extra-legal searches will emerge."""
TR_052	3	"A symposium on ""The Right to Respect for Private Life in the Context of Professional Life"" was organized at the Constitutional Court."
TR_052	4	"Emphasizing that discussions on the right to privacy continue in many countries, Arslan said: ""In his novel 1984, the British George Orwell depicted a dystopian world in a frightening way."
TR_052	5	Orwell expressed the internalization of surveillance as follows: 'The assumption that your every sound was heard, that your every move was watched unless you were in the dark, had become an instinctive habit, you had to live with it - you did'.
TR_052	6	According to Orwell, the most effective surveillance tool of 'big brother' power is television.
TR_052	7	"Technical advances that allowed television to be used ""both as a transmitter and receiver put an end to privacy""."
TR_052	8	Orwell passed away two years after he completed his book in 1948, long before the invention of the internet and smart cell phones.
TR_052	9	If he were alive today, he would marvel that the dystopian world he described in his book has been perfectly realized, even surpassed.
TR_052	10	"He would probably be horrified to see the emergence of an omnipresent 'global big brother' who can monitor even those in the dark with cameras that can be found almost every step of the way in these days of the so-called digital age, who can track locations with software, who sees without being seen, who is ready and available everywhere."""
TR_052	11	"Commenting on the security investigation and archive search for those who will be recruited to the public sector, Arslan said, ""This is equally valid for dismissal from public office within the framework of loyalty and devotion to the state."
TR_052	12	In other words, the state will be able to take action to dismiss or otherwise administratively sanction public officials who it determines to be in breach of the constitutional duty of loyalty.
TR_052	13	"In this sense, dismissal from public office can be characterized as an interference with the right to respect for private life based on the cause and / or result due to the close relationship between professional life and private life."""
TR_052	14	"Constitutional Court President Arslan stated the following: ""Guaranteeing the right to respect for private life and privacy is of utmost importance for the protection and development of the individual's material and spiritual existence, autonomy and freedom."
TR_052	15	In addition, it should not be forgotten that a rule of law in which fundamental rights and freedoms are protected and legal security is ensured is also a sine qua non condition for a welfare state.
TR_052	16	Indeed, like other sayings under the sun, this one is not new.
TR_052	17	Tunuslu Hayreddin Pasha, who was also a grand vizier for a period in the Ottoman Empire, made this determination years ago and conveyed it to us in his book.
TR_052	18	According to Tunuslu Hayreddin Pasha, who shared his observations on the institutions of the countries he traveled to in Europe in his book published eight years before the proclamation of the Constitutional Law, 'the countries that have reached the highest levels of prosperity are those that have put the principles of freedom and the constitution, which corresponds to political reform, in place'.
TR_052	19	Undoubtedly, today, as in the past, the judiciary has the greatest duty to restore the principles of freedom and the Constitution.
TR_052	20	When this duty is fulfilled properly, trust in the judiciary will rise to the desired level.
TR_052	21	Therefore, as members of the judiciary, we have to constantly review and renew ourselves in self-criticism and accounting.
TR_052	22	"This is our debt of conscience to the law, to justice and ultimately to our nation to which we belong."""

TR_060	19	"It is a necessity, a condition for the EU to support Turkey on this issue."""
TR_060	20	"Stating that much has improved in Turkey and that standards have risen despite economic problems, Merkel said, ""Turkey is an important partner for us as a NATO ally."

TR_060	22	"Stating that she made some criticisms about human rights and individual freedoms during her tenure, Merkel said: ""Of course we looked for solutions."
TR_060	23	We may have different points of view.
TR_060	24	We are geostrategically interdependent and dependent on each other.

TR_060	33	And of course, it is not possible for us to postpone these people like Greece did, we cannot do that.
TR_060	34	We continue to host them in the same way and we will continue to do so.

TR_063	1	April 25, 1999 Silent Peaceful Protest
TR_063	2	April 25, 1999; They came quietly, sat peacefully and left quietly.
TR_063	3	April 25, 1999 marked a turning point in Chinese history.
TR_063	4	Some people with a close interest in China describe this as one of the most severe crackdowns on a spiritual development practice (Falun Gong) in modern times.
TR_063	5	Mr. Li Hongzhi, the Nobel Peace Prize nominated founder of the Falun Gong self-improvement practice, began teaching his practice to the public in 1992.
TR_063	6	"Falun Gong, a completely free qigong practice based on the principles of ""Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance"", has rapidly gained popularity across China."
TR_063	7	However, with nearly 100 million people practicing Falun Dafa in China at the time, far exceeding the Chinese Communist Party's membership of 65 million, the Chinese government saw Falun Gong as a threat.
TR_063	8	On April 11th, 1999, Luo Gan (a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party Political Bureau from 2001-2007 and the person responsible for the persecution of Falun Gong), under instructions from the Tianjin University magazine, made severe accusations against Falun Gong.
TR_063	9	In response, Falun Gong practitioners traveled 120 km to Tianjin and held a demonstration to peacefully explain Falun Gong.
TR_063	10	Their aim was simply to tell the truth, but the state met them with severe violence and arrested 45 people.
TR_063	11	"After the incident, practitioners demanding the release of those arrested were told: ""We cannot help you here."""
TR_063	12	Since Tianjin is under the central government in Beijing, practitioners were directed to Beijing.
TR_063	13	After that, many Falun Dafa practitioners went to Beijing on April 25th, 1999.
TR_063	14	Practitioners wanted to go to the National Appeals Office to demand the release of detainees.
TR_063	15	However, practitioners who were received in Beijing by Chinese State Security authorities were directed to the gate of Zhongnanhai, the seat of government, via two separate routes.
TR_063	16	One of the interesting things was that there were many cameras on the streets that day.
TR_063	17	On that day, instead of the usual police presence, a large number of soldiers with rifles were waiting in the vehicles, ready and waiting.
TR_063	18	It was as if they were waiting for an instruction.
TR_063	19	Falun Gong practitioners were also waiting-they waited for 16 hours.
TR_063	20	According to Chinese security expert Ethan Gutmann (Nobel Peace Prize nominee), state security forces wanted to set a trap for Falun Gong practitioners in government territory.
TR_063	21	They had worked on a scenario and through this scenario they were going to create a bloodbath.
TR_063	22	The appeals office never opened that day.
TR_063	23	Falun Gong practitioners waited calmly.
TR_063	24	Eventually, then Prime Minister Zhu Rongji met with the five petitioners and promised that those arrested in Tianjin would be released.
TR_063	25	The practitioners then dispersed in silence.
TR_063	26	On April 24th, 1999, 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered to petition the Beijing Appeals Office, but were directed by security forces to the Zhongnanhai Government District.
TR_063	27	(Photo: Minghui)
TR_063	28	"However, the Chinese Communist Party later called this incident a ""siege of government territory"" and used it as the biggest excuse for the unthinkable persecution of Falun Gong that began on July 20, 1999."
TR_063	29	At that time, Falun Dafa practitioners were banned from going to school, so a Falun Gong practitioner could not enter university.
TR_063	30	Practitioners were thrown out of their workplaces and prevented by the state from taking their place in society.
TR_063	31	Falun Gong practitioners were imprisoned, tortured and killed. April 25th, 1999, a peaceful protest followed by a massive genocide, dubbed 'A Black Spot in the History of Humanity'
TR_073	1	Imamoğlu: ISKI Cannot Supply Water Below Cost
TR_073	2	Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB) Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu held a press conference on the rejection of his proposal for a raise in ISKI.
TR_073	3	"Speaking at the meeting held at ISKOM (Istanbul Water Control and Automation Center) in Eyüpsultan Güzeltepe Neighborhood, Imamoğlu said, ""ISKI, so to speak, is like the vein of life, like a vein of the human body... This is what it means for Istanbul."
TR_073	4	Because we manage water, the indispensable source of life, at ISKI.
TR_073	5	"ISKI is an ancient institution."""
TR_073	6	"""But today, I am here to share with you a really evil game being played against our Istanbul,"" Imamoğlu said, adding, ""For 2 years, I have been talking about ISKI without getting involved in the issue, patiently, by setting up common tables, by talking face to face many times and while making these negotiations, We have shared all the accounts of ISKI with all the political stakeholders in IBB, without discriminating between political parties, both to the parliamentary commissions and the deputy group chairmen in the parliament, and the sensitive situation of ISKI, both myself, our general manager and other executives, with great effort,"" he said."
TR_073	7	"Stating that the budget of 10 billion 300 million liras for İSKİ increased to 14 billion 900 million liras in November, İmamoğlu said to the deputy group chairmen, ""Let's put a price tariff for Istanbul."
TR_073	8	With this price tariff, I sincerely conveyed that we can supply Istanbul's water without interruption.
TR_073	9	And I saw the faces of three sincere people.
TR_073	10	'Of course.
TR_073	11	We will do it.
TR_073	12	Let's work together,' they said.
TR_073	13	And I felt it as a reassurance.
TR_073	14	"After that, my friends and I started this dialog process."""
TR_073	15	"Imamoğlu said, ""In 3 years, only the increase in natural gas is 102 percent."
TR_073	16	So, the costs that ISKI talks about are a result, not a cause.
TR_073	17	Electricity, 283 percent.
TR_073	18	And electricity is so important for ISKI that almost 25 percent of ISKI's expenditure is electricity.
TR_073	19	According to my friends' estimates, according to the current electricity tariff, the electricity bill in 2022 will exceed 3 billion liras.
TR_073	20	It's as simple as that.
TR_073	21	There is no need to jump up and down.
TR_073	22	Did I raise the electricity?
TR_073	23	I didn't do it.
TR_073	24	Conclusion.
TR_073	25	We are talking about the result.
TR_073	26	The reason is elsewhere, not us.
TR_073	27	Diesel, 135 percent.
TR_073	28	Eurasia Tunnel; you will say, 'What does it have to do with anything?
TR_073	29	ISKI should not raise the price, but Eurasia Tunnel should.
TR_073	30	Simple.
TR_073	31	127 percent.
TR_073	32	I am sharing with you a cost picture that Turkey is facing.
TR_073	33	Last year, the dollar was 7.5 liras.
TR_073	34	Today it is 13.5 liras.
TR_073	35	The chemicals we use to make Istanbul's water healthy come in foreign currency and we are facing an enormous increase there.
TR_073	36	"Three to 300 percent on some items."""
TR_073	37	"Giving examples of the chemicals in question and their costs, İmamoğlu said, ""As a result, in just one year, the costs of our ISKI organization, which supplies water to our Istanbul, have increased by 120 percent."
TR_073	38	Inevitably, we brought a new water tariff to the ISKI General Assembly.
TR_073	39	We have to bring it.
TR_073	40	What did we say?
TR_073	41	"We said, ""Let the increase be 50 percent for users up to 10 cubic meters, so that our citizens who use water economically or who have low income will be affected a little less."
TR_073	42	Look, our cost is 120 percent from 2021 to 2022, but we say, 'Let it be 50 percent.
TR_073	43	When we introduce a new price tariff, we also take into account some negative budget.
TR_073	44	Look, that's a crime too.
TR_073	45	I will talk about why it is a crime.
TR_073	46	Why?
TR_073	47	As ISKI, we are also trying to stand by our citizens. For those using 11 to 20 cubic meters, we said that the increase in the new tariff should be 69 percent.
TR_073	48	"For those who use at a higher level, that is, those who consume excessive water, we said that this increase should be 80 percent."""
TR_073	49	"""We explained why this new price tariff was needed, together with all the income and expenditure items of ISKI, to all my authorized colleagues, to the budget commission, the law commission and the AK Party Group Deputy Chairman in the Metropolitan Municipality, one by one, in such a simple way that our youngest child can understand."
TR_073	50	"I mean, everyone knows very well what is what,"" İmamoğlu said, adding, ""A friend comes out and says, '90 percent, 179 percent, 180 percent raise offer'."
TR_073	51	I am ashamed.
TR_073	52	Do you know why?
TR_073	53	I am saddened by the words of these friends.
TR_073	54	These are the deputy group chairmen of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
TR_073	55	It's a shame, a pity, a sin.
TR_073	56	There is math.
TR_073	57	My friend may not understand what I am saying, but when you divide the increase figure by the previous price, you will find the rate of increase.
TR_073	58	It is the most basic rule in mathematics.
TR_073	59	I think this is now taught in the second or third grade of primary school.
TR_073	60	I don't understand how this friend came up with 179 percent, with what mind, with what education.
TR_073	61	Therefore, all these are lies.
TR_073	62	"It is not right,"" he said."
TR_073	63	"Imamoğlu said, ""I have news for the friends who are trying to sink ISKI with organized evil: What you are doing is a crime."
TR_073	64	Because according to the law, according to Article 23 of the ISKI Law No. 2560, ISKI cannot supply water below its cost.
TR_073	65	ISKI, which will incur billions of liras in losses because of your anger, be sure that in the very short term, this loss will be reclaimed from every member who voted for this decision, that is, who voted against our proposal, who voted against the revised budget, who voted against the new price tariff.
TR_073	66	In this regard, you will see the bill for the damage you have caused to Istanbul before the law in the courts.
TR_073	67	Believe me, this will happen in the very short term.
TR_073	68	"Now you think about it,"" he said."
TR_074	1	"""One of the last sages of Humanity on the brink of extinction"""
TR_074	2	"Dr. Kai-Uwe Herthneck, a psychotherapist, recently came across the article ""How did humanity come into existence?"" written by Mr. Li Hongzhi."
TR_074	3	This article impressed him so much that he wrote the following article.
TR_074	4	When we look at Master Li Hongzhi, we are dealing with one of the last sages of a humanity on the brink of extinction.
TR_074	5	This is very valuable.
TR_074	6	Because, as he says, chaos reigns in the final stage of the world.
TR_074	7	This is why more and more people are becoming disoriented, above all spiritually and spiritually.
TR_074	8	In addition, there are no longer any real principles that people can largely adopt and trust.
TR_074	9	Because humanity has abandoned all truly ethical and morally guiding principles.
TR_074	10	Worse still, the principles of humanity that prevail today are diametrically opposed to those of the cosmos: He who succeeds in imposing his own truth is right.
TR_074	11	The one with more power wins.
TR_074	12	Whoever acts more ruthlessly defeats his opponent.
TR_074	13	The strongest is the hero, etc.
TR_074	14	But these are not true and virtuous guiding principles.
TR_074	15	These are the ideas that have enslaved humanity for so long and have made people suffer.
TR_074	16	In fact, the opposite is the case: Only those who can remain compassionate in the midst of pain, suffering and conflict will truly attain virtue.
TR_074	17	Of course, this is not only the case in Buddhist-Taoist culture.
TR_074	18	These are facts that have been known since ancient Greek civilization, that is, since Plato and Aristotle.
TR_074	19	If that is the case, how can we reach a higher level of compassion?
TR_074	20	We certainly cannot achieve this through violence, war, domination and oppression.
TR_074	21	Only through really good and sincere behavior can we succeed.
TR_074	22	However, the arms suppliers in today's war zones believe that they are doing something good - and therefore - the compass of goodness in people today is largely inoperative.
TR_074	23	Read this, too, as it offers insightful guidance and accurate direction at this very point.
TR_074	24	It is not just about internalizing a rational and good theory.
TR_074	25	It also means connecting much more inwardly with the cosmos, with the life force of the universe, finding the truth that sustains us spiritually and intuitively shows us what is right and what is really good.
TR_074	26	In a world where every opinion is arbitrarily accepted as true, we desperately need it.
TR_074	27	Because a theory or fact cannot be both good and true at the same time.
TR_074	28	That is why today's human beings must embrace and hold on to traditional values.
TR_074	29	Only in this way can we defend ourselves against the onslaught of modern views arbitrarily imposed upon us.
TR_074	30	If we can do that, we can retain good thoughts and be a really good person, despite the very difficult circumstances of today.
TR_074	31	Because human beings did not come into this world to struggle for too much success and power.
TR_074	32	Because in any case, with his death, everything will lose its meaning.
TR_074	33	The desire for success or power, wanting to rule others, striving for luxury goods or money in general - all these things corrupt people internally.
TR_074	34	How beneficial Falun Dafa is: It sees everything that happens as a karmic consequence of a fundamentally just and whole!
TR_074	35	Simply put, doing good sincerely is a blessing in itself.
TR_074	36	Those who do evil - whether they understand it or not - will surely receive the punishment they deserve in due time.
TR_074	37	So the purpose of accumulating a lot of virtue in earthly life is, as Master Li Hongzhi rightly says: to pave the way to heaven by doing good deeds and keeping a good heart.

TR_080	1	Validebag Grove Resists
TR_080	2	"Saying that they would not give up Validebağ Grove, citizens chanted slogans ""Hilmi resign""."
TR_080	3	"In his press statement, CHP member Özçağdaş said the following: ""First of all, we need to inform the public that Validebag Grove is a natural and historical protected area."
TR_080	4	Whether it is Üsküdar Municipality, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, ministries, governorships, whoever, they have to get approval from the Conservation Board for every action they take here.
TR_080	5	Unfortunately, Üsküdar Municipality calls its duty of care the freedom to do anything without asking anyone.
TR_080	6	This is the most fundamental problem we face today.
TR_080	7	Üsküdar Municipality says, 'If you have an objection, go and get a stay of execution.
TR_080	8	Go and take legal action.'
TR_080	9	We have already won many lawsuits against all these unlawful acts of Üsküdar Municipality.
TR_080	10	But what Üsküdar Municipality needs to understand is that it too needs to get approval from the board for all its actions.
TR_080	11	And today they find what is illegal, what they are clearly committing a crime.
TR_080	12	We hereby call on the prosecutors of the country, the legal authorities of the country.
TR_080	13	Üsküdar Municipality has entered and intervened in a first degree natural and historical protected area by using an authority that it does not have.
TR_080	14	Second: 'We cut the grass here.
TR_080	15	Why are you against cutting the grass?'
TR_080	16	he says.
TR_080	17	Friends who are involved in all these movements have been explaining for years why we are against this.
TR_080	18	There is an insistence not to understand.
TR_080	19	It is not just a question of weed.
TR_080	20	Validebağ is an important ecological protection area not only for Üsküdar, not only for Istanbul, but for the world.
TR_080	21	This place has connections between countries.
TR_080	22	Migrating birds from the northern countries come here and continue their journey from here to Africa.
TR_080	23	This is not an area where someone will take some machines and randomly mow here and there.
TR_080	24	It's not that we don't see the political conspiracy behind trying to explain things in such a simplistic way.
TR_080	25	But it is not as simple as that.
TR_080	26	So all these people are voicing their objections loudly.
TR_080	27	And as you have always seen, without any approval from the board, without any planning, and without any training in this field, people enter Valibağ and mow, collect and remove everything in their way.
TR_080	28	This is an ecological disaster.
TR_080	29	Üsküdar Municipality and the Mayor of Üsküdar should know that all these unlawful acts you have committed, all these encroachments you have made on Validebağ Grove, all these attacks you have made, all of these will be held to account before the law.
TR_080	30	I guarantee you this today.
TR_080	31	We will continue to struggle with the Üsküdar Municipality against what they have done.
TR_080	32	This government, this government that has been attacking people from all walks of life, in all walks of life, may be leaving.
TR_080	33	The bureaucrats of this government may be trying to make the last gains before they go for their lives.
TR_080	34	"But let them not forget that today has a tomorrow and it is coming."""
TR_080	35	"Züleyha Gülüm from HDP said the following: ""The real struggle is to resist."
TR_080	36	That's the truth of the matter.
TR_080	37	Now we talk about it a lot, we say, 'We have received stay of execution decisions', we call it law.
TR_080	38	But there are those who do not recognize the law and say, 'I don't care about court decisions'.
TR_080	39	He even goes further, saying 'I don't care about the European Court of Human Rights'.
TR_080	40	Now, against such an understanding, we say it is unlawful.
TR_080	41	Yes, it is unlawful.
TR_080	42	Yes, one day they will be judged for their lawlessness and rent-seeking mentality.
TR_080	43	But we will not wait for that day, we will solve it with resistance today.
TR_080	44	Resistance is the main thing.
TR_080	45	Because someone says, 'We will open everything to capital.
TR_080	46	We will make our cronies rich.'
TR_080	47	What are we saying?
TR_080	48	We say, 'We will not allow it'.
TR_080	49	Someone says, 'I am in power.
TR_080	50	You voted for me, I can do whatever I want for 5 years.'
TR_080	51	And we say, 'There is nothing like that'.
TR_080	52	We will control the votes we cast or the votes we don't cast, we say that no one can preside here arbitrarily.
TR_080	53	You came here to work for the people, not against them.
TR_080	54	You cannot say that you will come and work for the people when you want to get votes, and then after you sit in the seat, you cannot work for yourself, for your cronies, for rent, you cannot massacre our nature.
TR_080	55	You cannot destroy our habitats.
TR_080	56	If these people are defending this place, they are defending it for the whole community.
TR_080	57	He defends it for the future, he defends it for future generations.
TR_080	58	"Not for your daily interests like you."""
TR_081	1	Successful Artist Dies After Years of Mental Pressure
TR_081	2	Zheng Aixin (Left) and the work he plans to present at the International Figure Painting Competition, an annual cultural and art event hosted by NTDTV (New Tang Dynasty Television).
TR_081	3	(Minghui.org) Everything was going well for Zhen Aixin.
TR_081	4	She was a renowned painter of oil painting and calligraphy, and her husband Li Zheng Tian was a philosopher, designer and award-winning painter and art professor.
TR_081	5	The couple lived a comfortable life in Zhuhai, a coastal city in southern China, enjoying fame and recognition.
TR_081	6	He was released the following April, but because he refused to give up practicing Falun Gong, the authorities transferred him to another brainwashing center.
TR_081	7	Because he still maintained his faith, he was sent back to the labor camp where he had been for two years.
TR_081	8	According to Minghui.org, other Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned at the same time as Zheng remember her as a beautiful and elegant woman with a soft temperament.
TR_081	9	Yet this talented artist was humiliated and brutally tortured in the camp where he was held.
TR_081	10	When Ms. Zheng continued to refuse to stop practicing Falun Gong, she was separated from the others to be subjected to more severe treatment.
TR_081	11	He was constantly monitored and deprived of sleep.
TR_081	12	She was kept in solitary confinement, not allowed to bathe and beaten with high heels. In 2003, she was interviewed by the media after her husband won first prize in an international creative design competition.
TR_081	13	He had the opportunity to defend Zheng's freedom.
TR_081	14	He told reporters that his health was deteriorating and that he needed his wife to take care of him.
TR_081	15	Soon after, in April 2004, Zheng was released before the end of his detention period.
TR_081	16	NO PEACE
TR_081	17	But Zheng's problems were not over.
TR_081	18	Following their release, the couple was kept under police surveillance for 24 hours.
TR_081	19	They could not appear on television and were not allowed to appear in newspapers.
TR_081	20	They could not leave the country.
TR_081	21	Zheng was not allowed to travel to organize exhibitions or do other things and his phone was confiscated.
TR_081	22	Deprived of the freedom to express himself and unable to pursue his artistic life as he wished, he felt incredible mental pressure and fell into a severe depression.
TR_081	23	Her mother, Yang Huanying, a Falun Gong practitioner, has been frequently arrested.
TR_081	24	This caused Zheng even more pain.
TR_081	25	His health declined rapidly. In 2011, a new wave of arrests, mostly of local practitioners he knew well, greatly increased his suffering.
TR_081	26	His health continued to deteriorate and he died in 2012 at the age of 45.
TR_081	27	Zheng's Mother's Distress.
TR_081	28	Zheng's mother was also subjected to a hellish life due to the persecution campaign.
TR_081	29	Between September 2000 and September 2003, Yang was detained in brainwashing facilities, drug rehabilitation centers and detention centers for periods ranging from two weeks to a year. In March 2005, he was sentenced to 18 months of forced labor.
TR_081	30	For five months he was forced to watch slanderous videos about Falun Gong.
TR_081	31	He was deprived of sleep and made to stand under the scorching sun for three hours.
TR_081	32	A year after his release, Yang was arrested again and sentenced to 18 months of illegal forced labor in May 2007.
TR_081	33	He was watched by drug-addicted prisoners who cursed him.
TR_081	34	When he refused to renounce his faith, he was forced to stand for long hours.
TR_081	35	Her legs swelled and she lost a lot of weight.
TR_081	36	He could not take care of himself and had to be carried to the toilet.
TR_081	37	After Yang was released in October 2008 and regained his health, he fled his home to avoid re-arrest.
TR_081	38	In 2015, on the third anniversary of her daughter's death, Yang sued Jiang Zemin, former Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, for initiating the persecution campaign in 1999 that led to the suffering of Falun Gong practitioners and their families.
TR_081	39	Yang said the persecution caused her to lose her daughter.
TR_081	40	"In the complaint letter; ""I had a happy family."
TR_081	41	-a loving husband and four children who treat me well.

TR_083	1	President Erdogan inaugurates Tekirdağ City Hospital
TR_083	2	President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made statements at the Opening Ceremony of İsmail Fehmi Cumalıoğlu City Hospital in Tekirdağ.
TR_083	3	Speaking at the ceremony, President Erdoğan stated that today was his fifth visit to Tekirdağ and reminded that he had previously visited the city on different occasions when he was Prime Minister.
TR_083	4	Emphasizing that they have realized what they promised in the election squares one by one when they took office, President Erdoğan said that they have personally followed Tekirdağ's projects and solved its problems and problems.
TR_083	5	"President Erdoğan's statements are as follows: ""There were those who attributed the successes we achieved during our 18 years in power to coal, pasta and a bag of rice."
TR_083	6	Those who could not receive the favor of the nation, those who could not be appreciated by the nation tried to console themselves by insulting the nation.
TR_083	7	Instead of laboring, striving and producing, they thought it was a marvel to throw mud at those who work, produce and deliver services.
TR_083	8	Instead of understanding the nation, instead of sharing the nation's problems, they preferred to indoctrinate the nation from their mansions in Ankara and their columns in newspapers.
TR_083	9	İsmail Fehmi Cumalıoğlu Tekirdağ City Hospital, which we have officially opened or are opening today, is a work that will be a source of pride for our city in every respect.
TR_083	10	So, who is this Ismail Fehmi Cumalioglu?
TR_083	11	Our brother Fehmi was born in 1912, born in Hayrabolu, Tekirdağ.
TR_083	12	He is also a doctor, but he is also a politician.
TR_083	13	And he is a valuable elder and older brother whom we know very well in politics.
TR_083	14	While I was on my way by helicopter, Mr. Mustafa, the Speaker of the Assembly, said; Mr. Fehmi is from here, he is also a doctor.
TR_083	15	Of course, he was a brother who had been the Minister of Labor and who had been at the highest levels of our party at that time.
TR_083	16	We said; what do we think, it is such a beautiful work that will suit this place and immortalize our brother Fehmi.
TR_083	17	"A great state is a state that can stand by its citizens in difficult times,"" President Erdoğan said, referring to the investments made by Turkey during the pandemic."
TR_083	18	"Explaining that it has been revealed how countries that look rich on paper are inadequate in terms of hospital capacity, number of health personnel and health systems, President Erdoğan continued his words as follows: ""We have a very serious health army and a very serious war was fought with this health army during this process."
TR_083	19	And of course, there have been deaths and martyrs in our health army, may God have mercy on them and may their places be in heaven.
TR_083	20	And they fought all these infectious struggles tirelessly, they did not hesitate.
TR_083	21	And they fought this struggle, this war openly and clearly, and they are still fighting it, and it is not an easy task.
TR_083	22	And that is the beauty of this profession, that is the charm of this profession.
TR_083	23	I believe that some undignified and ill-mannered attacks against our health personnel in some places are a sign of their unappreciation.
TR_083	24	They will pay the price in this world and in the eternal world.
TR_083	25	Throughout this whole process, we have witnessed some really worrying images on behalf of humanity.
TR_083	26	We have encountered situations where people have died of indifference in the world, where health workers cannot even find masks, and where we have seen heartbreaking images from nursing homes for the elderly.
TR_083	27	Turkey has attracted attention during the pandemic with its strong health infrastructure and general health insurance system.
TR_083	28	"Stating that every citizen has a great responsibility in the fight against the pandemic, President Erdoğan said: ""The first and most important condition of the fight against the pandemic is not to catch the virus, not to catch the disease."
TR_083	29	For this, it is essential to follow the rules of cleanliness, masks and distance, which we sloganize as TMM.
TR_083	30	I call on all citizens to respect the rules for their own health and the health of their loved ones.
TR_083	31	Let us not forget that following these rules is both our human and civic duty.
TR_083	32	Only by strictly following these rules can we repay our debt of gratitude to our medical staff who have been working hard for nearly 9 months.
TR_083	33	"I believe that our nation will show the necessary sensitivity on this issue."""
TR_083	34	President Erdoğan wished the inauguration of İsmail Fehmi Cumalıoğlu Tekirdağ City Hospital to be auspicious and thanked those who contributed to bringing this work to Turkey and Tekirdağ.
TR_083	35	After his speech, President Erdoğan cut the opening ribbon with Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca, Minister of Industry and Technology Mustafa Varank, AK Party Izmir MP Binali Yıldırım, Tekirdağ Metropolitan Mayor Kadir Albayrak and relatives of İsmail Fehmi Cumalıoğlu, for whom the hospital is named.
TR_085	1	Remarks by Ömer Çelik after the AK Party FMC Meeting
TR_085	2	AK Party Spokesperson Ömer Çelik made important statements after the FMC Meeting.
TR_085	3	"Ömer Çelik's statements are as follows: ""Our President will attend our provincial congresses in Şırnak on October 18, Kayseri on October 24 and Malatya on October 25."
TR_085	4	We wish our congress process to be auspicious.
TR_085	5	The fondness of mothers for their children cannot be explained in any way with any words.
TR_085	6	We have a saying in our own language that there is no land like Baghdad.
TR_085	7	Diyarbakır mothers continue this difficult struggle to be reunited with their children. For 407 days, the families in front of the HDP have not left the vigil of conscience.
TR_085	8	The number of families reunited with their children rose to 18.
TR_085	9	No one should remain silent at the son's vigil here.
TR_085	10	The forest fire in Hatay has saddened us all.
TR_085	11	Unfortunately, we face forest fires very intensely during the summer months in Turkey.
TR_085	12	Here, of course, the fact that a PKK group is trying to make propaganda and expressing joy over the suffering here in a despicable way is undoubtedly a situation that should be condemned.
TR_085	13	It has also been observed that some politicians first show sensitivity, tweet and then delete their tweets.
TR_085	14	The authorities have been following the case from day one.
TR_085	15	It was previously revealed that they had attempted to set forest fires in various parts of Turkey.
TR_085	16	However, the investigation is ongoing and after it is over, it will be revealed how the fire started here.
TR_085	17	The sabotage investigation is ongoing.
TR_085	18	We will inform you when we have conclusive findings.
TR_085	19	The PKK's only ideology is hostility to Turkey.
TR_085	20	As we have condemned Armenia's ugly and unjustified aggression against Azerbaijan from the issue between Azerbaijan and Armenia before, I can say that we follow it day by day, even hour by hour.
TR_085	21	When there was a ceasefire, the Armenian side broke it by dropping bombs on Ganja.
TR_085	22	Those who were silent when Armenia attacked, when there was no issue, or who only said 'we are concerned about the escalation of tensions, we advise restraint to the parties', are constantly calling for a ceasefire when Azerbaijan starts to strongly claim its territory.
TR_085	23	The Pashinyan administration behaves like a rogue state.
TR_085	24	There is lawlessness, there is aggression, there are civilian casualties, there is an attack on all kinds of legitimate values.
TR_085	25	The Minsk Group is trying to put Azerbaijan and Armenia on equal footing, but there are no two equal footings here.
TR_085	26	We once again announce that we will support any decision taken by the Azerbaijani government against this aggression of Armenia.
TR_085	27	We stand by Azerbaijan and we will continue to stand by them in the future.
TR_085	28	We strongly support Azerbaijan.
TR_085	29	After the return of the Oruç Reis ship to duty after being taken into maintenance in the Eastern Mediterranean, statements are coming one after another.
TR_085	30	Can there be such unlawful, absurd statements?
TR_085	31	Look at the statements of different countries, as if each one was written by the Greek Foreign Ministry.

TR_088	1	Banned Social Media Platforms in China
TR_088	2	Since the 1990s, the use of internet has become widespread in the world with the introduction of web2.0 based systems.
TR_088	3	Thanks to this system, which enables people to interact with each other via audio and video, the whole world has started to be aware of each other.
TR_088	4	"The Internet has created a new communication environment called ""new media""."
TR_088	5	Moving from a passive to an active position, users communicate with the world by producing content on virtual communication platforms such as social media, news sites and blogs, independent of time and space.
TR_088	6	The differences in the political, economic and technological situation of countries also show differences in the use of new media by their users.
TR_088	7	Social media platforms, which are used in many countries around the world today, are not used in some countries.
TR_088	8	Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube are banned in some countries.
TR_088	9	North Korea, Iran and China are among these countries.
TR_088	10	In the People's Republic of China, ruled by the Communist Party of China, new media is driven by the ruling CCP.
TR_088	11	Despite bans and censorship on internet use in China, internet usage is quite high.
TR_088	12	This is because the CCP has developed its own alternative social media platforms to replace the widely used social media platforms such as Google, Twitter, Facebook and Youtube.
TR_088	13	The reason why China does not use these outsourced social media platforms is that the servers are located outside China and are out of China's control.
TR_088	14	In other words, the CCP has banned the use of social networks whose source is outside China and which it cannot control. As of 2018, there are approximately 1 billion internet users in China, with a population of 1.4 billion.
TR_088	15	A study on New Media Practices in the People's Republic of China has yielded some interesting results.
TR_088	16	According to the research conducted by Bozok University Faculty of Communication, the Chinese media, which is under the control and pressure of the Chinese Communist Party in terms of freedom of expression and press freedom, as well as social media, are closed to the outside world.
TR_088	17	The Chinese equivalents of some of the world's most widely used social media platforms are as follows: Google - Baidu, Twitter - Immomo or Weibo, Youtube-Youko, Facebook-RenRen, Watsapp-QQ, Wikipedia- Baidubedia.
TR_088	18	The CCP has also closed the Chinese market to foreign companies, with bans imposed to protect national security, silence dissenting voices and control the population.
TR_088	19	The world's biggest companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube could not enter the Chinese market.
TR_088	20	Although Google maps was open in the early days, it too was blocked after Taiwan was recognized as an independent country.
TR_088	21	This is because although Taiwan is an independent country, it is seen by China as a dependent country of China.
TR_088	22	In the research, it is stated that despite all these bans, people living in the country mostly use Chinese social networks, but they also use Google through virtual private networks such as VPN.
TR_088	23	When these are detected, a number of legal penalties are applied.
TR_088	24	Looking at these and similar surveys, it leaves a question mark on how much the people living in China are aware of what is happening in the world.

TR_093	4	This special day, which was declared Youth and Sports Day, was celebrated for the first time in Samsun in 1926 under the name Gazi Day, and became official in 1935 under the name Atatürk Day.

TR_093	7	For this reason, the journey starting from Istanbul on May 16-19, 1919 symbolizes liberation.

TR_093	11	In response, Lieutenant Hamdi of the Turkish Machine Gun Company took the soldiers and went up the mountain.

TR_093	15	There were British occupation forces in the city.
TR_093	16	The people were not in a position to protect themselves.
TR_093	17	The sleepless nights spent on the road were now to continue. May 19, 1919 was the beginning of the process that began with these steps taken by Atatürk and led to the Republic of Turkey.
TR_093	18	"""When I saw Samsun and the people of Samsun, I once again strongly believed that all my thoughts and decisions concerning the country and the nation could be fulfilled."
TR_093	19	"The patriotism and sacrifice that I read in the eyes of the people of Samsun, which I saw in their state and situation, was enough to lead my hopes and imaginations to a positive belief."""

TR_093	33	If today the West is finally showing technical superiority... O Turkish child!
TR_093	34	And that crime is not yours, but the result of the unforgivable negligence of those who came before you.
TR_093	35	And let me tell you, you're very smart!
TR_093	36	That's obvious, but forget your intelligence!
TR_093	37	Always be hardworking!

TR_098	1	President Erdoğan 18.
TR_098	2	President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made statements at the 18th MÜSİAD EXPO Fair held at TÜYAP Fair and Congress Center.
TR_098	3	He made statements at the MUSIAD EXPO Fair.
TR_098	4	"Stating that they are trying both to protect the health of the nation and to ensure that production and employment run without interruption in Turkey, President Erdoğan said: ""I believe that we can succeed in both of these together and come out of the pandemic process stronger."
TR_098	5	"This is the reason why such a big organization was organized in such a difficult period and why we personally participated in it."""
TR_098	6	"Erdoğan continued his words as follows: ""We have a relatively better outlook at a time when the second wave of the pandemic is sweeping the whole world."
TR_098	7	On the economic side, we are trying to reduce and share the problems caused by the pandemic with support for all segments.
TR_098	8	As the state, we keep production, exports, trade and employment alive by mobilizing all means.
TR_098	9	With this understanding, we reached out to all segments of the society, from our business world to our tradesmen, from our workers to our citizens in need of assistance, and transferred resources.
TR_098	10	I was pleased to see that MÜSİAD has established similar solidarity mechanisms among its members through the Karz-ı Hasen fund.
TR_098	11	We can reach our goals by overcoming both the problems caused by the pandemic and the problems faced by our economy with the cooperation and solidarity we will put forward together with 83 million people.
TR_098	12	"We are in preparations that will both strengthen our economic policies, raise the bar of our democracy and freedoms, and lead to relief in the daily life of our nation."" President Erdoğan continued his speech as follows: ""We have repeatedly amended our Constitution with a democratic and libertarian approach."
TR_098	13	We have rolled up our sleeves to make a completely new constitution.
TR_098	14	However, due to the Republican People's Party's spoilsport, we could not reach a result.
TR_098	15	It turned out that those who ran away from drafting a new constitution with us were later involved in other endeavors in dark corners.
TR_098	16	Thus, it became clear why the work on the new constitution that we had initiated had failed.
TR_098	17	In addition, we strengthened the infrastructure and human resources of our justice system by renewing all fundamental laws and facilitated access to law in our country.
TR_098	18	We strengthened our national unity and solidarity by expanding the areas of rights and freedoms as much as possible.
TR_098	19	We have realized many reforms in the field of economy and improved the macroeconomic outlook of our country.
TR_098	20	In short, we have never stopped reforms.
TR_098	21	Now we are preparing for new reforms and new breakthroughs.
TR_098	22	We are determined to lead our country into a new period of ascendancy in the economy and democracy.
TR_098	23	Preparations for new judicial packages are underway.
TR_098	24	We will bring these to the agenda of the Parliament as soon as possible.
TR_098	25	"We take our steps with the awareness that trust and stability are the keystones of this process,"" President Erdoğan said: ""We are creating an investment climate where everyone who trusts Turkey will win."
TR_098	26	We will take all the steps needed for this and raise the business and investment environment to the expected level.
TR_098	27	In this context, especially our organizations, which are the main actors of production and exports, have very important duties.
TR_098	28	We expect the Ministry of Trade, the Foreign Economic Relations Board, the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey, MUSIAD, TUSIAD and other organizations representing business people to work closely, efficiently and sincerely.
TR_098	29	We see our institutions, especially those involved in export processes, as complementary rather than competitors.
TR_098	30	The more closely these structures work and cooperate with each other, both inside and outside the country, the faster we will achieve our common goals.
TR_098	31	We are ready to walk this path together with everyone who believes in Turkey's strength, potential and future.
TR_098	32	We will support every step that can turn the change in the global economy in our favor.
TR_098	33	We have stood and will continue to stand by everyone who takes action for investment, production, export and employment.
TR_098	34	"We will increase our production and export capacity with new investments by using the existing opportunities at a higher level, and we will ensure the transition to high technology at every stage from design to manufacturing, and hopefully we will make this process a success."""
TR_107	1	"""Politics in Turkey changed after us."""
TR_107	2	"Source: Good Party official website ""We are a party that has survived many difficulties, obstructions, slander and attacks and has entered its third election."" IYI Party Chairperson Meral Akşener made a speech at the opening of the Election Coordination Center of MP Candidate Koray Aydın (SKM) in Mamak, Ankara."
TR_107	3	"Making statements to the press members here, Akşener said: ""We are a newly founded party. We are a party that has survived many difficulties, obstructions, slander and attacks in 2017 and has survived by resisting them, and is entering its third election."
TR_107	4	The founding of our party is recent, but there is a long history of political struggle, from the members to the executives to the chairman of this party.
TR_107	5	The greatest feature of this party is that it is a space where every member, every volunteer, including me, has a stake.
TR_107	6	"A share I have is the same as a brother who is a member in any district of Ankara."""
TR_107	7	"""Therefore, the IYI Party is a party that applies democracy within itself, learns from the mistakes that occur from time to time, does not repeat those mistakes based on those lessons and is an organization that learns."
TR_107	8	Everything changed with the establishment of the IYI Party. If we had not entered the elections in 2018, the majority of the AK Party and its stakeholders in the Parliament would not have ended.
TR_107	9	"If it wasn't for our group, the AK Party would have the majority to change the Constitution."" ""On the way to March 31st, we made an offer to the CHP."
TR_107	10	As a result, 11 metropolitan cities were taken.
TR_107	11	But most importantly, Istanbul and Ankara, so dear to Mr. Erdoğan and his friends, are gone.
TR_107	12	I sincerely believe that Koray Aydın is the father of the idea for the Millet Alliance to win these two metropolitan cities.
TR_107	13	We are the ones doing the action.
TR_107	14	So what we are talking about here is this: We are people who strategize for Turkey, who crush their ego, who give up their ego.
TR_107	15	If we had entered the March 31st elections on our own, we would have gotten X, we would have gotten Y, we would have gotten Z... But in the end, we would have weighed ourselves and seen what we were.
TR_107	16	"But neither Ankara nor Istanbul would have been taken in return."""
TR_107	17	"""What I'm trying to say is that we believed and it worked."
TR_107	18	In other words, İYİ Party is a party founded by people shaped by reason, strategy and love for Turkey.
TR_107	19	That is why politics in Turkey changed after us.
TR_107	20	That is why Recep Bey and his friends are most angry with me and members of my party.
TR_107	21	"I and my friends are slandered the most."""
TR_107	22	"""Now we come to May 14th."
TR_107	23	As the National Alliance, our presidential candidate is Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.

TR_107	27	Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu's name and picture will be in the National Alliance system.
TR_107	28	Underneath will be the logos of the CHP and the IYI Party.
TR_107	29	We are going to elections separately in the same alliance.
TR_107	30	As we say, 'One Kemal for one Meral'... You will not see my name, but you will see the sun of the IYI Party there and you will put your yes stamp on it.
TR_107	31	You will put this seal of yes around you.
TR_107	32	"We are not entering the elections under any party logo. On May 14th and until the evening of May 14th, you will tell this to every brother and sister you convince."""
TR_107	33	"""This is the last election where there will be talk of parliamentary elections."
TR_107	34	You will put the IYI Party first.
TR_107	35	Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu 13.
TR_107	36	We will elect him as President.
TR_107	37	The security and insurance of this country is the IYI Party.
TR_107	38	Each of our friends, each of our managers is a symbol of success.
TR_107	39	If we want these friends of mine to be more involved in the government that we will form tomorrow because we have won, if you want me to be a person with the powers of a prime minister, you will take our party to the first place.

TR_115	4	Why did the hospital do this?
TR_115	5	XiaoWei : The nucleic acid test was negative and the CT image was inconclusive.
TR_115	6	XiaoWei: On January 11th, I thought this disease was as serious and contagious as SARS.
TR_115	7	I said that people in Wuhan could be banned from leaving the city and become persona non grata.

TR_115	13	But on the night of January 18, after going to a bar, I didn't feel well.
TR_115	14	I was nauseous, weak and out of breath. On January 20, I had a low fever on the bus.
TR_115	15	I felt the fever on the left side of my forehead, but not on the right side.
TR_115	16	I felt strange and tested my forehead with my hand for a long time.
TR_115	17	After I got off the bus, my fever went away.
TR_115	18	But I was short of breath and felt tightness in my chest.
TR_115	19	He didn't look serious.
TR_115	20	Interviewer: What do people like you think when you are in this situation?
TR_115	21	Your symptoms have been ignored by community doctors.
TR_115	22	XiaoWei: I told others about my symptoms, no fever, no cough.
TR_115	23	People said it was not the same infection.
TR_115	24	I told my family that I was infected but none of them believed me.
TR_115	25	Correspondent: I see your medication.
TR_115	26	Was it prescribed by a doctor or did you just take it yourself?
TR_115	27	XiaoWei: I bought it myself.
TR_115	28	No doctor prescribed anything.
TR_115	29	I searched the internet and bought what was recommended.
TR_115	30	I had constant and severe watery diarrhea every day.
TR_115	31	I went to the bathroom more than 10 times on the 23rd.
TR_115	32	I also lost my appetite and had a dry and bitter taste in my mouth.

TR_115	36	Correspondent: We were told that all patients were released from temporary local hospitals.

TR_115	55	Before I started taking the medicine, it was really hard to fall asleep.
TR_115	56	It's really painful.
TR_115	57	Correspondent: People focus on patients with serious symptoms.
TR_115	58	Those of you with mild symptoms will not be treated or tested.

TR_115	61	XiaoWei: Our symptoms started with constant belching and gas, so abdominal bloating followed by gas in the stomach.
TR_115	62	As for the Henan girl, she spent about 10,000 yuan ($1414.77) in Shanghai.
TR_115	63	He wanted a diagnosis, but the hospital would not test him.
TR_115	64	In order to get a test result, she had to be admitted to hospital and pay for it.
TR_115	65	The cost at the hospital is about 1,000 yuan ($121.47) per day. After spending 3,000-4000 yuan ($424.41-565.88), the hospital still hasn't done a nucleic acid test or diagnosed her.

TR_117	1	Trump Meets with Falun Gong Practitioner Survivor of Chinese Persecution
TR_117	2	WASHINGTON - Falun Gong practitioner Yuhua Zhang, persecuted for her faith in China, was among 27 survivors of persecution for their faith who met with US President Donald Trump in Washington on July 17.
TR_117	3	Before fleeing to the US in 2015, 59-year-old Yuhua Zhang had been repeatedly imprisoned and persecuted in China, for a total of 7.5 years, for refusing to renounce her faith.
TR_117	4	The Falun Dafa Information Center has repeatedly claimed that hundreds of thousands of followers of Falun Gong, a meditation practice, are being held in prisons, labour camps and brainwashing centres, where the vast majority are being persecuted into renouncing their beliefs.
TR_117	5	The White House said President Trump met with Ms. Zhang and four others who have been persecuted in China, including a Tibetan, a Uighur Turk, and a Christian, as well as religious persecutors from 17 countries, including North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, and Burma, to reaffirm his administration's commitment to religious freedom.
TR_117	6	Ms. Zhang's attendance at this event marked the first time that a Falun Gong practitioner had met with the highest-ranking official of the US nation in an official meeting.
TR_117	7	As they gathered around President Trump in the Oval Office, Ms. Zhang told President Trump that her husband, a Falun Gong practitioner, was still being held in Suzhou prison in Jiangzu province.
TR_117	8	"""Forced organ harvesting is still going on, so we must take action,"" Ms. Zhang told President Trump, adding, ""Words are useless."""
TR_117	9	Ms. Zhang also told Trump about another practitioner who was imprisoned in the same place and died the day after his release.
TR_117	10	He added that this practitioner vomited a lot of blood before he died.
TR_117	11	"During the meeting, President Trump said, ""All of you have suffered quite severely because of your faith."""
TR_117	12	"""Each of you has now witnessed the importance of promoting religious freedom around the world,"" President Trump said."
TR_117	13	"US Ambassador Sam Brownwick, the US Ambassador to the International Freedom for All Faiths, announced that the US administration will announce ""additional measures"" to its efforts on religious freedom at a conference on July 18."
TR_117	14	Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence will address this topic in their speeches at the event.
TR_117	15	Persecuted persons were in Washington, D.C. to participate in the Resolution to Promote Religious Freedom event hosted by the U.S. State Department. The three-day conference, held from July 16-18, is the most comprehensive event on religious freedom in the world.

TR_117	17	Yuhua Zhang delivers a speech at the conference on the Decision to Promote Religious Freedom at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 17, 2019.
TR_117	18	(Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times) The Quest for Justice.
TR_117	19	Ms. Zhang, formerly a professor at Nanjing University, told the conference on July 17 that she had been subjected to severe torture during her detention in China.
TR_117	20	He added that the torture included electric shocks, sleep deprivation, forced injections of unknown drugs and running for hours in the scorching sun.
TR_117	21	Ms. Zhang's husband, Zhengyu Ma, an engineer, is currently serving a three-year sentence in Suzhou prison for sending a letter to the regime's top leaders urging them to end the persecution.
TR_117	22	Ms. Zhang has not heard from her husband since 2017.
TR_117	23	"""I think about my husband every day and every night,"" Ms. Zhang said at the conference, fearing that her husband may have been tortured to death like thousands of Falun Gong practitioners."
TR_117	24	She worries that many Falun Gong practitioners, whose numbers are currently unknown, may have been killed for their organs.
TR_117	25	Ms. Zhang reiterated in her speech that, based on evidence from various sources, it has long been alleged that the Chinese regime has been killing imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners for organ transplants.
TR_117	26	These claims were confirmed in a report published in 2006 by independent researchers David Matas and David Kilgour, who argued that this was happening on a much larger scale than previously thought.
TR_117	27	"Last month, after a year-long investigation, an independent court confirmed allegations that forced organ harvesting is taking place on a ""serious scale"" in China."
TR_117	28	The resolution stated that Falun Gong practitioners are the main source of organ transplants.
TR_117	29	"Ms. Zhang, who has worked tirelessly for her husband's release since arriving in the U.S., called on the U.S. government to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act on Chinese officials who ""carried out illegal arrests, torture and killings of Falun Gong practitioners."""
TR_117	30	"Ms. Zhang also said, ""Many of the people involved are still serving in China, and many have been promoted for supporting the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners."""
TR_117	31	"""I believe that the U.S. government, international media and human rights groups can help free my husband and hundreds of thousands of other innocent Falun Gong practitioners who are imprisoned,"" she concluded."

TR_121	1	How does the Wood Wide Web work?
TR_121	2	The forest is a social environment for trees.
TR_121	3	Trees are also social beings.
TR_121	4	There are trees that help each other.
TR_121	5	Trees spread their roots underground with fine fibers to find moist ground in the soil.
TR_121	6	In the process, they mate with fungi.
TR_121	7	Trees that are close to each other communicate through their roots and branches.
TR_121	8	But fungi play an important role in the communication of trees that are not close to each other.
TR_121	9	Mushrooms can easily penetrate into the soil with their reticulated structure.
TR_121	10	Trees also send signals to each other through fungal networks in their roots.
TR_121	11	Even in rainy, stormy weather, they send news in this way, albeit slowly, regardless of the weather.
TR_121	12	They have a very slow electrical speed of 1 cm per second.
TR_121	13	Mushrooms work just like a fiber optic internet network.
TR_121	14	With their thread-like structure, they move easily deep into the soil.
TR_121	15	A single mushroom can bind an entire forest together.
TR_121	16	These fungal networks are like a forest internetwork.
TR_121	17	(Wood wide web forest internet network) Trees that lose this communication network often get sick.
TR_121	18	Fungi are living things that fall between animals and plants.
TR_121	19	The cell structure of fungi sets them apart from plants.
TR_121	20	They have cell walls called chitin, which plants lack.
TR_121	21	This makes them closer to pests.
TR_121	22	Fungi do not photosynthesize like plants.
TR_121	23	Fungi owe their existence to the organic bonds they form with other living things.
TR_121	24	Fungi can spread over large areas with their underground cottony webs called suckers.
TR_121	25	In Switzerland, there is a thousand-year-old honey fungus spread over an area half a kilometer wide.
TR_121	26	Another mushroom in Oregon is estimated to be 2400 years old and is said to weigh 600 kg, covering an area of 9 square kilometers.
TR_121	27	According to this, fungi are the largest living organisms in the world.
TR_121	28	Fungi are not always friendly to trees.
TR_121	29	They search the forest for edible tissue and kill trees.
TR_121	30	Fungi are living things between animals and plants.
TR_121	31	Every tree has to expand its roots to get food and water from the soil.
TR_121	32	For this, each tree works with the most suitable mushroom species.
TR_121	33	There are plants that can spread without the need for a fungus, but fungus-powered trees can take up more nitrogen and phosphorus.
TR_121	34	For example, the oak tree works with oak cork.
TR_121	35	The fungi attach to the hairs on the roots of the tree and spread where they are found.
TR_121	36	From there it can spread to other trees.
TR_121	37	It partners with the corky structures of other trees, thus forming a corky network.
TR_121	38	It is through this network that trees are able to share food among themselves or receive information about pest attacks.
TR_121	39	If they cannot find food, they die.
TR_121	40	They ask trees for a third of the sugar the tree has in exchange for their services.
TR_121	41	Fungi can help trees by attracting heavy metals from them.
TR_121	42	They remove some harmful bacteria.
TR_121	43	Air pollution could spell the end of mushrooms.
TR_121	44	Some trees of different species compete with each other, while others feed each other.
TR_121	45	Beech trees, for example, are said to be able to be friends with others.
TR_121	46	Trees don't want to lose their friends.
TR_121	47	This is because the disturbance of gaps in the forest affects the air humidity balance.
TR_121	48	Especially trees grown for commercial use need plenty of space.
TR_121	49	These trees should get a lot of sun, photosynthesize and grow quickly.
TR_121	50	When trees are too close together, they can interfere with each other's use of sun and water. pixabay.
TR_121	51	Vanessa Burche, a student at the University of St. Achen, discovered that beech trees help each other even when they are in different places.
TR_121	52	The tree with more sugar gives it to the tree with less through its roots.
TR_121	53	The strong help the weak and make each other equal.
TR_121	54	Beech trees communicate through fungi and carry out a kind of social cooperation.
TR_121	55	Usually foresters cut them down because they think that trees should not be too close to each other.
TR_121	56	But a beech forest in Lübeck, northern Germany, with dense stands of trees, yielded too much.
TR_121	57	The trees fed each other better when they were close to each other.
TR_121	58	It is also difficult for trees to defend against insects in places with spaced trees.
TR_121	59	This runs counter to the evolutionary theory of survival of the fittest.
TR_121	60	Because the health of trees depends on them being together.
TR_121	61	When the unhealthy and frail ones disappear, gaps appear in the forest and are vulnerable to the weather.
TR_121	62	The heat and sun pierce the soil of the forest and disrupt the humid cool climate.
TR_121	63	Even seemingly strong trees get sick from time to time.
TR_121	64	If there are no other trees nearby, even a light insect attack can shorten their lifespan.

TR_124	1	After Meeting the Son of Pro-Democracy Zhao Ziyang
TR_124	2	Comment.
TR_124	3	By Gobi East, January 17 was the 16th anniversary of the death of former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Zhao Ziyang.
TR_124	4	Zhao Ziyang stood with the people in the 1989 democratic protest movement.
TR_124	5	As a result, Zhao was expelled from the Party, but became a symbol of democracy.
TR_124	6	Zhao, who was general secretary of the CCP at the time of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, was under house arrest in Beijing until his death on January 17, 2005.
TR_124	7	The Chinese regime has since banned all media from reporting on Zhao.
TR_124	8	My problem with the Chinese authorities began in 2009 after a brief encounter with Zhao Erjun, the second child of Zhao Ziyang.
TR_124	9	During the Spring Festival, I was visiting my friend Shi Lei in Guangzhou.
TR_124	10	I recently found an old photo of the three of us.
TR_124	11	I never imagined that the Chinese authorities would sentence me to 10 years of detention for attending this meeting, even though I did not know Zhao Ziyang personally.
TR_124	12	The day after I returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou, I was contacted by Chen Youwu, an officer of the Political Security Department of the Shanghai police bureau.
TR_124	13	Since then, I have been blacklisted by the CCP Ministry of Public Security for 10 years.
TR_124	14	My friend Shi died in 2010.
TR_124	15	He was a retired commander who had run a small airport in the Air Force.
TR_124	16	Since the cause of death is unknown and mysteriously hidden, I suspect that my friend may have kept some secrets from me.
TR_124	17	But I'm sure he was murdered.
TR_124	18	Since then, many things have happened to me that seem surreal.
TR_124	19	But one thing is certain: The CCP is keeping a very close eye on the Zhao family and those who are directly or indirectly involved with them.
TR_124	20	When I returned to Guangzhou again, I was persecuted and harassed by the Chinese authorities.
TR_124	21	I stayed at a friend's house.
TR_124	22	"They even killed my friend's guard dog, and to keep me away they sent a group of old men every day to sing patriotic ""red"" songs in front of the house."
TR_124	23	When it comes to surveillance, Shanghai (its police) is the most ruthless and Guangzhou the most shameless.
TR_124	24	In Shanghai, people were sent to watch me all the time and they harassed me personally from time to time; in Guangzhou, all kinds of despicable methods were used that I find it difficult to describe. For the five years before 2009, I worked hard to have a good life and I succeeded.
TR_124	25	I thought I could live in China for the rest of my life.
TR_124	26	But then I was imprisoned for seven years for political dissent.
TR_124	27	Later, I was spied on by Chinese authorities and even had my house searched.
TR_124	28	Then in 2018 I was forced to leave the country, leaving everything behind.
TR_124	29	All this happened to me because I live in a country ruled by the worst regime in the world.
TR_124	30	I ran away to New York.
TR_124	31	During my time there, I wanted to work as a campaign assistant for a local congressman.
TR_124	32	But someone tried to persuade me to abandon my anti-communist stance on the grounds that I would offend pro-communist groups in the state.
TR_124	33	But this person could not convince me.
TR_124	34	I told him that the CCP had taken the best years of my life in China.
TR_124	35	I can let go of my hatred for the CCP, but I will never compromise with such an evil regime.
TR_124	36	Recently, I was saddened to come across a post on Twitter claiming that the Chinese people are satisfied with the CCP.
TR_124	37	"The comment was written in response to former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tweet in which he called the CCP a ""real threat"" to the US."
TR_124	38	I replied to the Twitter user and told him that if he really wanted to know the truth about the CCP, he should ask the tens of millions of Chinese people who have been killed and persecuted for their beliefs, Falun Gong practitioners, whose organs have been forcibly removed, Falun Gong practitioners, a spiritual practice, and dissidents who have been exiled.
TR_124	39	Many families were torn apart as a result of the CCP's persecution.
TR_124	40	I realized that the communist ghost had infiltrated the United States and that the current environment was beginning to remind me of my time in China.
TR_124	41	I believed that the US was a country of freedom and democracy and I thought I would live a normal life here.
TR_124	42	The American people are in danger of losing freedom and democracy.
TR_124	43	When I look at the old photo with Zhao Erjun, it brings back painful memories.
TR_124	44	But one thing is for sure: I will never stop defending justice and truth.
TR_124	45	Gobi East (pseudonym) is a pro-democracy activist who spent several years in prison in mainland China for political dissent. Although he escaped from China in 2018 and traveled to the United States, he continues to be persecuted and monitored by the Chinese regime.

TR_144	2	"ISTANBUL (AA) - UĞUR ASLANHAN - Aziz Koçal, President of the Consumer Protection Association (TÜKODER), stated that consumers should seek their rights by applying to arbitration committees when they are victimized, ""70 percent of consumers who apply to these committees are justified and their victimization is eliminated."
TR_144	3	"If there is no lack of paperwork, the rate of vindication of consumers who apply to arbitration committees exceeds 80 percent."""
TR_144	4	Officials of consumer associations made statements to the AA correspondent on the occasion of World Consumer Rights Day.
TR_144	5	In his statement, Koçal said that in recent years, consumers who have become more aware have started to seek their rights more and more, and that communication opportunities, consumer organizations and consumer arbitration committees play an important role in this development.
TR_144	6	Mentioning the importance of strengthening consumer organizations working to reduce violations of rights, Koçal said that arbitration committees also play a very important role in protecting the rights of consumers.
TR_144	7	Koçal reminded that consumer arbitration committees were established to find solutions to disputes that may arise from consumer-oriented practices, and emphasized that the committees working in line with this purpose have become the door of hope for consumers who have suffered rights violations and are powerless against powerful sellers and providers.
TR_144	8	"""When the consumer is victimized, it is very important for the consumer to apply to the consumer arbitration committees, whose name has come to the fore frequently in recent years and whose decisions have the force of law."
TR_144	9	Seventy percent of consumers who apply to these committees are vindicated and their grievances are resolved.
TR_144	10	Another 30 percent face negative results either due to lack of paperwork or due to a claim error as the consumer is not fully aware of his/her rights.
TR_144	11	"In other words, if there is no lack of documents, the rate of consumers who apply to arbitration committees exceeds 80 percent."" - ""Sellers must comply with the results of the consumer arbitration committees"" Koçal noted that the results of the consumer arbitration committees are like a court and that there are criminal sanctions in case of non-compliance, and said that the way to appeal this is through the consumer courts."
TR_144	12	Koçal stated that if the seller and provider do not fulfill the decision of the arbitration committees, the consumers can directly execute the other party with the relevant decision, thus the receivable can be collected.
TR_144	13	Koçal stated that the committees to be applied in disputes between the consumer and the seller or provider vary according to the number and gave the following information:
TR_144	14	"""In the applications to be made to the consumer arbitration committees, in the provinces with metropolitan status, the district consumer arbitration committees in the district district governorships should be applied to the district consumer arbitration committees in the disputes with a value below 5 thousand 650 liras, and the provincial consumer arbitration committees should be applied to the disputes between 5 thousand 650 liras and 8 thousand 480 liras."
TR_144	15	"In the centers of the provinces that do not have metropolitan status and in the affiliated districts, applications should be made to the provincial consumer arbitration committees in disputes under 8 thousand 480 liras."""
TR_144	16	Koçal said that it is important for citizens to apply to consumer arbitration committees when they are wronged and that they will most likely be vindicated.
TR_144	17	Koçal informed that applications to the consumer arbitration committees are made in the district governorship buildings in the districts and in the provincial trade directorates in the provinces, and that applications can now also be made via e-Government.

TR_151	1	Varicose veins treatment should be personalized
TR_151	2	"Cardiovascular Surgeon Op. Dr. Aybanu Gökçen said, ""Varicose vein treatment should be personalized""."
TR_151	3	Op. Dr. Aybanu Gökçen stated that varicose veins vary from person to person in terms of the structure of the vein system.
TR_151	4	Stating that the human body has an extremely unique and unique structure, Op.
TR_151	5	Dr.
TR_151	6	"Gökçen said, ""Problems with the human venous system are a slightly different situation compared to other diseases."
TR_151	7	Therefore, the venous system varies from person to person in terms of its structure and spreads in a different direction in each person, resulting in different vascular formations, tissue changes and different clinical findings.
TR_151	8	"This will naturally require personalized diagnosis and treatment."""
TR_151	9	"Dr. Aybanu Gökçen stated that personalized varicose vein treatment consists of four main processes and said the following: ""Listening to complaints, physical examination, vein mapping, treatment and follow-up."
TR_151	10	In the first stage, the patient's complaints are listened to in detail and it is determined whether they are really related to varicose veins.
TR_151	11	For example, in some patients, leg problems are caused or associated with herniated discs, neurological and orthopedic problems.
TR_151	12	The patient may have many other coexisting conditions that they are not aware of but have not yet come to light, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, thyroid diseases, allergies, rheumatic diseases, neurological or even psychiatric problems.
TR_151	13	In addition, varicose veins are not a disease, they are the most common symptom of venous hypertension (high blood pressure in the veins).
TR_151	14	This approach forms the basis of treatment planning.
TR_151	15	"It is necessary to find and eliminate not only varicose veins but also the underlying cause of high blood pressure."""
TR_151	16	"Stating that the second stage is the process of creating a ""vascular map"" of the patient, Dr."
TR_151	17	"Gökçen said, ""The causes of varicose veins can sometimes vary such as insufficiency in the valves, sometimes obstruction, sometimes compression."
TR_151	18	This is where 'doppler ultrasonography' comes into play to clarify all these unknowns.
TR_151	19	Doppler ultrasonography is an essential 'gold standard'.
TR_151	20	Each person's vasculature is unique and a detailed ultrasonographic evaluation reveals a personalized vascular map.
TR_151	21	The individualized vascular map is the roadmap for individualized treatment.
TR_151	22	The next stage is treatment planning.
TR_151	23	If the information and findings obtained in the first two phases are accurate and sufficiently detailed, they will already provide treatment options.
TR_151	24	I tell all my patients the same thing, there is not the best treatment, there is the most appropriate treatment.
TR_151	25	The most effective treatment is personalized varicose vein treatment.
TR_151	26	Sometimes more than one treatment option may be required in the same patient.
TR_151	27	These options can also be applied in the same session and sequentially.
TR_151	28	Personalized varicose vein treatment will greatly reduce the risk of recurrence of varicose veins and possibly even eliminate them completely.
TR_151	29	Our last stage in personalized varicose vein treatment is the follow-up of the patient.
TR_151	30	Again, individualized follow-up intervals are determined according to the condition of the patient and the disease.
TR_151	31	"While a simple varicose veins does not require follow-up after a single treatment session, a patient with a new clot problem will require close follow-up, and an old deep vein thrombosis (clot in deep veins) patient will require regular follow-up every year."""
TR_151	32	"""There is no disease, there is a patient."
TR_151	33	"Varicose veins require personalized diagnosis, personalized treatment and personalized follow-up,"" said Dr."
TR_151	34	"Gökçen said, ""For this reason, those with varicose veins should definitely ask their doctor to make a special treatment plan for them."""

TR_155	17	Stoltenberg said they would also increase assistance to Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
TR_155	18	Following the foreign ministers, NATO defense ministers will meet on March 16 to discuss new military measures in the Ukraine crisis and the expansion of the Response Force in the Eastern flank.
TR_155	19	"""No-fly zone"" request rejected."
TR_155	20	"Upon a question, Jens Stoltenberg stated that the issue of creating a ""no fly zone"", which Ukraine insistently demanded in order to create a humanitarian aid corridor, was also discussed at the meeting and said, ""This issue was on the agenda."
TR_155	21	"Allies consider that NATO planes should not fly in Ukrainian airspace, NATO troops should not enter Ukrainian territory,"" he said."
TR_155	22	"When asked by a Ukrainian journalist, ""How many more Ukrainians should die for the creation of this airspace?"" Stoltenberg said, ""What is happening in Ukraine now is terrible, painful, there is a danger in Europe that we have not seen since World War II."
TR_155	23	We appreciate the resistance of the Ukrainian people.
TR_155	24	And we are increasing our support.
TR_155	25	NATO allies have imposed the toughest sanctions.
TR_155	26	But we also have a responsibility as NATO to prevent this war from growing and spreading outside Ukraine.
TR_155	27	That's why NATO has said that we will not go into Ukraine, neither by air nor by land.
TR_155	28	If we create a no-fly zone, we need to monitor it, we need to shoot down Russian planes that violate it.
TR_155	29	We are aware of the desperation here.
TR_155	30	But if we shoot down Russian planes, then we will cause an all-out European war.
TR_155	31	Many more countries will go to war.
TR_155	32	"That is why we are taking this painful decision."""
TR_155	33	"Stoltenberg said Russia's attack on the nuclear power plant ""shows how dangerous and reckless this invasion is."" ""We call on Russia to withdraw all its forces from Ukraine and come to the table in good faith as soon as possible,"" he said."
TR_155	34	"""Ukrainian soldiers trained by NATO are fighting"" Stoltenberg added that NATO has been training and providing military support to the Ukrainian army for many years and said, ""Putin underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian army."
TR_155	35	The support of Zelenski and the public is boosting the army's morale.
TR_155	36	Allies, including Canada and Turkey, provided military assistance.
TR_155	37	We have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers.

TR_155	41	"In response to a question about Poland and Bulgaria's announcement that they would ""provide military fighter jets"" to Ukraine, the NATO Secretary General pointed out that ""Poland has announced that it has given up sending fighter jets""."
TR_155	42	"He emphasized that NATO aims to ""build a real deterrent force on NATO's eastern flank by becoming stronger in the long term."
TR_155	43	Stoltenberg said he did not want to elaborate on what kind of military assistance the allies were providing, but said that Ukraine was receiving very effective arms support.
TR_155	44	Stoltenberg noted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is in blatant violation of international law, that illegal weapons are being used, and that NATO is closely monitoring these developments and gathering information.
TR_155	45	Stoltenberg also expressed support for the investigation opened by the International Criminal Court against Russia and Belarus.

TR_165	1	Will KYK scholarship applications be received in October?
TR_165	2	GSB 2021-2022 student loan applications this year
TR_165	3	Within the scope of KYK scholarship and loan, students are paid 650 TL for 12 months of the year.
TR_165	4	Criteria such as the financial status of the candidates' families, the city of education, and the number of children studying play a decisive role in the evaluation process.
TR_165	5	Students whose economic needs have increased with the opening of universities have started the countdown for KYK scholarship and loan applications.
TR_165	6	Prep class and first year students who are new to the university, as well as those who receive student loans and students studying in the intermediate year will be able to apply for scholarships.
TR_165	7	Associate and undergraduate students, on the other hand, took KYK scholarship and loan application dates to their agenda.
TR_165	8	The applications will be compared with information from different government agencies to determine the students who will receive scholarships.
TR_165	9	Students who are not eligible for scholarships will be provided with repayable loans.
TR_165	10	The dates for KYK applications started to become clearer.
TR_165	11	So when are the 2021 KYK scholarship and loan applications?
TR_165	12	Here is the answer... When will 2021 KYK Scholarship Applications Start?
TR_165	13	The Ministry of Youth and Sports has not yet shared the application calendar with candidates.
TR_165	14	However, based on 2021 and the history of the past years, applications are expected to start in October.
TR_165	15	Last year, applications started in the last week of October and lasted until November.
TR_165	16	The results were announced on December 7.
TR_165	17	Scholarship Applications will be made via e-Government!
TR_165	18	In cooperation with the Credit and Dormitories Institution and the Ministry of Youth and Sports, applications for the scholarship to be given to students will be received via e-Government.
TR_165	19	Candidates will not be in a situation such as taking documents to any institution in person.
TR_165	20	"On the specified dates, students will follow the steps determined by going to the ""Scholarship / Tuition Loan Application"" process from the e-Government Gateway."
TR_165	21	Students who fill out the form for the required information will be checked against information from government agencies to see if they have made false statements and if the documents are correct.
TR_165	22	Students in need will be identified and given scholarships.
TR_165	23	How is Tuition Loan Repayment Made?
TR_165	24	"Students who receive student loans are paid starting from the month two years after the end of the normal education period without waiting for notification in the ""Scholarship / Loan Commitment Letter"" they signed at the stage of receiving loans."
TR_165	25	The debts of students who have received loans are calculated according to the amounts given as loans from the date of the loan until the end of the education period or until the date the loans are discontinued for any reason.
TR_165	26	KYK loan repayments are paid in installments from month to month, not in a lump sum.
TR_165	27	Attention, your scholarship may be cut!
TR_165	28	Students who do not meet the conditions of the scholarship allocated to students by the Credit and Dormitories Institution will have their scholarship payments discontinued.
TR_165	29	For example, when a student completes 4 years of education but extends his/her education because he/she does not fulfill the graduation requirements, his/her scholarship is terminated.
TR_165	30	Likewise, with the change introduced in 2018, the scholarship of students with a year-end average below 2.00 in the 4-grade system is cut off. In the 100-grade system, the scholarships of students with a GPA below 53.33 will be converted into loans.
TR_165	31	Students who drop out of school for any reason or are sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months or more will lose their scholarships.
TR_165	32	Here are the students who will not benefit from the scholarship;
TR_166	1	Erdogan 4 times ahead of his closest rival in the latest poll
TR_166	2	"GENAR Research Company surveyed 3 thousand people between April 28 and May 3 and asked them the question ""Who is your favorite politician?""."
TR_166	3	According to the results of the survey carried by Hürriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi; Erdoğan, who is at the top with 36.2 percent, has 4 times the difference to his closest rival.
TR_166	4	"Selvi's article on the survey is as follows: ""If you think that the coronavirus is only effective in the field of health, you are wrong."
TR_166	5	Perhaps it has had as much impact on the economy as on health.
TR_166	6	But it also shapes politics.
TR_166	7	GENAR's survey conducted with 3 thousand people between April 28 and May 3 sheds light on politics during the coronavirus days.
TR_166	8	I would like to reflect the general trend without overwhelming you with figures.
TR_166	9	"""4 TIMES DIFFERENT TO HIS CLOSEST COMPETITOR"" President Erdoğan ranks first in the survey on ""Your favorite politician""."
TR_166	10	Erdoğan ranks first with 36.2 percent, 4 times more than his closest rival.
TR_166	11	Because Turkish politics is polarized between Erdoganists and Erdogan opponents, previous polls did not show much support for Erdogan from other parties.
TR_166	12	He had a high level of support from his own audience.
TR_166	13	Partly MHP voters were also showing interest.
TR_166	14	This time there is also support from the grassroots of other parties.
TR_166	15	I would like to draw your attention especially to the HDP and Saadet Party base.
TR_166	16	ERDOGAN AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT.
TR_166	17	President Erdoğan's strong leadership in the fight against the coronavirus has put him several levels apart from other figures.
TR_166	18	Erdoğan is a leader with a very high crisis management capacity.
TR_166	19	He also manages to rally the nation around him on national issues thanks to his strong leadership.
TR_166	20	We saw this in Operation Olive Branch, Operation Peace Spring, when we sent troops abroad, and in the Jerusalem vote.
TR_166	21	Of course, it is not enough just to be strong.
TR_166	22	It is also necessary to be successful in crisis management.
TR_166	23	Think in reverse.
TR_166	24	What would happen if Turkey's health system collapsed during the pandemic?
TR_166	25	SUPPORT FOR THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.
TR_166	26	I would like to point out that Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca's score is 4.37 out of 5.
TR_166	27	There is also strong support for Fahrettin Koca from CHP, İYİ Party and HDP voters.
TR_166	28	People love those who serve.
TR_166	29	ERDOĞAN CAUGHT THE MOOD BEFORE NOVEMBER 1.
TR_166	30	I don't know if it is only related to the fight against the coronavirus, but it turns out that the AK Party's vote increased by 2.8 points compared to the June 24 elections.
TR_166	31	When the votes of the AK Party, which increased to 45.4 percent, and the MHP, which increased to 9.8 percent, are combined, the support for the 'republic alliance' climbs to 55.2 percent.
TR_166	32	One year ago there were local elections in this country, the AK Party lost Istanbul and Ankara, what has changed in one year?
TR_166	33	I asked İhsan Aktaş about this.
TR_166	34	"""CHP lost the wind it caught in the local elections,"" he said."
TR_166	35	I think that Erdoğan's successful moves after the local elections and his success in taking the wind behind his back have also played a big role in this.
TR_166	36	Erdoğan, who also has the support of other parties, seems to be above the 'republic alliance'.
TR_166	37	Erdoğan captured the mood before the November 1 elections.
TR_166	38	İMAMOĞLU AND YAVAŞ OVERTAKE KILIÇDAROĞLU.
TR_166	39	After President Erdoğan, the leader of the main opposition party, CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu would normally be expected to come second.
TR_166	40	But it's not like that.
TR_166	41	Kılıçdaroğlu used to be one or two steps behind.
TR_166	42	Now it has fallen to 8th place.
TR_166	43	Kılıçdaroğlu did not make a grave mistake in this process.
TR_166	44	That is why I called İhsan Aktaş, the President of GENAR, and asked him why.
TR_166	45	"""Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş withdrew some of Kılıçdaroğlu's points,"" he said."
TR_166	46	"Imamoğlu and Yavaş are ranked higher than Kılıçdaroğlu."""
TR_169	1	The teacher who carries and instills the spirit of Turkey!
TR_169	2	Don't be fooled by those who make sacred statements about Teachers' Day in their social media messages.
TR_169	3	Most of them are messages of good manners.
TR_169	4	Who knows this best?
TR_169	5	Unfortunately, teachers know best.
TR_169	6	In Turkey, the value of the teacher has diminished to almost nothing.
TR_169	7	I wish everything was as rosy as the congratulatory messages.
TR_169	8	A new paradigm in education is needed.
TR_169	9	It's time to make fundamental changes.
TR_169	10	A reform with the teacher at its center is essential.
TR_169	11	A system in which teachers are dissatisfied will not produce happy generations.
TR_169	12	If teachers lose hope, pessimism will not leave our doorstep.
TR_169	13	If the teacher is not full, society is not full.
TR_169	14	If a teacher is not like a teacher, a nation is not like a nation.
TR_169	15	The teacher cannot be neglected.
TR_169	16	You cannot build a new generation with what you have neglected.
TR_169	17	In no way can you achieve success and reach the goal.
TR_169	18	If the biggest problem in this country is the problem of education, the most important problem within the problem of education is the problem of teachers.
TR_169	19	Turkey's need for teachers is not a matter of quotas to be solved by making appointments in certain branches, but rather a matter of competent teachers who are well trained in every aspect and dedicated to their country.
TR_169	20	NATIONAL SPIRIT
TR_169	21	While there are many speeches about the meaning and importance of the day, I would like to emphasize that we should not miss the national spirit that the late Mahir İz, one of the rare names we can show as the ideal example of the type of teacher we need for Teachers' Day, insisted on.
TR_169	22	If we want to bring our beautiful country, which has survived many hardships, to the level of leading countries, we must first of all train teachers who believe in Turkey and feel the spirit of Turkey in their bones.
TR_169	23	In other words, we must have a national education in substance, not in word.
TR_169	24	The concept of nationality must be given its due.
TR_169	25	National education cannot benefit from educators who do not carry a national spirit.
TR_169	26	Students who will be raised by teachers who do not have an indigenous stance will not know their place in the future and will not be able to find their direction.
TR_169	27	Isn't this the fundamental problem we are facing?
TR_169	28	Whatever this land has suffered from, it has suffered from the illiterate, the illiterate who have confused their direction and misplaced their qibla.
TR_169	29	Mahir İz, whom we can show as an example to all educators, was one of the pioneering teachers who believed in the spirit of Turkey.
TR_169	30	Like his surname, he left his mark and aroused national feelings in hearts.
TR_169	31	İz describes the teacher as the man who gives his students the national spirit and excitement.
TR_169	32	"The deceased, who believed that it would be possible to rise with educators who believed in the spirit of Turkey and that the society would unite around this spirit, explains the importance of the subject in one of his memories as follows: ""Not without the National Spirit."
TR_169	33	One day I was teaching at Halıcıoğlu Military High School, there was a German teacher there.
TR_169	34	A man of German nationality, we had lunch one day, we were having coffee.
TR_169	35	He came to me and I said, 'There is no stone left on stone in Germany.
TR_169	36	All your scientists, technical men, scholars were killed.
TR_169	37	What will become of Germany?'
TR_169	38	"He drank his coffee and said, ""Mr. Mahir, yes, they killed Germany, but Germany will be the biggest industrial country in the world in 20 years."
TR_169	39	I smiled.
TR_169	40	Like in your dreams.
TR_169	41	This happened in 1945.
TR_169	42	Then 1960' the doorbell was rung.
TR_169	43	I opened it, I look like I know him.
TR_169	44	He introduced himself, I let him in, Hodja Alman.
TR_169	45	We sat, chatted, ate and drank.
TR_169	46	As he was leaving, he said, 'Mr. Mahir, I have come to settle a score.
TR_169	47	We talked like this at Halıcıoğlu Military High School and you laughed.
TR_169	48	I came today to confirm my promise.
TR_169	49	Germany is one of the largest industrialized countries in the world.
TR_169	50	Ask me, you said 20 years, he did it in 15.
TR_169	51	I also thought about the holidays, he worked during the holidays, and Germany brought forward its development by 5 years.
TR_169	52	They destroyed Germany's factories, they destroyed its scientists, they killed and killed.
TR_169	53	But they could not kill the German spirit.
TR_169	54	As long as that spirit remains, Germany cannot be killed.
TR_169	55	Our teachers have always instilled this spirit in their students.
TR_169	56	"Our resurrection was in this spirit."""
TR_169	57	As a result, it will be possible for our country to get back on its feet from where it has fallen, as the deceased stated through the example of Germany, with teachers who know what Turkey means and instill the spirit of Turkey in the new generations entrusted to them.
TR_169	58	Those who will herald our resurrection are fully idealistic teachers who do not see their own destiny as separate from the destiny of their homeland, who believe that Turkey has its own unique identity, that it cannot be understood by reason, that it cannot be comprehended with the mind, that it cannot be put on a scale or ruler, as Alev Alatlı expresses in his magnificent quote.
TR_175	1	Breaking news: Minister Kurum announced!
TR_175	2	'There will be a new technology, this is an opportunity...' , on his way to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, made some remarkable remarks to Mehmet Acet and other journalists on the plane.
TR_175	3	"On the subject of ""Climate Change"", Kurum said, ""The rate of disasters due to climate change has reached 91 percent worldwide."" Regarding Turkey's road map and targets, Kurum said, ""Turkey's impact on carbon emissions that cause global warming is 1 percent."
TR_175	4	"Our goal is to zero this emission by 2053."""
TR_175	5	"""Now the era of green development begins."
TR_175	6	There will be a new technology.
TR_175	7	"We are entering a period of green development,"" Minister Kurum said, ""We need to make good use of this opportunity..."
TR_175	8	New employment opportunities will be created.
TR_175	9	We have some advantages.
TR_175	10	Our installed capacity in renewable energy is around 53 percent.
TR_175	11	"We rank 5th in Europe and 12th in the world."""
TR_175	12	"Here is Mehmet Acet's article titled ""A new 'strategic goal' has appeared on the horizon for Ankara"": What is this goal?"
TR_175	13	We listened to Minister Murat Kurum on the way to Scotland.
TR_175	14	We were due to arrive in Scotland at the beginning of the month to watch the Climate Summit, which President Tayyip Erdoğan was expected to attend.
TR_175	15	As is well known, this trip was canceled when the Scottish authorities overruled Turkey's demands regarding security protocols, and on October 31, the plane carrying Erdoğan was diverted from Rome to Istanbul instead of Glasgow.
TR_175	16	We had already put the trip to Scotland out of our minds when, a week later, we received a new invitation.
TR_175	17	This time, at the invitation of Murat Kurum, Minister of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, we traveled to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to follow his participation in ministerial-level meetings.
TR_175	18	Some photos from the leaders' summit on climate change, which I watched from afar when I was in Ankara, were published in the press.
TR_175	19	It may be possible to interpret these photos of Joe Biden and Boris Johnson falling asleep as 'unpleasant snapshots' for the moment.
TR_175	20	However, at this rate, in a few generations' time, the children or grandchildren of these leaders will no doubt remember these photos as 'photos of shame'.
TR_175	21	Why do we say that?
TR_175	22	The issue of climate change, which is evident from those photographs, will become a very serious crisis for the world in the coming years.
TR_175	23	In fact, judging by the amount and destructiveness of floods, fires, etc., it is clear that we are already facing an alarming situation.
TR_175	24	Together with our colleagues Vahap Munyar and Nazlı Çelik, we had a long conversation with Minister Murat Kurum on the 4.5-hour drive to Edinburgh.
TR_175	25	As you know, one of the first things that Parliament did as soon as it opened in October was to adopt the Paris agreement with yes votes from all parties.
TR_175	26	Immediately afterwards, the term 'Climate Change' was added to the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization.
TR_175	27	As the Minister of Environment and Urbanization for more than three years, Kurum has literally been running day and night, taking on difficult tasks such as urban transformation, staying in disaster areas for weeks and months to heal the wounds after disasters, and he has also worked well on the newly added 'Climate Change' to the name of the ministry he leads.
TR_175	28	After this sentence, let me share some notes from the long conversation we had with him on the plane: In fact, there are two kinds of 'focus' on climate change.
TR_175	29	On one side of the issue is the fight against global warming, the catastrophic dimensions of which are becoming more and more palpable.
TR_175	30	The other pillar is to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise during this struggle and get on board the 'green development' train, the world's new route.
TR_175	31	"""OUR TARGET IS TO ZERO THIS"" Let's take a few notes from what Minister Kurum said about the first, i.e. 'threat' dimension of the issue: - The rate of climate change-related disasters worldwide has reached 91 percent."
TR_175	32	It rains in Greenland and snows in the desert.
TR_175	33	The warmest period since the industrial revolution was measured between 2015 and 2020. - The world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius.
TR_175	34	The Paris Agreement aims to limit this warming to 1.5 degrees.
TR_175	35	Since Turkey is located in the Mediterranean basin, it is among the countries that will be most affected by global warming.
TR_175	36	Turkey's warming is close to twice the world average. - Turkey's impact on carbon emissions that cause global warming is 1 percent.
TR_175	37	Our goal is to eliminate these emissions by 2053.
TR_175	38	"""A NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL COME OUT, WE NEED TO TAKE US TOWARDS THIS OPPORTUNITY"" So, what will be done within the framework of this struggle?"
TR_175	39	What kind of targets have been set?
TR_175	40	According to the information provided by the Minister Kurum, 3 billion 157 million dollars of financial resources were provided to Turkey under the Paris Agreement.
TR_175	41	Let us relay the rest through the information he provided: - Within 3 years, we have reached this agreement to spend it.
TR_175	42	We will use this resource for green development and green production. - The world experienced a technological revolution in the 90s, but we did not catch up enough.
TR_175	43	Now the era of green development begins.
TR_175	44	There will be a new technology.
TR_175	45	We are entering an era of green development. - In this period, we must be a country that leads and influences, rather than being 'exposed'.
TR_175	46	We need to make good use of this opportunity. - Projects will be prepared for all those involved in energy, agriculture, transportation, industry, forestation, environment and these funds will be spent on these projects.
TR_175	47	New areas of employment will be created. - We have some advantages.
TR_175	48	Our installed capacity in renewable energy is around 53 percent.
TR_175	49	We rank 5th in Europe and 12th in the world.
TR_175	50	Let me add this much to these words: There is a need for more public sensitization on these issues.
TR_175	51	We need to say more, we need to raise more awareness about what needs to be done.
TR_175	52	If not, we will be leaving a very bad world to future generations.
TR_176	1	Slimming down by swallowing rice: Say goodbye to your fat with the raw rice diet!
TR_176	2	We will talk about the method of slimming by swallowing rice special for those who want to reach a reasonable level in body mass value and get away from excess weight and reach the form they dream of.
TR_176	3	It is known that people who want to achieve success in their goal of losing weight and slimming have experienced the slimming technique by swallowing rice and discovered its excellent effects.
TR_176	4	Is it harmful to lose weight by swallowing rice, an alternative that fat burners apply with curiosity and excitement, and what are its features?
TR_176	5	Slimming down by swallowing rice: Say goodbye to your fat with the raw rice diet!
TR_176	6	It is an extremely savior option for people who have difficulty in controlling their appetite and who constantly want to eat as they eat during the day.
TR_176	7	If those who want to lose weight apply the method of swallowing raw rice, they will be able to significantly prevent the feeling of feeling hungry quickly and even easily suppress the feeling of eating sweets that you cannot resist.
TR_176	8	For people who want to lose weight ideally in terms of both appearance and health, the technique of swallowing raw rice will be very useful and will stop weight gain both in the short and long term.
TR_176	9	Well, is it harmful to lose weight by swallowing rice, which is a subject that closely concerns those who want to get rid of their excess weight and accelerate fat burning?
TR_176	10	Rice has an appetite suppressant feature if swallowed raw.
TR_176	11	If you apply the rice swallowing method in the morning, you will be able to control your appetite during the day and you will not consume foods that contain excess calories.
TR_176	12	On the other hand, thanks to the technique of swallowing raw rice, you will prevent the desire to overeat, so it will be inevitable to lose weight and slim down.
TR_176	13	However, it is important to note that only ingesting raw rice will not help you lose excess weight and burn fat.
TR_176	14	With this method you will apply, you should also avoid the consumption of high-calorie foods at the same time.
TR_176	15	As soon as you put both of these into practice, you can realize the goal of losing weight and slimming down.
TR_176	16	The method of slimming by swallowing rice is applied as follows; on the first day, only one raw rice should be swallowed.
TR_176	17	You should swallow one grain of raw rice in the morning on an empty stomach and increase this amount one by one on the other days.
TR_176	18	On the thirtieth day, you should swallow thirty grains of raw rice, and on the thirty-first day you should reduce the number of grains one by one.
TR_176	19	When applying the raw rice ingestion method, which will continue for a total of sixty days, you need to swallow your rice with the help of a glass of warm water.
TR_176	20	If all the techniques mentioned from beginning to end are done correctly and completely, there is a weight loss of 8 to 14 pounds in 2 months.
TR_176	21	However, it should be noted that the rate of weight loss varies from person to person.
TR_176	22	If you see a positive effect of the raw rice ingestion method and want to apply the cure again, you should wait at least three months for this.
TR_176	23	There is no harm associated with eating raw rice that has been identified through scientific research.
TR_176	24	However, if you have an allergic reaction to rice or starch, you should seek specialist support in this context.
TR_176	25	If you want to swallow raw rice, be sure to consult your doctor first and foremost.

TR_187	1	Dha Foreign - Bombardment Turns Idlib into a Ruin
TR_187	2	The towns and villages in Idlib countryside on the border with Turkey, which is called the last stronghold of the opposition, have turned into ruins after the intense bombardment by the Russian-backed Assad regime.
TR_187	3	Thousands of people living in settlements here have been forced to migrate.
TR_187	4	In March 2011, demonstrations broke out in Syria, Turkey's neighboring country, in the process known as the 'Arab Spring' in the Middle East.
TR_187	5	As in other countries, Syrians took to the streets to demand more democracy and freedom.
TR_187	6	In Daraa, Syria, on March 15, 2011, regime forces responded to the civilians' request with fire.
TR_187	7	The incidents, which started with the loss of civilian lives, spread across the country in a short time.
TR_187	8	In response to the regime's attempts to prevent people from taking to the streets demanding democracy and freedom by firing on them, civilians responded by taking up arms, supported by soldiers who had left the army and joined them.
TR_187	9	The structure, which armed itself in a short time and called itself the 'Free Syrian Army', started clashing with the regime at many points.
TR_187	10	The FSA forces, which are the common point of the opponents of the regime and have set their new flag by adding the third star to the existing Syrian flag, have managed to take control of many settlements with their organized structure in every corner of the country in the process.
TR_187	11	However, over time, the fragmentation of the FSA due to disagreements within the FSA and the active role of terrorist organizations such as DAESH and PKK/PYD among the actors in Syria paved the way for the opposition to the regime to fight against each other.
TR_187	12	In many parts of the country, opposition groups started fighting among themselves instead of the regime, allowing the Bashar al-Assad regime to move more easily.
TR_187	13	Assad's regime forces have started to take back opposition-held areas in the country one by one with the external support they have received, especially from Russia.
TR_187	14	REGIME OPPONENTS DEPORTED TO IDLIB.
TR_187	15	The regime has forced opposition groups within the Free Syrian Army to lay down their arms by using chemical weapons in some areas or by preventing access to necessities such as water and food and threatening the lives of civilians.
TR_187	16	In many places, the opposition has agreed to cede areas to the regime, either voluntarily or compulsorily, to avoid civilian casualties.
TR_187	17	Regime forces have also authorized the evacuation of civilians from these areas and opposition fighters who laid down their arms to Idlib.
TR_187	18	Thus, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated from different parts of the country over the past few years have been forcibly relocated to Idlib, which is under the control of Hayat Tahriri Sham on the border with Turkey.
TR_187	19	Idlib, whose population has reached 4 million with the evacuations, has become known as 'Little Syria' due to the number of regime opponents coming from each city.
TR_187	20	THE LAST BASTION IS IDLIB.
TR_187	21	Troops loyal to the Assad regime took control of Daraa, the city that sparked the civil war in July last year.
TR_187	22	In Daraa, which the opposition lost, thousands of anti-regime protesters made their way to Idlib, as they did in other areas.
TR_187	23	Idlib, which is the last remaining urban center in the hands of the opposition with the loss of Daraa, has become the target of the Assad regime in the new process.
TR_187	24	Since August last year, Idlib has come under the regime's ground and aerial bombardment.
TR_187	25	POSSIBLE MASSACRE AVERTED BY TURKEY'S EFFORTS.
TR_187	26	Since August, Syrian regime troops, backed by Russian warplanes, have shelled the countryside south of Idlib and north of Hama from the ground and air.
TR_187	27	Hundreds of people were killed in the attacks, while thousands fled their homes and headed towards Idlib city center and the Turkish border.
TR_187	28	Concerned that a military operation could turn into a massacre with the deaths of thousands of civilians, Turkey, which has 12 bases in the region and also acts as the 'De-escalation Control Force', took action.
TR_187	29	With Turkey's diplomatic efforts, important progress has been made through trilateral summits between Turkey, Russia and Iran.
TR_187	30	The agreement reached at the summit in Sochi in September last year agreed to create a 15-kilometer de-escalation zone between the regime and the armed opposition.
TR_187	31	Following the agreement, airstrikes have ceased, ground attacks have decreased and thousands of displaced people have returned to their homes.
TR_187	32	THE ATTACKS HAVE RESUMED.
TR_187	33	However, as of February 9, the regime troops, with the support of Russia, started targeting areas in Idlib countryside and the city center again.
TR_187	34	Many villages, towns and districts in Idlib countryside have been under air and ground fire, forcing residents to flee.
TR_187	35	Attacks on these areas from the ground and air continued after the exodus.
TR_187	36	In Idlib, especially the districts of Jisr Shugur, Maaret Annuman, Khan Sheikhoun and the towns and villages connected to these districts have been devastated by the bombardments.
TR_187	37	Piles of rubble remain in neighborhoods and streets where people are rarely seen.
TR_187	38	TURKEY IS THE ONLY HOPE.
TR_187	39	Most of those who have fled these areas have started living in tents in camps on the Turkish border or in nearby olive groves.
TR_187	40	Turkey is the biggest hope for Syrian civilians who dream of returning to their homes after the attacks end.
TR_187	41	Civilians who want Turkey to step in say that the regime has violated all the agreements reached with Russia.
TR_187	42	Emphasizing that the regime's oppressive approach in the past has turned into bombardment today and that their lives are at risk, the civilians said that no country other than Turkey hears their voices.
TR_187	43	Civilians stated that they want to continue their lives in their homes in the lands where they were born and called on the world to put an end to Assad's oppression.

TR_218	1	I talked to Minister Mahmut Özer about teachers and exams
TR_218	2	class='medyanet-inline-adv'>WITHOUT EXAMS: Head teachers and specialist teachers will be selected by exam after a specific training.
TR_218	3	"What if there was no training, no exams, and it was said ""those who complete 10 years become specialists"" or ""those who complete 15 years become head teachers""..."
TR_218	4	Wouldn't it?
TR_218	5	Minister Özer strongly objects to the test being seen as offensive.
TR_218	6	"""There is no career without exams,"" he says and adds: ""In Turkey, the career system in every field is built with exams."""
TR_218	7	"The point he emphasizes the most is this: ""We are not measuring the teaching competence of our teachers."
TR_218	8	All our teachers are sufficient.
TR_218	9	We will only conduct an exam that evaluates the training received.
TR_218	10	"Just as you take the exam for the course you take in your master's degree, this is the same."""
TR_218	11	"HOW IN THE WORLD: One of the questions on my mind is: ""How does this work in the world?"
TR_218	12	Do developed countries consider teaching as a career profession?
TR_218	13	"Do they have specialized teachers, head teachers?"""
TR_218	14	Minister Özer gave many examples from around the world.
TR_218	15	According to this...
TR_218	16	"In Sweden there is a ""head teacher and a lector teacher""."
TR_218	17	In Poland, there are four career steps.
TR_218	18	In Italy there is a career ladder for teachers.
TR_218	19	In the UK, 95 percent of teachers are trained with a postgraduate degree.
TR_218	20	In Finland, teacher training is 6 years like medical training.
TR_218	21	In Belgium, France and the Netherlands, it is compulsory for all teachers to have a master's degree.
TR_218	22	In some states in the US, certified training for teachers must be renewed every five years.
TR_218	23	class='medyanet-inline-adv'> BUT WHY: I wonder why such a regulation was needed?
TR_218	24	So what will this regulation bring to the education system?
TR_218	25	I asked Minister Özer about this too.
TR_218	26	Minister Özer believes that this practice will encourage teachers to pursue master's and doctorate degrees.
TR_218	27	"He reminds that teachers with a master's degree will be exempt from the specialist teacher exam and those with a doctorate will be exempt from the head teacher exam, and adds: ""Our teachers are keen on postgraduate education."
TR_218	28	We decided to combine this desire with a career system.
TR_218	29	"I believe that in the coming years our teachers will intensively focus on master's and doctoral studies."""
TR_218	30	"Emphasizing that teachers are the pillars of the education system, Minister Özer says, ""If the teacher is strong, the education system will be strong."""
TR_218	31	"class='medyanet-inline-adv'> FAILURE: ""Won't teachers who receive training and take the exam but are not successful feel professionally inadequate?"""
TR_218	32	I also asked Minister Özer.
TR_218	33	"""We believe that all our teachers will be successful."
TR_218	34	We will publish sample question booklets in September to eliminate uncertainties.
TR_218	35	This is an exam that will be repeated every year.
TR_218	36	If not, they can continue again.
TR_218	37	Those who do not want to take the exam can do a master's degree.
TR_218	38	In any field.
TR_218	39	"There are no restrictions."""
TR_218	40	SALARY INCREASES: Specialists and head teachers will receive higher salaries.
TR_218	41	"This begs the question: ""In the end, they will all do the same job, but some will be paid more."
TR_218	42	"Isn't that a problem?"""
TR_218	43	"Minister Özer said, ""The system is open to all teachers."
TR_218	44	Increases in rank and salary depend on seniority and examination.
TR_218	45	The criteria are clear.
TR_218	46	Improvements in personal rights are encouraging.
TR_218	47	This is a mechanism that provides significant increases in personal rights.
TR_218	48	There is also no quota.

TR_219	15	According to a follow-up report by our correspondent Ali Naci Küçük on April 8, two important errors were found in the general assemblies held in October 2021 and March 26, 2022.

TR_219	17	class='medyanet-inline-adv'> The first belongs to the financial general assembly meeting held on October 15-16, 2021.
TR_219	18	Galatasaray Club could not hold a financial general assembly meeting for 2 periods due to the pandemic.
TR_219	19	For this reason, the 2019 and 2020 periods, which belonged to the late Galatasaray president Mustafa Cengiz, were put to a vote of release separately. The meeting was held on October 15, 2021 for the 2019 calendar and on October 16, 2021 for the 2020 calendar.
TR_219	20	Mustafa Cengiz's administration was not discharged administratively at the meeting on October 15.
TR_219	21	Interior Ministry inspectors drew attention to an important point at this meeting.
TR_219	22	THERE'S A MISTAKE IN THE LIST OF MEMBERS.
TR_219	23	At the Ordinary Financial General Assembly, which took place in October 2021 but covered the periods 2019 and 2020, it was learned that the 'list of attendance' was incorrect.
TR_219	24	The reason is as follows; delegates who are new members of Galatasaray Club also attended the meeting where the 2019-20 periods were evaluated and the release vote was held. On October 15, 2021, new members of the club in 2020 and 2021 attended the meeting and voted in the release vote.
TR_219	25	It is also stated that the participation of the names of new members in 202021 in the vote, which was delayed due to the pandemic and held for 2019, is against the procedure.

TR_219	28	Here we have information that a major mistake was made in the budget vote.
TR_219	29	The reason is that the budget prepared by its president Burak Elmas and his administration for the 2022 period is voted without being read.

TR_241	1	How do we overcome our map in karma?
TR_241	2	Karmically, the planetary or asteroid indicators positioned in the charts with the Rx retrograde and S stationary signs are often important keys that tell us what our shortcomings are, in which sign or degrees they are located, and what the content of those shortcomings actually is.
TR_241	3	Often in these signs are hidden the stories of the wrong deeds and behaviors we have committed.
TR_241	4	It is hidden because it waits for us to question, to discover, to realize.
TR_241	5	The more these retrograde and stationary indicators are, the more tasks and issues we have to complete in life.
TR_241	6	Can't every map owner complete the tasks in this process of evolution?
TR_241	7	There are 3 types of chart journeys, each with different karmic paths.
TR_241	8	"Dharmic Map; Derived from the word ""dharma"" meaning ""path"", this type of map has either no retro or static indicators or so few that they are ineffective."
TR_241	9	Dharmic maps are often referred to as mission maps.
TR_241	10	These chart holders have clean karma grades and are people who have come to life to complete certain tasks, perhaps to be pioneers or guides in their environment.
TR_241	11	Karmic Chart; in this type of charts there are retro indicators, more intense in some, less in others; the exams are more intense but still the chance to overcome the chart is given.
TR_241	12	Samsaric Chart; the name comes from the Samsara cycle, where the RX and S indicators are dense, which we call a bit stuck in the cycle.
TR_241	13	This is very difficult to overcome, a single life cycle may not be enough.
TR_241	14	Because the unresolved problems have overlapped and ossified.
TR_241	15	When we talk about retrospectives, we usually perceive them as bad behavior, but acting in a very good way, which is referred to as more valuable according to social judgments, can also create an objectionable karma.
TR_241	16	Being very well-intentioned, always giving, always undercutting, always helping, obeying and loving unconditionally... Maybe your unique map is trying to tell you that none of these things will work for you.
TR_241	17	Just as in psychology the intensity of this kind of behavior actually indicates the presence of a problem, in karma it is a problem.
TR_241	18	Familial structures, genetic codes, social judgments can sometimes lead each one of us to do more in some matters, they can impose on you that only this is right, but does this really work in your chart?
TR_241	19	Does your transformation journey support this?
TR_241	20	The underlying registers are sometimes fear, sometimes acceptance, sometimes a sense of belonging or staying connected, avoiding breaking habits, but this is also a karmic mistake.
TR_241	21	Because in karma everything is in balance and you are breaking the balance.
TR_241	22	"Let's take a person with Venus in Cancer and retrograde; you'll often hear ""I've pulled my hair out, I've done everything he loves, but I'm still not good enough""... This person will probably be exposed to more self-exploitative relationships until he/she learns to find a balance."
TR_241	23	"Or like a person with Mars retrograde who, in the face of a fight, attack or injustice done to him/her, says ""well, that was my fate"" and immediately surrenders, runs away from the battlefield or does not protect himself/herself... Until he/she realizes the power that exists in his/her own self and the way out of here, he/she will always continue to be exposed to attack."
TR_241	24	Karma doesn't want you to go to extremes, understanding karma is understanding nature; masculine-feminine, hot-cold, dark-light... It is waiting when it is necessary, it is fighting when it is necessary, it is defending itself when it is necessary; just because you realize this and step into awakening, the system can even pull you into a chaos you have never known.
TR_241	25	"This is exactly what you say afterwards, ""I was very upset at the time, but now when I look at it, I understand, now I realize why."""
TR_241	26	Becoming aware, gaining awareness... The important thing is that personal awareness can come into play before all other tools (mantra, stone, ritual...) join this journey of transformation.
TR_241	27	As it manages to keep these processes in balance, it allows for growth and rewards.
TR_241	28	That's why transcending karma is both easy in one way and difficult in another.
TR_241	29	Sometimes it's as easy as helping an elderly person, sometimes it's as hard as trying to overcome your judgment.
TR_241	30	It is especially difficult for guide charts involved in spiritual energy work, because the knowledge comes, followed by the test.
TR_241	31	You will be in such a situation that you may not know what to do in order to see if you will be able to overcome the lesson you teach in practice.
TR_241	32	The source of being able to cross the map is you and your ability to go on living without ego, without judgment.

TR_300	5	Governor Abdullah Erin made a speech at the ceremony.
TR_300	6	"Noting that in today's world, there is a small minority that holds the wealth in its hands, Governor Erin said, ""We are living in one of the rare times when human values are sacrificed due to the greed and greed of people."""
TR_300	7	Referring to the Syrian issue as one of the most important dramas in this context, Governor Erin stated that all humanity has been watching the troubles millions of people have been experiencing for nearly ten years due to the risk of death and life safety.
TR_300	8	Stating that those who seek remedies in the face of chaos, war and destruction are the real perpetrators of the event, Governor Erin said that the Syrian drama is an important situation in this sense.
TR_300	9	Governor Erin noted that the Republic of Turkey, under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told the whole world about the suffering and dramas and has provided all the assistance it can to the victimized masses, and drew attention to the Syrians living in Turkey for nine years, as well as the people from Idlib who have been crossing the border from Turkey.
TR_300	10	Governor Erin reminded that all kinds of support has been provided to the people who have taken refuge in Turkey for nine years, and that in addition to this, they continue to support hundreds of thousands of people living in the regions under Turkey's control after being cleared of terrorism in Syria.
TR_300	11	Stating that Turkey receives very little support from international organizations, Governor Erin said that CARE International is one of the rare organizations that takes concrete steps.

TR_300	17	Sherine Ibrahim stated that as an international non-governmental organization, they care about local sensitivities and therefore the projects proposed by the Governorate are important for them and that they are open to all kinds of cooperation.
TR_300	18	They visited the Microcredit House.
TR_300	19	After the signing ceremony at the Governor's Office, Governor Erin visited the center where the microcredit project is implemented in Haliliye district with the delegation of CARE Turkey Representation and met with the women who established their own business and marketed the products they produced with the loans they received.

TR_300	23	Urfahizmet
TR_M_002	1	We aim to realize an important mental transformation in this field by adding the fight against terrorism to the fight against terrorism.
TR_M_002	2	We will work with a holistic approach to fight against terrorism with development moves and social projects, from the increase in the quality of infrastructure services to the work in the fields of education and health.
TR_M_002	3	On the other hand, the total number of units in the Police and Gendarmerie organizations working on combating domestic violence and violence against women was increased to 1,247 in 2022.
TR_M_002	4	"We aim to utilize advanced technological tools in this field by integrating the ""Incident Recording and Risk Assessment Form"", an activity aimed at preventing possible future incidents in the fight against Domestic Violence and Violence against Women, into artificial intelligence."
TR_M_002	5	On the other hand, non-formal education and awareness raising activities within the scope of awareness is one of the important achievements of this period.
TR_M_002	6	In the coming period, we will continue policy processes, training programs and initiatives that will enhance public discourse unity and coordination in both proactive campaigns and crisis communication.
TR_M_002	7	In the presidential administration system, the harmonious work of all state institutions and the support of the private sector to this stable structure with increased production have laid the foundation for the Turkish Century in many areas such as health, industry, education and technology.
TR_M_002	8	"For those who think they are the owners of the system in Turkey, who see themselves as the state party, to come out now and say ""we are making peace"" does not fit the political reality."
TR_M_002	9	We have witnessed in the past what happens in the minds of those who have coded themselves as a state party.
TR_M_002	10	It is not possible and will never be possible for this mentality, which interferes in what citizens wear, how they speak, in which schools they attend and what kind of education they receive, to be pluralist, libertarian, inclusive and encompassing like the AK Party, and to pave the way for the freedom of the nation with an attitude that does not marginalize or exclude.
TR_M_002	11	As our fourth important characteristic, we should point out that the AK Party is not a party where some people want to rule the state for their own self-sufficiency, but a democratic and reformist political movement that has made great efforts to fight against internal and external tutelage centers and has made great efforts for this cause.
TR_M_002	12	With revolutionary reforms in education, health, law, economy and many other areas, the AK Party ended the civil and military bureaucratic oligarchy regime that thought it was the owner of the state and the system, and demonstrated through its practices that it recognized no master other than the nation, no human power other than the nation, and no word above the word of the nation.
TR_M_002	13	In the current years, we have upgraded this from 'transformative reformism' to 'complementary reformism'.
TR_M_002	14	We achieved this as conservative revolutionaries, in the people, empowered by the people and fighting against the centers of tutelage day by day.

TR_M_004	3	We increased the care support paid to severely disabled veterans every month with their pensions from one minimum wage to two minimum wages.
TR_M_004	4	Since 2016, we have provided minimum wage support to an average of 1.6 million workplaces. In 2023, we are providing a minimum wage support of 400 TL per worker per month.
TR_M_004	5	We abolished taxes on the minimum wage and introduced tax exemption for earnings up to the minimum wage in all income groups.
TR_M_004	6	With this historic step, we have increased the welfare level of all our employees, workers and civil servants.
TR_M_004	7	With the additional measures we took in this period, we aimed to alleviate the difficulties of our citizens due to the cost of living.

TR_M_004	9	In 2023, we adopted an approach that will increase the welfare of our employees while determining the net minimum wage to be applied.
TR_M_004	10	In this framework, the minimum wage was increased by 54.66 percent compared to July 2022 and by 100 percent compared to January 2022 and was set at 8,507 TL net.
TR_M_004	11	In order to increase the qualifications of tourism workers, foreign language and skills training courses are provided for 6 months at Vocational Training Centers and trainees are paid minimum wage.
TR_M_004	12	In addition, 2,884 courses were organized in 20 years to increase the qualifications of employees working in the tourism sector and on-the-job training was provided to 73 thousand sector employees.
TR_M_004	13	In addition, the fees paid to lawyers for legal aid services are gradually increased as stipulated in the minimum fee tariff for lawyers.
TR_M_004	14	We have introduced a lower limit for the pension granted to the parents of martyred soldiers and conscripts and ensured that it is not less than the minimum wage.
TR_M_017	1	A decisive fight will be waged by using all military, political, economic, social and psychological means against all terrorist organizations, especially PKK, FETÖ, Seleﬁ Jihadist Organizations, and all other terrorist organizations, especially PKK, FETÖ, and Seleﬁ Jihadist Organizations, that are plaguing our nation, and against globally linked terrorist elements that threaten our borders and turn our country into an arena of action and eliminate human rights and freedoms, especially the right to life, through acts of violence.
TR_M_017	2	Every precaution will be taken to prevent a FETÖ-like uprising from ever happening again and a real and long-term fight against FETÖ, the most important internal enemy, will be launched.
TR_M_017	3	Exposing the perpetrators of the July 15 attempt, those who aided and abetted them, and ensuring that justice is done is our debt of honor to the 249 martyrs martyred by FETÖ and their relatives.
TR_M_017	4	Our main priority in the fight against terrorism is to neutralize all kinds of terrorist activities that threaten the civilian democratic order, aim at the national will and involve violence through intelligence and preventive measures before they turn into actions.
TR_M_017	5	For the permanent solution of the Eastern and Southeastern issue, our party adopts as its basic policy that our security forces should continue their armed struggle against the terrorist organization without making any concessions, that the terrorist organization should be defeated militarily and the psychological superiority should be transferred to the civilian understanding, that the people of the region should be embraced with positive interventions in the social sphere through legal, political, economic, social and cultural projects on the one hand, and on the other hand, the exploitation areas in the hands of the terrorist organization should be eliminated.
TR_M_017	6	In the world order established after the Second World War, Turkey took its place within Western institutions.
TR_M_017	7	Our country's defense policy is also integrated into the Western security system.
TR_M_017	8	NATO is the supreme umbrella for defense policy.
TR_M_017	9	The fact that Turkey is under the NATO umbrella does not prevent it from implementing national policies and strategies.
TR_M_017	10	NATO is a political organization that also meets the defense needs of its members.
TR_M_017	11	Turkey's membership in this alliance will be carried out in cooperation with countries in other alliances and mechanisms in accordance with its national interests and national security.
TR_M_017	12	The most important requirement for a national army is a national defense industry.
TR_M_017	13	It is not possible for the national army to act independently in line with national interests unless it is equipped in accordance with the conditions of the day.
TR_M_017	14	The defense industry will be encouraged and all kinds of support will be provided in order to meet all the requirements of the army with national resources.
TR_M_017	15	The domestic design and production of critical technologies, primarily software-intensive technologies such as command and control and firing systems, will be encouraged.
TR_M_017	16	The defense industry policy, which will be based on Industry 4.0, will ensure that the Turkish army will be in a position to make its regional power felt as soon as possible.
TR_M_017	17	In the long term, the defense industry will be structured on the basis of continuity in a way that will not only meet its own needs, but also sustain its existence in the international competitive environment and contribute to our economy.
TR_M_017	18	Necessary measures will be taken to integrate the experience of military factories and shipyards into the private sector.

TR_M_024	5	On the other hand, it will be ensured that our country possesses sensitive nuclear technology, including advanced technologies that can be used at all levels of science and technology.
TR_M_024	6	Hydroelectric energy production will be increased by utilizing the water potential, which is one of the clean energy resources, at the highest level.
